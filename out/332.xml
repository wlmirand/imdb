    Embracing the right Atmosphere, this is a slightly better than Average Serial Killer Movie that loses some attempted perversity with its lack of exploration into the Misfit Mind of these Human Anomalies. Just what makes them tick, we always ask. Most of the time they are highly intelligent, cunning, and are so out there that they seem like Aliens or Demons in Human form. But here little time is spent on Personality or Character Demystification. It is sacrificed for uninteresting Police Procedures and Crime Scenes and Thriller Movie Clich&eacute;s. The two Leads, as always, deliver credibility to their Roles, but as sincere and gifted as Ashley Judd may be, this may be a slight bit of Miscasting. Morgan Freeman is fine as the Black Forensic Psychologist Alex Cross, from the Novels. Technically, as Cross points out, this is not a Serial Killer in the (im)purist sense. He is a Collector who Kills only when his Living Dolls misbehave. Then he unfeelingly disposes of them like so many Chatty Cathy's. In the end, it is worth a view, but is not very well thought out and the Script lets the whole thing feel a lot less intelligent than the Characters, on both sides of the Law deserve.

    It sure as hell beats watching Along Came A Spider or Alex Cross with Tyler Perry (Reviews coming soon) But there is nothing all that special about this movie. Despite its draggy moments at times, I was never truly bored. The mystery surrounding it did just enough to maintain my interest, but that's about it. It delivers some decent suspense throughout, but I saw the ending coming a mile away, and it wasn't too hard to figure out. Morgan Freeman is as solid as ever here as Dr. Cross. He can do this stuff in his sleep, but he was still very engaging to watch. I liked his chemistry with Ashley Judd as well. Ashley Judd is pretty good as well. She plays the sympathetic victim to a T and I was on her side the whole way. Cary Elwes is decent in his role. I either like him or get annoyed at him in his roles. I guess you can say I have a love and hate relationship with the guy. Tony Goldwyn, Jay O. Sanders, and Brian Cox provide decent support. Final Thoughts: It's not bad. Despite some draggy moments here and there, it maintains your interest for the most part. Don't expect Se7ven, and you'll be fine. 6/10

    Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd give award winning performances in my mind,, Tony Goldwyn also does a fine job acting in this picture,, a forensic psychologist is called in on a case when women end up missing or dead,, among those missing are his niece, so he has a personal involvement in the case.. another woman narrowly escapes with her life from the grasp of the killer, and goes on national TV to explain what happened to her , as to bring out the killer, there she meets Alex Cross the forensic psychologist,, and together those two will team up to try and find the killer or killers.. very intriguing movie,, very fast paced action packed, thrill ride to the finish,, freeman and judd give fine performances in this picture,, this is a definite recommend to anyone a fan of the genre.

    Any film that starts off with Morgan Freeman (Alex Cross) in the scene and blues playing in the background must be worth watching, mustn't it? The story is that Alex Cross is a cop and forensic psychologist who manages to talk a young woman out of a suicide attempt. He then learns that his niece is missing. He learns that the police think she's among the victims of someone who kidnaps and kills young girls. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), one of kidnapped victims, escapes and tries to help Cross find his niece. The film is an odd mix. Good acting by the leads, good camera-work. But somehow, it does not draw you in. You don't ultimately care whether Cross finds his niece or uncovers the killer. And what is the killer's true motive? It's slowly paced but does not develop adequately. However, if you like Morgan Freeman, you'll probably like this and, let's face it, most people do. 6/10

    Forensic pathologist police blokie Alex Cross finds it all gets a bit personal when his niece is kidnapped. Fortunately, there's a lady doctor knocking around who has escaped from this particular perpetrator. Even so, there is something very unexpected waiting... Morgan Freeman plays Cross again in this second outing for James Paterson's main fictional character, and Freeman adds his usual dramatic weight to the goings on (Ashley Judd as the doctor is also very good, and the support cast are uniformly reliable). My reservation is that the story is no better than OK. A first viewing of this is going to be fine, but second time round I found myself wanting it to be rather better than it is. Perhaps I'm just getting more demanding in my old age.

    Although it begins with several clich&eacute;s, there are twists and turns coming soon and surprises last until the very end - I had several guesses about the possible villain, but did not figure it out. The cast is evenly strong, leading by Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross and Ashley Judd as Dr. Kate McTiernan - their synergy and acting is really splendid (those behind the movie Alex Cross from 2012 should blush at least). The tensions are always visible, even in calm scenes, and frequent new angles make watching very catchy. Recommendable to all fond of crime movies without supernatural elements, as well as to fans of Freeman and Judd.

    After enduring the dross that is ALEX CROSS (2012), I decided to revisit the earlier two feature films featuring the character, as I remembered them being reasonably enjoyable thrillers. Seeing the most recent movie reinforces certain factors Â– just how good Morgan Freeman was in the role (he is, after all, a professional character actor) and just how well made in terms of scripting, cinematography and direction they were. KISS THE GIRLS sees Cross on a mission to rescue his niece from the clutches of a serial abductor and killer operating out of North Carolina. When links are unearthed to another homicidal nutbar in Los Angeles the case becomes more complicated. Sort of a crossplot (ha!). The acting is first rate, the story moves at a nice clip and the atmosphere of Gothic ambiance is effectively rendered. A good little psycho-thriller with some smart, edgy scenes and decent performances.

    "Things to Do In Denver When You're Dead" director Gary Fleder's "Kiss the Girls" is an above-average but uneven crime thriller that benefits from a surprise or two. Morgan Freeman plays the heroic detective who saves the day, while Ashley Judd is cast as one of the victims. "Kiss the Girls" represents the first of the big-screen cinematic adaptations of bestselling author James Patterson's novels. A first-class cast and polished production values cannot compensate for this generally routine thriller that features an unusual number of villains. The early scenes involving our heroine's incarceration and escape as well as a last minute rescue when our hero discovers who is helping the villains behind the scenes stand out. Everything else is basically a police procedural that Fleder doesn't orchestrate with more than the usual suspense and tension. The uneven quality of the film is seen in the Judd character who starts out as an active character but later degenerates into just another victim. Washington, D.C. forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is searching for his missing niece when a lady, Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), is abducted by a predator who calls himself Casanova. This wily fellow sneaks into her house and captures her. Casanova imprisons Kate in a cave in the woods along with several other missing women. One of these missing women is Naomi Cross (Gina Ravera of "Soul Food") who has a talent for playing the violin. Kate is an intelligent physician who also practices kick boxing and those kick boxing skills enable her to break out. Miraculously, Kate manages to escape from the cave where the other women and she were held hostage. She plunges herself into a mountain waterfall and winds up in the hospital. Dr. Cross checks up on Kate and determines that she is still on a drug. The attending physician, Dr. Ruocco (Roma Maffia), purges the narcotic from her bloodstream and she holds a news conference from her hospital where she announces to the media that she and only she alone escaped without help from his prison. She cooperates with the authorities to track down the evil predator responsible for her abduction as well as the abductions of other women. Dr. Cross and Kate travel to Los Angeles where they experience a close encounter with a predator, Dr. William 'Will' Rudolph (Tony Goldwyn of "Ghost"), who eludes them. The authorities link Dr. Rudolph from the West Coast with another predator, Dr. Wick Sachs (William Converse-Roberts of "Crazy in Alabama"), who lives on the East Coast. When Cross interrogates him, Dr. Sachs mentions his niece and Cross assaults him and has to be restrained by the FBI. Later, Cross and Kate comb the North Carolina woods where she was found. About 90 minutes into the action, Cross stumbles onto the underground lair where the abducted women are being held. He kills Dr. Rudolph in a roadside shoot-out and rescues his niece. Just when Cross thinks that he has solved the case, he discovers a loose end and races off in his Porsche to save the damsel-in-distress. The cross-cutting between Cross careening across town in his sports car and Kate tangling with the villain in her kitchen caps off this literate but run-of-the-mill assailant. Nevertheless, the way that Cross takes out the killer with a milk carton is cool. "Kiss the Girls" is an okay thriller and Cary Elwes is good. Look for Billy Blanks in a cameo as Ashley Judd's kick-boxing coach.

    Kiss the Girls is a thriller film that features Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. The screenplay by David Klass is based on the best-selling novel of the same title by James Patterson.It was directed by Gary Fleder. Forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Freeman) is also a best-selling author that works with Washington DC Police. After his niece Naomi is reported missing, he heads to Durham, North Carolina, where eight young women have been reported missing. Bodies are found by local policemen along with the killer's signature,Casanova.The killer is a "collector" of strong-willed women who are forced to submit to his demands. Soon, local doctor Kate McTiernan (Judd) is abducted from her home and taken into custody -- where other women are imprisoned in underground chambers. After McTiernan succeeds in escaping, she joins Cross and other detectives in the search for Casanova -- a trail that leads to Los Angeles, where similar crimes are being committed by someone known as The Gentleman Caller.Are Casanova and The Gentleman Caller the same person? The movie is similar to Silence Of The Lambs especially with the abduction of women.But not only that,it is a rehash of many elements found in thriller genre and provides nothing new.The performances are average except for Freeman,who just happens to be a good actor.While the beauteous Ashley Judd is pleasing to the eye despite of being annoying at times. In short,the movie is pretty much average that would satisfy only those who are into these type of movie genres.

    Okay so these books start out with along came the spider. But this movie came out first. Doesn't matter just thought you should know. These books are my favorite they are suspenseful, tricky, mindblowing, and detailed. It even has lovable characters which have nothing to do with this movie. Alex (freeman) is supposed to be ripped, 30, fit, and good looking (not that freeman isn't.). He has kids in the books which add a lot, he was in love with kate, who was supposed to be prettier and blonde. Casanova and the gentleman caller were supposedly strikingly handsome, and rippling muscles, i mean it just takes out so much of the story. Davey sikes was supposed to be like sampson (who also wasn't exact but nothing to complain he was just supposed to be younger) A "man mountai" as the book called him. and i watched along came a spider and it was just bad. The only relation was the fact that a guy kidnaps a rich girl and A FEW OF the characters names.. but there was supposed to be a boy to which added way more to the story. Movie may be good but definitely read the book first so the movie doesn't spoil. James Patterson DID AMMAZING on these concepts. COnceptrs that wouldv'e taken me years to even get close to it. New, non clich&eacute;d crimes.

The only relation was the fact that a guy kidnaps a rich girl and A FEW OF the characters names.. but there was supposed to be a boy to which added way more to the story. Movie may be good but definitely read the book first so the movie doesn't spoil. James Patterson DID AMMAZING on these concepts. COnceptrs that wouldv'e taken me years to even get close to it.

    Embracing the right Atmosphere, this is a slightly better than Average Serial Killer Movie that loses some attempted perversity with its lack of exploration into the Misfit Mind of these Human Anomalies. Just what makes them tick, we always ask. Most of the time they are highly intelligent, cunning, and are so out there that they seem like Aliens or Demons in Human form. But here little time is spent on Personality or Character Demystification. It is sacrificed for uninteresting Police Procedures and Crime Scenes and Thriller Movie Clich&eacute;s. The two Leads, as always, deliver credibility to their Roles, but as sincere and gifted as Ashley Judd may be, this may be a slight bit of Miscasting. Morgan Freeman is fine as the Black Forensic Psychologist Alex Cross, from the Novels. Technically, as Cross points out, this is not a Serial Killer in the (im)purist sense. He is a Collector who Kills only when his Living Dolls misbehave. Then he unfeelingly disposes of them like so many Chatty Cathy's. In the end, it is worth a view, but is not very well thought out and the Script lets the whole thing feel a lot less intelligent than the Characters, on both sides of the Law deserve.

    It sure as hell beats watching Along Came A Spider or Alex Cross with Tyler Perry (Reviews coming soon) But there is nothing all that special about this movie. Despite its draggy moments at times, I was never truly bored. The mystery surrounding it did just enough to maintain my interest, but that's about it. It delivers some decent suspense throughout, but I saw the ending coming a mile away, and it wasn't too hard to figure out. Morgan Freeman is as solid as ever here as Dr. Cross. He can do this stuff in his sleep, but he was still very engaging to watch. I liked his chemistry with Ashley Judd as well. Ashley Judd is pretty good as well. She plays the sympathetic victim to a T and I was on her side the whole way. Cary Elwes is decent in his role. I either like him or get annoyed at him in his roles. I guess you can say I have a love and hate relationship with the guy. Tony Goldwyn, Jay O. Sanders, and Brian Cox provide decent support. Final Thoughts: It's not bad. Despite some draggy moments here and there, it maintains your interest for the most part. Don't expect Se7ven, and you'll be fine. 6/10

    Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd give award winning performances in my mind,, Tony Goldwyn also does a fine job acting in this picture,, a forensic psychologist is called in on a case when women end up missing or dead,, among those missing are his niece, so he has a personal involvement in the case.. another woman narrowly escapes with her life from the grasp of the killer, and goes on national TV to explain what happened to her , as to bring out the killer, there she meets Alex Cross the forensic psychologist,, and together those two will team up to try and find the killer or killers.. very intriguing movie,, very fast paced action packed, thrill ride to the finish,, freeman and judd give fine performances in this picture,, this is a definite recommend to anyone a fan of the genre.

    Any film that starts off with Morgan Freeman (Alex Cross) in the scene and blues playing in the background must be worth watching, mustn't it? The story is that Alex Cross is a cop and forensic psychologist who manages to talk a young woman out of a suicide attempt. He then learns that his niece is missing. He learns that the police think she's among the victims of someone who kidnaps and kills young girls. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), one of kidnapped victims, escapes and tries to help Cross find his niece. The film is an odd mix. Good acting by the leads, good camera-work. But somehow, it does not draw you in. You don't ultimately care whether Cross finds his niece or uncovers the killer. And what is the killer's true motive? It's slowly paced but does not develop adequately. However, if you like Morgan Freeman, you'll probably like this and, let's face it, most people do. 6/10

    Forensic pathologist police blokie Alex Cross finds it all gets a bit personal when his niece is kidnapped. Fortunately, there's a lady doctor knocking around who has escaped from this particular perpetrator. Even so, there is something very unexpected waiting... Morgan Freeman plays Cross again in this second outing for James Paterson's main fictional character, and Freeman adds his usual dramatic weight to the goings on (Ashley Judd as the doctor is also very good, and the support cast are uniformly reliable). My reservation is that the story is no better than OK. A first viewing of this is going to be fine, but second time round I found myself wanting it to be rather better than it is. Perhaps I'm just getting more demanding in my old age.

    Although it begins with several clich&eacute;s, there are twists and turns coming soon and surprises last until the very end - I had several guesses about the possible villain, but did not figure it out. The cast is evenly strong, leading by Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross and Ashley Judd as Dr. Kate McTiernan - their synergy and acting is really splendid (those behind the movie Alex Cross from 2012 should blush at least). The tensions are always visible, even in calm scenes, and frequent new angles make watching very catchy. Recommendable to all fond of crime movies without supernatural elements, as well as to fans of Freeman and Judd.

    After enduring the dross that is ALEX CROSS (2012), I decided to revisit the earlier two feature films featuring the character, as I remembered them being reasonably enjoyable thrillers. Seeing the most recent movie reinforces certain factors Â– just how good Morgan Freeman was in the role (he is, after all, a professional character actor) and just how well made in terms of scripting, cinematography and direction they were. KISS THE GIRLS sees Cross on a mission to rescue his niece from the clutches of a serial abductor and killer operating out of North Carolina. When links are unearthed to another homicidal nutbar in Los Angeles the case becomes more complicated. Sort of a crossplot (ha!). The acting is first rate, the story moves at a nice clip and the atmosphere of Gothic ambiance is effectively rendered. A good little psycho-thriller with some smart, edgy scenes and decent performances.

    "Things to Do In Denver When You're Dead" director Gary Fleder's "Kiss the Girls" is an above-average but uneven crime thriller that benefits from a surprise or two. Morgan Freeman plays the heroic detective who saves the day, while Ashley Judd is cast as one of the victims. "Kiss the Girls" represents the first of the big-screen cinematic adaptations of bestselling author James Patterson's novels. A first-class cast and polished production values cannot compensate for this generally routine thriller that features an unusual number of villains. The early scenes involving our heroine's incarceration and escape as well as a last minute rescue when our hero discovers who is helping the villains behind the scenes stand out. Everything else is basically a police procedural that Fleder doesn't orchestrate with more than the usual suspense and tension. The uneven quality of the film is seen in the Judd character who starts out as an active character but later degenerates into just another victim. Washington, D.C. forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is searching for his missing niece when a lady, Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), is abducted by a predator who calls himself Casanova. This wily fellow sneaks into her house and captures her. Casanova imprisons Kate in a cave in the woods along with several other missing women. One of these missing women is Naomi Cross (Gina Ravera of "Soul Food") who has a talent for playing the violin. Kate is an intelligent physician who also practices kick boxing and those kick boxing skills enable her to break out. Miraculously, Kate manages to escape from the cave where the other women and she were held hostage. She plunges herself into a mountain waterfall and winds up in the hospital. Dr. Cross checks up on Kate and determines that she is still on a drug. The attending physician, Dr. Ruocco (Roma Maffia), purges the narcotic from her bloodstream and she holds a news conference from her hospital where she announces to the media that she and only she alone escaped without help from his prison. She cooperates with the authorities to track down the evil predator responsible for her abduction as well as the abductions of other women. Dr. Cross and Kate travel to Los Angeles where they experience a close encounter with a predator, Dr. William 'Will' Rudolph (Tony Goldwyn of "Ghost"), who eludes them. The authorities link Dr. Rudolph from the West Coast with another predator, Dr. Wick Sachs (William Converse-Roberts of "Crazy in Alabama"), who lives on the East Coast. When Cross interrogates him, Dr. Sachs mentions his niece and Cross assaults him and has to be restrained by the FBI. Later, Cross and Kate comb the North Carolina woods where she was found. About 90 minutes into the action, Cross stumbles onto the underground lair where the abducted women are being held. He kills Dr. Rudolph in a roadside shoot-out and rescues his niece. Just when Cross thinks that he has solved the case, he discovers a loose end and races off in his Porsche to save the damsel-in-distress. The cross-cutting between Cross careening across town in his sports car and Kate tangling with the villain in her kitchen caps off this literate but run-of-the-mill assailant. Nevertheless, the way that Cross takes out the killer with a milk carton is cool. "Kiss the Girls" is an okay thriller and Cary Elwes is good. Look for Billy Blanks in a cameo as Ashley Judd's kick-boxing coach.

    Kiss the Girls is a thriller film that features Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. The screenplay by David Klass is based on the best-selling novel of the same title by James Patterson.It was directed by Gary Fleder. Forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Freeman) is also a best-selling author that works with Washington DC Police. After his niece Naomi is reported missing, he heads to Durham, North Carolina, where eight young women have been reported missing. Bodies are found by local policemen along with the killer's signature,Casanova.The killer is a "collector" of strong-willed women who are forced to submit to his demands. Soon, local doctor Kate McTiernan (Judd) is abducted from her home and taken into custody -- where other women are imprisoned in underground chambers. After McTiernan succeeds in escaping, she joins Cross and other detectives in the search for Casanova -- a trail that leads to Los Angeles, where similar crimes are being committed by someone known as The Gentleman Caller.Are Casanova and The Gentleman Caller the same person? The movie is similar to Silence Of The Lambs especially with the abduction of women.But not only that,it is a rehash of many elements found in thriller genre and provides nothing new.The performances are average except for Freeman,who just happens to be a good actor.While the beauteous Ashley Judd is pleasing to the eye despite of being annoying at times. In short,the movie is pretty much average that would satisfy only those who are into these type of movie genres.

    Okay so these books start out with along came the spider. But this movie came out first. Doesn't matter just thought you should know. These books are my favorite they are suspenseful, tricky, mindblowing, and detailed. It even has lovable characters which have nothing to do with this movie. Alex (freeman) is supposed to be ripped, 30, fit, and good looking (not that freeman isn't.). He has kids in the books which add a lot, he was in love with kate, who was supposed to be prettier and blonde. Casanova and the gentleman caller were supposedly strikingly handsome, and rippling muscles, i mean it just takes out so much of the story. Davey sikes was supposed to be like sampson (who also wasn't exact but nothing to complain he was just supposed to be younger) A "man mountai" as the book called him. and i watched along came a spider and it was just bad. The only relation was the fact that a guy kidnaps a rich girl and A FEW OF the characters names.. but there was supposed to be a boy to which added way more to the story.

But here little time is spent on Personality or Character Demystification. It is sacrificed for uninteresting Police Procedures and Crime Scenes and Thriller Movie Clich&eacute;s. The two Leads, as always, deliver credibility to their Roles, but as sincere and gifted as Ashley Judd may be, this may be a slight bit of Miscasting. Morgan Freeman is fine as the Black Forensic Psychologist Alex Cross, from the Novels. Technically, as Cross points out, this is not a Serial Killer in the (im)purist sense. He is a Collector who Kills only when his Living Dolls misbehave. Then he unfeelingly disposes of them like so many Chatty Cathy's. In the end, it is worth a view, but is not very well thought out and the Script lets the whole thing feel a lot less intelligent than the Characters, on both sides of the Law deserve.

    It sure as hell beats watching Along Came A Spider or Alex Cross with Tyler Perry (Reviews coming soon) But there is nothing all that special about this movie. Despite its draggy moments at times, I was never truly bored. The mystery surrounding it did just enough to maintain my interest, but that's about it. It delivers some decent suspense throughout, but I saw the ending coming a mile away, and it wasn't too hard to figure out. Morgan Freeman is as solid as ever here as Dr. Cross. He can do this stuff in his sleep, but he was still very engaging to watch. I liked his chemistry with Ashley Judd as well. Ashley Judd is pretty good as well. She plays the sympathetic victim to a T and I was on her side the whole way. Cary Elwes is decent in his role. I either like him or get annoyed at him in his roles. I guess you can say I have a love and hate relationship with the guy. Tony Goldwyn, Jay O. Sanders, and Brian Cox provide decent support. Final Thoughts: It's not bad. Despite some draggy moments here and there, it maintains your interest for the most part. Don't expect Se7ven, and you'll be fine. 6/10

    Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd give award winning performances in my mind,, Tony Goldwyn also does a fine job acting in this picture,, a forensic psychologist is called in on a case when women end up missing or dead,, among those missing are his niece, so he has a personal involvement in the case.. another woman narrowly escapes with her life from the grasp of the killer, and goes on national TV to explain what happened to her , as to bring out the killer, there she meets Alex Cross the forensic psychologist,, and together those two will team up to try and find the killer or killers.. very intriguing movie,, very fast paced action packed, thrill ride to the finish,, freeman and judd give fine performances in this picture,, this is a definite recommend to anyone a fan of the genre.

    Any film that starts off with Morgan Freeman (Alex Cross) in the scene and blues playing in the background must be worth watching, mustn't it? The story is that Alex Cross is a cop and forensic psychologist who manages to talk a young woman out of a suicide attempt. He then learns that his niece is missing. He learns that the police think she's among the victims of someone who kidnaps and kills young girls. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), one of kidnapped victims, escapes and tries to help Cross find his niece. The film is an odd mix. Good acting by the leads, good camera-work. But somehow, it does not draw you in. You don't ultimately care whether Cross finds his niece or uncovers the killer. And what is the killer's true motive? It's slowly paced but does not develop adequately. However, if you like Morgan Freeman, you'll probably like this and, let's face it, most people do. 6/10

    Forensic pathologist police blokie Alex Cross finds it all gets a bit personal when his niece is kidnapped. Fortunately, there's a lady doctor knocking around who has escaped from this particular perpetrator. Even so, there is something very unexpected waiting... Morgan Freeman plays Cross again in this second outing for James Paterson's main fictional character, and Freeman adds his usual dramatic weight to the goings on (Ashley Judd as the doctor is also very good, and the support cast are uniformly reliable). My reservation is that the story is no better than OK. A first viewing of this is going to be fine, but second time round I found myself wanting it to be rather better than it is. Perhaps I'm just getting more demanding in my old age.

    Although it begins with several clich&eacute;s, there are twists and turns coming soon and surprises last until the very end - I had several guesses about the possible villain, but did not figure it out. The cast is evenly strong, leading by Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross and Ashley Judd as Dr. Kate McTiernan - their synergy and acting is really splendid (those behind the movie Alex Cross from 2012 should blush at least). The tensions are always visible, even in calm scenes, and frequent new angles make watching very catchy. Recommendable to all fond of crime movies without supernatural elements, as well as to fans of Freeman and Judd.

    After enduring the dross that is ALEX CROSS (2012), I decided to revisit the earlier two feature films featuring the character, as I remembered them being reasonably enjoyable thrillers. Seeing the most recent movie reinforces certain factors Â– just how good Morgan Freeman was in the role (he is, after all, a professional character actor) and just how well made in terms of scripting, cinematography and direction they were. KISS THE GIRLS sees Cross on a mission to rescue his niece from the clutches of a serial abductor and killer operating out of North Carolina. When links are unearthed to another homicidal nutbar in Los Angeles the case becomes more complicated. Sort of a crossplot (ha!). The acting is first rate, the story moves at a nice clip and the atmosphere of Gothic ambiance is effectively rendered. A good little psycho-thriller with some smart, edgy scenes and decent performances.

    "Things to Do In Denver When You're Dead" director Gary Fleder's "Kiss the Girls" is an above-average but uneven crime thriller that benefits from a surprise or two. Morgan Freeman plays the heroic detective who saves the day, while Ashley Judd is cast as one of the victims. "Kiss the Girls" represents the first of the big-screen cinematic adaptations of bestselling author James Patterson's novels. A first-class cast and polished production values cannot compensate for this generally routine thriller that features an unusual number of villains. The early scenes involving our heroine's incarceration and escape as well as a last minute rescue when our hero discovers who is helping the villains behind the scenes stand out. Everything else is basically a police procedural that Fleder doesn't orchestrate with more than the usual suspense and tension. The uneven quality of the film is seen in the Judd character who starts out as an active character but later degenerates into just another victim. Washington, D.C. forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is searching for his missing niece when a lady, Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), is abducted by a predator who calls himself Casanova. This wily fellow sneaks into her house and captures her. Casanova imprisons Kate in a cave in the woods along with several other missing women. One of these missing women is Naomi Cross (Gina Ravera of "Soul Food") who has a talent for playing the violin. Kate is an intelligent physician who also practices kick boxing and those kick boxing skills enable her to break out. Miraculously, Kate manages to escape from the cave where the other women and she were held hostage. She plunges herself into a mountain waterfall and winds up in the hospital. Dr. Cross checks up on Kate and determines that she is still on a drug. The attending physician, Dr. Ruocco (Roma Maffia), purges the narcotic from her bloodstream and she holds a news conference from her hospital where she announces to the media that she and only she alone escaped without help from his prison. She cooperates with the authorities to track down the evil predator responsible for her abduction as well as the abductions of other women. Dr. Cross and Kate travel to Los Angeles where they experience a close encounter with a predator, Dr. William 'Will' Rudolph (Tony Goldwyn of "Ghost"), who eludes them. The authorities link Dr. Rudolph from the West Coast with another predator, Dr. Wick Sachs (William Converse-Roberts of "Crazy in Alabama"), who lives on the East Coast. When Cross interrogates him, Dr. Sachs mentions his niece and Cross assaults him and has to be restrained by the FBI. Later, Cross and Kate comb the North Carolina woods where she was found. About 90 minutes into the action, Cross stumbles onto the underground lair where the abducted women are being held. He kills Dr. Rudolph in a roadside shoot-out and rescues his niece. Just when Cross thinks that he has solved the case, he discovers a loose end and races off in his Porsche to save the damsel-in-distress. The cross-cutting between Cross careening across town in his sports car and Kate tangling with the villain in her kitchen caps off this literate but run-of-the-mill assailant. Nevertheless, the way that Cross takes out the killer with a milk carton is cool. "Kiss the Girls" is an okay thriller and Cary Elwes is good. Look for Billy Blanks in a cameo as Ashley Judd's kick-boxing coach.

    Kiss the Girls is a thriller film that features Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. The screenplay by David Klass is based on the best-selling novel of the same title by James Patterson.It was directed by Gary Fleder. Forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Freeman) is also a best-selling author that works with Washington DC Police. After his niece Naomi is reported missing, he heads to Durham, North Carolina, where eight young women have been reported missing. Bodies are found by local policemen along with the killer's signature,Casanova.The killer is a "collector" of strong-willed women who are forced to submit to his demands. Soon, local doctor Kate McTiernan (Judd) is abducted from her home and taken into custody -- where other women are imprisoned in underground chambers. After McTiernan succeeds in escaping, she joins Cross and other detectives in the search for Casanova -- a trail that leads to Los Angeles, where similar crimes are being committed by someone known as The Gentleman Caller.Are Casanova and The Gentleman Caller the same person? The movie is similar to Silence Of The Lambs especially with the abduction of women.But not only that,it is a rehash of many elements found in thriller genre and provides nothing new.The performances are average except for Freeman,who just happens to be a good actor.While the beauteous Ashley Judd is pleasing to the eye despite of being annoying at times. In short,the movie is pretty much average that would satisfy only those who are into these type of movie genres.

    Okay so these books start out with along came the spider. But this movie came out first. Doesn't matter just thought you should know. These books are my favorite they are suspenseful, tricky, mindblowing, and detailed. It even has lovable characters which have nothing to do with this movie. Alex (freeman) is supposed to be ripped, 30, fit, and good looking (not that freeman isn't.). He has kids in the books which add a lot, he was in love with kate, who was supposed to be prettier and blonde. Casanova and the gentleman caller were supposedly strikingly handsome, and rippling muscles, i mean it just takes out so much of the story. Davey sikes was supposed to be like sampson (who also wasn't exact but nothing to complain he was just supposed to be younger) A "man mountai" as the book called him. and i watched along came a spider and it was just bad. The only relation was the fact that a guy kidnaps a rich girl and A FEW OF the characters names.. but there was supposed to be a boy to which added way more to the story. Movie may be good but definitely read the book first so the movie doesn't spoil. James Patterson DID AMMAZING on these concepts. COnceptrs that wouldv'e taken me years to even get close to it. New, non clich&eacute;d crimes.

    It sure as hell beats watching Along Came A Spider or Alex Cross with Tyler Perry (Reviews coming soon) But there is nothing all that special about this movie. Despite its draggy moments at times, I was never truly bored. The mystery surrounding it did just enough to maintain my interest, but that's about it. It delivers some decent suspense throughout, but I saw the ending coming a mile away, and it wasn't too hard to figure out. Morgan Freeman is as solid as ever here as Dr. Cross. He can do this stuff in his sleep, but he was still very engaging to watch. I liked his chemistry with Ashley Judd as well. Ashley Judd is pretty good as well. She plays the sympathetic victim to a T and I was on her side the whole way. Cary Elwes is decent in his role. I either like him or get annoyed at him in his roles. I guess you can say I have a love and hate relationship with the guy. Tony Goldwyn, Jay O. Sanders, and Brian Cox provide decent support. Final Thoughts: It's not bad. Despite some draggy moments here and there, it maintains your interest for the most part. Don't expect Se7ven, and you'll be fine. 6/10

    Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd give award winning performances in my mind,, Tony Goldwyn also does a fine job acting in this picture,, a forensic psychologist is called in on a case when women end up missing or dead,, among those missing are his niece, so he has a personal involvement in the case.. another woman narrowly escapes with her life from the grasp of the killer, and goes on national TV to explain what happened to her , as to bring out the killer, there she meets Alex Cross the forensic psychologist,, and together those two will team up to try and find the killer or killers.. very intriguing movie,, very fast paced action packed, thrill ride to the finish,, freeman and judd give fine performances in this picture,, this is a definite recommend to anyone a fan of the genre.

    Any film that starts off with Morgan Freeman (Alex Cross) in the scene and blues playing in the background must be worth watching, mustn't it? The story is that Alex Cross is a cop and forensic psychologist who manages to talk a young woman out of a suicide attempt. He then learns that his niece is missing. He learns that the police think she's among the victims of someone who kidnaps and kills young girls. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), one of kidnapped victims, escapes and tries to help Cross find his niece. The film is an odd mix. Good acting by the leads, good camera-work. But somehow, it does not draw you in. You don't ultimately care whether Cross finds his niece or uncovers the killer. And what is the killer's true motive? It's slowly paced but does not develop adequately. However, if you like Morgan Freeman, you'll probably like this and, let's face it, most people do. 6/10

    Forensic pathologist police blokie Alex Cross finds it all gets a bit personal when his niece is kidnapped. Fortunately, there's a lady doctor knocking around who has escaped from this particular perpetrator. Even so, there is something very unexpected waiting... Morgan Freeman plays Cross again in this second outing for James Paterson's main fictional character, and Freeman adds his usual dramatic weight to the goings on (Ashley Judd as the doctor is also very good, and the support cast are uniformly reliable). My reservation is that the story is no better than OK. A first viewing of this is going to be fine, but second time round I found myself wanting it to be rather better than it is. Perhaps I'm just getting more demanding in my old age.

    Although it begins with several clich&eacute;s, there are twists and turns coming soon and surprises last until the very end - I had several guesses about the possible villain, but did not figure it out. The cast is evenly strong, leading by Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross and Ashley Judd as Dr. Kate McTiernan - their synergy and acting is really splendid (those behind the movie Alex Cross from 2012 should blush at least). The tensions are always visible, even in calm scenes, and frequent new angles make watching very catchy. Recommendable to all fond of crime movies without supernatural elements, as well as to fans of Freeman and Judd.

    After enduring the dross that is ALEX CROSS (2012), I decided to revisit the earlier two feature films featuring the character, as I remembered them being reasonably enjoyable thrillers. Seeing the most recent movie reinforces certain factors Â– just how good Morgan Freeman was in the role (he is, after all, a professional character actor) and just how well made in terms of scripting, cinematography and direction they were. KISS THE GIRLS sees Cross on a mission to rescue his niece from the clutches of a serial abductor and killer operating out of North Carolina. When links are unearthed to another homicidal nutbar in Los Angeles the case becomes more complicated. Sort of a crossplot (ha!). The acting is first rate, the story moves at a nice clip and the atmosphere of Gothic ambiance is effectively rendered. A good little psycho-thriller with some smart, edgy scenes and decent performances.

    "Things to Do In Denver When You're Dead" director Gary Fleder's "Kiss the Girls" is an above-average but uneven crime thriller that benefits from a surprise or two. Morgan Freeman plays the heroic detective who saves the day, while Ashley Judd is cast as one of the victims. "Kiss the Girls" represents the first of the big-screen cinematic adaptations of bestselling author James Patterson's novels. A first-class cast and polished production values cannot compensate for this generally routine thriller that features an unusual number of villains. The early scenes involving our heroine's incarceration and escape as well as a last minute rescue when our hero discovers who is helping the villains behind the scenes stand out. Everything else is basically a police procedural that Fleder doesn't orchestrate with more than the usual suspense and tension. The uneven quality of the film is seen in the Judd character who starts out as an active character but later degenerates into just another victim. Washington, D.C. forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is searching for his missing niece when a lady, Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), is abducted by a predator who calls himself Casanova. This wily fellow sneaks into her house and captures her. Casanova imprisons Kate in a cave in the woods along with several other missing women. One of these missing women is Naomi Cross (Gina Ravera of "Soul Food") who has a talent for playing the violin. Kate is an intelligent physician who also practices kick boxing and those kick boxing skills enable her to break out. Miraculously, Kate manages to escape from the cave where the other women and she were held hostage. She plunges herself into a mountain waterfall and winds up in the hospital. Dr. Cross checks up on Kate and determines that she is still on a drug. The attending physician, Dr. Ruocco (Roma Maffia), purges the narcotic from her bloodstream and she holds a news conference from her hospital where she announces to the media that she and only she alone escaped without help from his prison. She cooperates with the authorities to track down the evil predator responsible for her abduction as well as the abductions of other women. Dr. Cross and Kate travel to Los Angeles where they experience a close encounter with a predator, Dr. William 'Will' Rudolph (Tony Goldwyn of "Ghost"), who eludes them. The authorities link Dr. Rudolph from the West Coast with another predator, Dr. Wick Sachs (William Converse-Roberts of "Crazy in Alabama"), who lives on the East Coast. When Cross interrogates him, Dr. Sachs mentions his niece and Cross assaults him and has to be restrained by the FBI. Later, Cross and Kate comb the North Carolina woods where she was found. About 90 minutes into the action, Cross stumbles onto the underground lair where the abducted women are being held. He kills Dr. Rudolph in a roadside shoot-out and rescues his niece. Just when Cross thinks that he has solved the case, he discovers a loose end and races off in his Porsche to save the damsel-in-distress. The cross-cutting between Cross careening across town in his sports car and Kate tangling with the villain in her kitchen caps off this literate but run-of-the-mill assailant. Nevertheless, the way that Cross takes out the killer with a milk carton is cool. "Kiss the Girls" is an okay thriller and Cary Elwes is good. Look for Billy Blanks in a cameo as Ashley Judd's kick-boxing coach.

    Kiss the Girls is a thriller film that features Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. The screenplay by David Klass is based on the best-selling novel of the same title by James Patterson.It was directed by Gary Fleder. Forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Freeman) is also a best-selling author that works with Washington DC Police. After his niece Naomi is reported missing, he heads to Durham, North Carolina, where eight young women have been reported missing. Bodies are found by local policemen along with the killer's signature,Casanova.The killer is a "collector" of strong-willed women who are forced to submit to his demands. Soon, local doctor Kate McTiernan (Judd) is abducted from her home and taken into custody -- where other women are imprisoned in underground chambers. After McTiernan succeeds in escaping, she joins Cross and other detectives in the search for Casanova -- a trail that leads to Los Angeles, where similar crimes are being committed by someone known as The Gentleman Caller.Are Casanova and The Gentleman Caller the same person? The movie is similar to Silence Of The Lambs especially with the abduction of women.But not only that,it is a rehash of many elements found in thriller genre and provides nothing new.The performances are average except for Freeman,who just happens to be a good actor.While the beauteous Ashley Judd is pleasing to the eye despite of being annoying at times. In short,the movie is pretty much average that would satisfy only those who are into these type of movie genres.

    Okay so these books start out with along came the spider. But this movie came out first. Doesn't matter just thought you should know. These books are my favorite they are suspenseful, tricky, mindblowing, and detailed. It even has lovable characters which have nothing to do with this movie. Alex (freeman) is supposed to be ripped, 30, fit, and good looking (not that freeman isn't.). He has kids in the books which add a lot, he was in love with kate, who was supposed to be prettier and blonde. Casanova and the gentleman caller were supposedly strikingly handsome, and rippling muscles, i mean it just takes out so much of the story. Davey sikes was supposed to be like sampson (who also wasn't exact but nothing to complain he was just supposed to be younger) A "man mountai" as the book called him. and i watched along came a spider and it was just bad. The only relation was the fact that a guy kidnaps a rich girl and A FEW OF the characters names.. but there was supposed to be a boy to which added way more to the story. Movie may be good but definitely read the book first so the movie doesn't spoil. James Patterson DID AMMAZING on these concepts. COnceptrs that wouldv'e taken me years to even get close to it. New, non clich&eacute;d crimes.

    Embracing the right Atmosphere, this is a slightly better than Average Serial Killer Movie that loses some attempted perversity with its lack of exploration into the Misfit Mind of these Human Anomalies. Just what makes them tick, we always ask. Most of the time they are highly intelligent, cunning, and are so out there that they seem like Aliens or Demons in Human form. But here little time is spent on Personality or Character Demystification. It is sacrificed for uninteresting Police Procedures and Crime Scenes and Thriller Movie Clich&eacute;s. The two Leads, as always, deliver credibility to their Roles, but as sincere and gifted as Ashley Judd may be, this may be a slight bit of Miscasting. Morgan Freeman is fine as the Black Forensic Psychologist Alex Cross, from the Novels. Technically, as Cross points out, this is not a Serial Killer in the (im)purist sense. He is a Collector who Kills only when his Living Dolls misbehave. Then he unfeelingly disposes of them like so many Chatty Cathy's. In the end, it is worth a view, but is not very well thought out and the Script lets the whole thing feel a lot less intelligent than the Characters, on both sides of the Law deserve.

    Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd give award winning performances in my mind,, Tony Goldwyn also does a fine job acting in this picture,, a forensic psychologist is called in on a case when women end up missing or dead,, among those missing are his niece, so he has a personal involvement in the case.. another woman narrowly escapes with her life from the grasp of the killer, and goes on national TV to explain what happened to her , as to bring out the killer, there she meets Alex Cross the forensic psychologist,, and together those two will team up to try and find the killer or killers.. very intriguing movie,, very fast paced action packed, thrill ride to the finish,, freeman and judd give fine performances in this picture,, this is a definite recommend to anyone a fan of the genre.

    Any film that starts off with Morgan Freeman (Alex Cross) in the scene and blues playing in the background must be worth watching, mustn't it? The story is that Alex Cross is a cop and forensic psychologist who manages to talk a young woman out of a suicide attempt. He then learns that his niece is missing. He learns that the police think she's among the victims of someone who kidnaps and kills young girls. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), one of kidnapped victims, escapes and tries to help Cross find his niece. The film is an odd mix. Good acting by the leads, good camera-work. But somehow, it does not draw you in. You don't ultimately care whether Cross finds his niece or uncovers the killer. And what is the killer's true motive? It's slowly paced but does not develop adequately. However, if you like Morgan Freeman, you'll probably like this and, let's face it, most people do. 6/10

    Forensic pathologist police blokie Alex Cross finds it all gets a bit personal when his niece is kidnapped. Fortunately, there's a lady doctor knocking around who has escaped from this particular perpetrator. Even so, there is something very unexpected waiting... Morgan Freeman plays Cross again in this second outing for James Paterson's main fictional character, and Freeman adds his usual dramatic weight to the goings on (Ashley Judd as the doctor is also very good, and the support cast are uniformly reliable). My reservation is that the story is no better than OK. A first viewing of this is going to be fine, but second time round I found myself wanting it to be rather better than it is. Perhaps I'm just getting more demanding in my old age.

    Although it begins with several clich&eacute;s, there are twists and turns coming soon and surprises last until the very end - I had several guesses about the possible villain, but did not figure it out. The cast is evenly strong, leading by Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross and Ashley Judd as Dr. Kate McTiernan - their synergy and acting is really splendid (those behind the movie Alex Cross from 2012 should blush at least). The tensions are always visible, even in calm scenes, and frequent new angles make watching very catchy. Recommendable to all fond of crime movies without supernatural elements, as well as to fans of Freeman and Judd.

    After enduring the dross that is ALEX CROSS (2012), I decided to revisit the earlier two feature films featuring the character, as I remembered them being reasonably enjoyable thrillers. Seeing the most recent movie reinforces certain factors Â– just how good Morgan Freeman was in the role (he is, after all, a professional character actor) and just how well made in terms of scripting, cinematography and direction they were. KISS THE GIRLS sees Cross on a mission to rescue his niece from the clutches of a serial abductor and killer operating out of North Carolina. When links are unearthed to another homicidal nutbar in Los Angeles the case becomes more complicated. Sort of a crossplot (ha!). The acting is first rate, the story moves at a nice clip and the atmosphere of Gothic ambiance is effectively rendered. A good little psycho-thriller with some smart, edgy scenes and decent performances.

    "Things to Do In Denver When You're Dead" director Gary Fleder's "Kiss the Girls" is an above-average but uneven crime thriller that benefits from a surprise or two. Morgan Freeman plays the heroic detective who saves the day, while Ashley Judd is cast as one of the victims. "Kiss the Girls" represents the first of the big-screen cinematic adaptations of bestselling author James Patterson's novels. A first-class cast and polished production values cannot compensate for this generally routine thriller that features an unusual number of villains. The early scenes involving our heroine's incarceration and escape as well as a last minute rescue when our hero discovers who is helping the villains behind the scenes stand out. Everything else is basically a police procedural that Fleder doesn't orchestrate with more than the usual suspense and tension. The uneven quality of the film is seen in the Judd character who starts out as an active character but later degenerates into just another victim. Washington, D.C. forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is searching for his missing niece when a lady, Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), is abducted by a predator who calls himself Casanova. This wily fellow sneaks into her house and captures her. Casanova imprisons Kate in a cave in the woods along with several other missing women. One of these missing women is Naomi Cross (Gina Ravera of "Soul Food") who has a talent for playing the violin. Kate is an intelligent physician who also practices kick boxing and those kick boxing skills enable her to break out. Miraculously, Kate manages to escape from the cave where the other women and she were held hostage. She plunges herself into a mountain waterfall and winds up in the hospital. Dr. Cross checks up on Kate and determines that she is still on a drug. The attending physician, Dr. Ruocco (Roma Maffia), purges the narcotic from her bloodstream and she holds a news conference from her hospital where she announces to the media that she and only she alone escaped without help from his prison. She cooperates with the authorities to track down the evil predator responsible for her abduction as well as the abductions of other women. Dr. Cross and Kate travel to Los Angeles where they experience a close encounter with a predator, Dr. William 'Will' Rudolph (Tony Goldwyn of "Ghost"), who eludes them. The authorities link Dr. Rudolph from the West Coast with another predator, Dr. Wick Sachs (William Converse-Roberts of "Crazy in Alabama"), who lives on the East Coast. When Cross interrogates him, Dr. Sachs mentions his niece and Cross assaults him and has to be restrained by the FBI. Later, Cross and Kate comb the North Carolina woods where she was found. About 90 minutes into the action, Cross stumbles onto the underground lair where the abducted women are being held. He kills Dr. Rudolph in a roadside shoot-out and rescues his niece. Just when Cross thinks that he has solved the case, he discovers a loose end and races off in his Porsche to save the damsel-in-distress. The cross-cutting between Cross careening across town in his sports car and Kate tangling with the villain in her kitchen caps off this literate but run-of-the-mill assailant. Nevertheless, the way that Cross takes out the killer with a milk carton is cool. "Kiss the Girls" is an okay thriller and Cary Elwes is good. Look for Billy Blanks in a cameo as Ashley Judd's kick-boxing coach.

    Kiss the Girls is a thriller film that features Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. The screenplay by David Klass is based on the best-selling novel of the same title by James Patterson.It was directed by Gary Fleder. Forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Freeman) is also a best-selling author that works with Washington DC Police. After his niece Naomi is reported missing, he heads to Durham, North Carolina, where eight young women have been reported missing. Bodies are found by local policemen along with the killer's signature,Casanova.The killer is a "collector" of strong-willed women who are forced to submit to his demands. Soon, local doctor Kate McTiernan (Judd) is abducted from her home and taken into custody -- where other women are imprisoned in underground chambers. After McTiernan succeeds in escaping, she joins Cross and other detectives in the search for Casanova -- a trail that leads to Los Angeles, where similar crimes are being committed by someone known as The Gentleman Caller.Are Casanova and The Gentleman Caller the same person? The movie is similar to Silence Of The Lambs especially with the abduction of women.But not only that,it is a rehash of many elements found in thriller genre and provides nothing new.The performances are average except for Freeman,who just happens to be a good actor.While the beauteous Ashley Judd is pleasing to the eye despite of being annoying at times. In short,the movie is pretty much average that would satisfy only those who are into these type of movie genres.

    Okay so these books start out with along came the spider. But this movie came out first. Doesn't matter just thought you should know. These books are my favorite they are suspenseful, tricky, mindblowing, and detailed. It even has lovable characters which have nothing to do with this movie. Alex (freeman) is supposed to be ripped, 30, fit, and good looking (not that freeman isn't.). He has kids in the books which add a lot, he was in love with kate, who was supposed to be prettier and blonde. Casanova and the gentleman caller were supposedly strikingly handsome, and rippling muscles, i mean it just takes out so much of the story. Davey sikes was supposed to be like sampson (who also wasn't exact but nothing to complain he was just supposed to be younger) A "man mountai" as the book called him. and i watched along came a spider and it was just bad. The only relation was the fact that a guy kidnaps a rich girl and A FEW OF the characters names.. but there was supposed to be a boy to which added way more to the story. Movie may be good but definitely read the book first so the movie doesn't spoil. James Patterson DID AMMAZING on these concepts. COnceptrs that wouldv'e taken me years to even get close to it. New, non clich&eacute;d crimes.

    Embracing the right Atmosphere, this is a slightly better than Average Serial Killer Movie that loses some attempted perversity with its lack of exploration into the Misfit Mind of these Human Anomalies. Just what makes them tick, we always ask. Most of the time they are highly intelligent, cunning, and are so out there that they seem like Aliens or Demons in Human form. But here little time is spent on Personality or Character Demystification. It is sacrificed for uninteresting Police Procedures and Crime Scenes and Thriller Movie Clich&eacute;s. The two Leads, as always, deliver credibility to their Roles, but as sincere and gifted as Ashley Judd may be, this may be a slight bit of Miscasting. Morgan Freeman is fine as the Black Forensic Psychologist Alex Cross, from the Novels. Technically, as Cross points out, this is not a Serial Killer in the (im)purist sense. He is a Collector who Kills only when his Living Dolls misbehave. Then he unfeelingly disposes of them like so many Chatty Cathy's. In the end, it is worth a view, but is not very well thought out and the Script lets the whole thing feel a lot less intelligent than the Characters, on both sides of the Law deserve.

    It sure as hell beats watching Along Came A Spider or Alex Cross with Tyler Perry (Reviews coming soon) But there is nothing all that special about this movie. Despite its draggy moments at times, I was never truly bored. The mystery surrounding it did just enough to maintain my interest, but that's about it. It delivers some decent suspense throughout, but I saw the ending coming a mile away, and it wasn't too hard to figure out. Morgan Freeman is as solid as ever here as Dr. Cross. He can do this stuff in his sleep, but he was still very engaging to watch. I liked his chemistry with Ashley Judd as well. Ashley Judd is pretty good as well. She plays the sympathetic victim to a T and I was on her side the whole way. Cary Elwes is decent in his role. I either like him or get annoyed at him in his roles. I guess you can say I have a love and hate relationship with the guy. Tony Goldwyn, Jay O. Sanders, and Brian Cox provide decent support. Final Thoughts: It's not bad. Despite some draggy moments here and there, it maintains your interest for the most part. Don't expect Se7ven, and you'll be fine. 6/10
