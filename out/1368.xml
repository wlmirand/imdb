    This film follows the relationship of two Jewish students living in Paris, and how their initially deep friendship gradually drifts apart. It is powerful and will remind some viewers of the natural (albeit sometimes very sad) loss of friendship. One girl (Ethel) tends to do quite well, whilst the other (Mina) is more sensitive and finds more difficulties in life, as she is very introvert. It concludes with a powerful climax. I enjoyed every moment of this film, it is well directed, the acting is flawless, and it was a really moving, touching film. Perhaps ultimately emphasizing the importance of good friendships. Highly recommended!
