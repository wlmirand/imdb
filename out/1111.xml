 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Twenty-two year old Chinese-Canadian Jade Li comes from a traditional Chinese family, who try to put on the perfect public persona at all cost so as to "save face". One primary part of this persona is prosperity. Jade's father hopes that true financial prosperity will become reality through penny stocks. Because of its instability, Jade's parents don't understand or widely publicize Jade's aspirations to be an actress. Their main want for Jade is to date and marry a nice Chinese boy, a goal for which Jade's extended family also strives as they are always trying to introduce her to Chinese boys. They believe that *the* boy is Andrew, with who Jade even agrees to go out. But Jade, beyond wanting to be an actress, wishes her family had more western sensibilities. She is attracted to a slightly awkward but persistent Caucasian English graduate student named Mark. Jade has to figure out how to both please her family, who would not approve of her dating a Caucasian, and be true to herself.

    This is for the user who was puzzled by the scene in which someone pours water on the date with whom she was set up. He has taken her from the restaurant to a bar where all the other patrons are men. She realizes that it's a gay bar and that's the way he has chosen to tell her that he did not choose to take her out anymore than she chose to go out with him and that they are both in the same boat, i.e., leading double lives. The person who pours water on him apparently does so to rebuke him for being with a woman. I was particularly interested by the reviewers who are of Chinese or other East Asian descent and who resonated to the predicament of the heroine. It reminds me somewhat of the original of Fiddler on the Roof, in which the daughter who runs of with a gentile is mourned as if dead by Tevye and his family.

    This movie was a nice little picture about a group of Asans living in Canada and they all seemed like nice people, despite the differences in how they adapt to living in a new land. The parents are very traditional and want their daughter to marry a traditional Chinese man. I like their portrayal because they want what's best for her and are not ogres. The daughter, who is NOT tradition-bound wants to make her own way in life and resists her parents by "doing her own thing" when they aren't looking. The acting and writing is excellent, as the story rings true to life. If you like this movie, I strongly recommend EAT, DRINK, MAN WOMAN--a Taiwanese film that covers some of the same ground but seems to do an even better job (if that's even possible!). NOTE: since first reviewing this movie, I saw BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood. It's another Canadian film but this time instead of focusing on Chinese culture, it concerns Indian culture. It, too, involves the older generations pushing their kids NOT to marry Caucasians but find a nice boy or girl from back home. Very similar and just as wonderful as DOUBLE HAPPINESS. Watch them both!

    Sandra Oh is at the center of "Double Happiness", a dramady about a Chinese twenty-something immigrant living with her family in Canada, struggling to find work as an actress, while being torn between the ways of the West and the traditional values of her dogmatic parents. An award winning film with nominally satisfactory reviews, this little budget-conscious effort is fraught with low end production value, scenes which simply don't work (like the incredibly unprofessional casting call with a Hong Kong company rep), bad jokes (like the peanut thing, the phone number thing, etc.), mediocre music, zero atmospherics (meeting your boyfriend at a construction site??), a poor ending, and a general absence of auterusmanship. Nonetheless, "Double Happiness" limps along with some poignant moments, a giggle here, some angst there, and maybe even a sentimental pang now and then. An okay cable watch for anyone with time to spare who's in the mood for a Chinese-Canadian generation gap flick. Note - I have always thought Oh was much more skilled than she was marketable. It's nice to see her in a leading role and though she doesn't nail all of her nuances in this flick, the responsibility for that probably belongs with the director. (C+)

    Humor and pathos are mixed in this study of the cultural and social clashes between a Chinese-Canadian daughter and her traditional parents. Sometimes give and take are not the solution. Not the easiest movie to watch. Sandra Oh shows much promise. Also in the cast are:Daniel Fong, Greg Chen, Alannah Ong and Claudette Carracedo.

    This picture is really just Sandra Oh. If you fall in love with her (as I did, even in her other pics), the film is a delight. Otherwise, there isn't much there. But Sandra Oh has that wonderful inexplicable quality of making you just want to be there with her, and watching this movie is rather like watching a bad film with Sandra sitting on the sofa next to you, quipping like the bots on MST3K.

    Mina Shum wrote and directed this story of a Chinese-Canadian family in Vancouver with the central character being Jade (Sandra Oh). Jade's father Quo (Stephen Chang) is very strict about his children following old Chinese traditions and if they don't then they are disowned by him. So Jade actually tries to live two separate lives, one an obedient daughter who goes along with her fathers wishes (For the most part) and when she is out with her friends she can be a normal woman in her early 20's who talk about boys and goes to clubs. Jade wants to be an actress much to the chagrin of her parents and she goes out on auditions. One night she meets a man named Mark who is white and they have a one night stand. Jade's parents do not know him at first and fix her up on dates with Chinese men. They're is some excellent visual imagery in the film and in one scene Jade and Mark are on swings and the shot is in slow motion with a good and effective musical score to enhance the visual flair. In another scene a fed up Jade gets out of the car of another date and starts to run down the street. We are not told where she is running to but we must assume its to Mark. Sandra Oh's performance seems to be flawless. Watching her character ultimately give up trying to please her father is just riveting to watch. I've always been a big fan of Oh's and I thought she was equally terrific in "Dancing at the Blue Iguana". Oh takes the character of Jade and makes her not only smart and strong, but makes her very human also! When a casting director asks her how could she possibly think of herself as Chinese if she cannot read it, Jade at this point in the film questions herself and ultimately comes to a life changing decision. Mina Shums script is sharp and she doesn't portray Jade's parents as one dimensional. They have issues as well and it affects the lives of their children. Well written script gives Oh the opportunity to give a totally convincing and haunting performance.

    This was a cute, sweet small movie about a Chinese-Canadian woman caught between her dreams and her father's expectations. Complaints about the film center on what some see as the director's one-sided depiction of the anti-assimilation viewpoint. Jade's father is so concerned that his children live within the constricts of traditional Chinese culture that he cuts off contact with them entirely if they stray. But Mina Shum (the director) never claims that his rigidity is the rule; the story is about how Jade deals with the specific situation, and it makes no claim that her situation is pervasive. Other Asian characters have different levels of acceptance of Western openness: Jade's mother, while not openly defying her husband, maintains contact with her son whom his father has cut off completely. So "Double Happiness" isn't an anti-Asian traditionalism screed, as some have claimed, neither is it an Everywoman story of freedom as some seem to want it to be. It's simply Jade's story about choosing between her dreams and the man she's falling in love with against her father's uncompromising worldview. Mechanically, the movie is good if not a masterpiece. The performances are excellent. Sandra Oh is charged with almost singlehandedly winning over the viewer, and she's completely up to the challenge. All performances are (as far as I can tell anyway) wonderfully authentic. This was Callum Keith Rennie's first major role, and he's as awkward, sweet, and appealing as ever. The interstitial scenes of characters speaking to the camera are an interesting experiment--a good tool for revealing character, they nevertheless are sometimes jarring. Overall, the film is like a compact colorful flower: it won't dominate the landscape but it richly awards the lucky soul whose attention it captures.

    "Double Happiness" is a very disappointing first feature from director Mina Shum. The characters thin, the writing lackluster, and the direction uninspired, this film received attention due to its "ethnic" subject matter at a number of festivals upon its release in 1995. "Double Happiness" garnered favorable reviews from a handful of critics who, in the progressive world of cinema and media arts, were probably reluctant to note the film's many flaws for fear of being labeled insensitive to Asian culture. (It was this critical attention that probably managed to secure the film limited distribution in North America.) However, despite a strong performance by newcomer Sandra Oh (HBO's "Arliss") and strong lensing, there's little to distinguish this empty comedy from the myriad of low budget features that, deservedly, never find an audience. There's little originality in "Double Happiness" and that's a shame. This reviewer won't give away any spoilers, but suffice it to say the story moves along at an expectable pace, and every story beat and and plot point comes in a paint-by-the numbers fashion. Jade Lee is the free-spririted, hip young woman in conflict with her traditional family. She must stand up for herself and seek her own identity. That's probably a compelling story but, in "Double Happiness," it's one not well told. Rather than portraying the character and theme through real development of character, conflict and emotion, we're given about 90 minutes stiff dialogue and forced drama/comedy. This story deserved better and so did the audience. A real shame indeed.

    Mina Shum's Double Happiness bravely explores a group that mainstream film (read: Hollywood) continues to ignore: Asians in North America. That the film features strong acting, good writing and confident direction makes its accomplishments all the more greater. You don't need to be Asian to enjoy this film, anymore than you have to be Italian to watch The Godfathers. Young women of whatever ethnic backgrounds are bound to identify with the lead character, finely played by Sandra Oh. The daughter-father conflict crosses all national boundaries, and is explored in this film through the eyes of Chinese-Canadians. I'm a Canadian of Chinese descent, and found the characterizations of the family to be accurate overall. At times, the domineering Father is one-dimensional (tyrannical and cold) and needed to be fleshed out more. The role of the siblings--especially towards their parents--was underplayed and could have offered a contrast to the main relationship between the elder daughter and Dad. Still, the strict traditionalism of the parents was on the nose, and the struggles of the daughter, Jade, ring true. In fact, I venture to say that Jade was played *too* obediently, and should have broken from her family sooner. Following this line of thought, the film could have been expanded to explore Jade moving into her own home and finding her own career as an actress, then reconciling (perhaps) with her stern Father at the end. As it stands, the movie ends abruptly and too soon. Shum and Oh do a fine job of getting Jade on the audience's side, only pull the carpet on her just as she leaves home. The movie begs for closure in the relationship between daughter and father. Perhaps in the sequel.

    This is an excellent movie portraying the struggle of any Asian child: personal goals over family expectations. Every one of us go through Jade's life and it's a very challenging goal. It's impossible to please yourself and please your family at the same time. As an Asian kid myself, I strongly advise for you to do whatever makes you happy.

    This movie was a nice little picture about a group of Asans living in Canada and they all seemed like nice people, despite the differences in how they adapt to living in a new land. The parents are very traditional and want their daughter to marry a traditional Chinese man. I like their portrayal because they want what's best for her and are not ogres. The daughter, who is NOT tradition-bound wants to make her own way in life and resists her parents by "doing her own thing" when they aren't looking. The acting and writing is excellent, as the story rings true to life. If you like this movie, I strongly recommend EAT, DRINK, MAN WOMAN--a Taiwanese film that covers some of the same ground but seems to do an even better job (if that's even possible!). NOTE: since first reviewing this movie, I saw BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood. It's another Canadian film but this time instead of focusing on Chinese culture, it concerns Indian culture. It, too, involves the older generations pushing their kids NOT to marry Caucasians but find a nice boy or girl from back home. Very similar and just as wonderful as DOUBLE HAPPINESS. Watch them both!

    Sandra Oh is at the center of "Double Happiness", a dramady about a Chinese twenty-something immigrant living with her family in Canada, struggling to find work as an actress, while being torn between the ways of the West and the traditional values of her dogmatic parents. An award winning film with nominally satisfactory reviews, this little budget-conscious effort is fraught with low end production value, scenes which simply don't work (like the incredibly unprofessional casting call with a Hong Kong company rep), bad jokes (like the peanut thing, the phone number thing, etc.), mediocre music, zero atmospherics (meeting your boyfriend at a construction site??), a poor ending, and a general absence of auterusmanship. Nonetheless, "Double Happiness" limps along with some poignant moments, a giggle here, some angst there, and maybe even a sentimental pang now and then. An okay cable watch for anyone with time to spare who's in the mood for a Chinese-Canadian generation gap flick. Note - I have always thought Oh was much more skilled than she was marketable. It's nice to see her in a leading role and though she doesn't nail all of her nuances in this flick, the responsibility for that probably belongs with the director. (C+)

    Humor and pathos are mixed in this study of the cultural and social clashes between a Chinese-Canadian daughter and her traditional parents. Sometimes give and take are not the solution. Not the easiest movie to watch. Sandra Oh shows much promise. Also in the cast are:Daniel Fong, Greg Chen, Alannah Ong and Claudette Carracedo.

    This picture is really just Sandra Oh. If you fall in love with her (as I did, even in her other pics), the film is a delight. Otherwise, there isn't much there. But Sandra Oh has that wonderful inexplicable quality of making you just want to be there with her, and watching this movie is rather like watching a bad film with Sandra sitting on the sofa next to you, quipping like the bots on MST3K.

    Mina Shum wrote and directed this story of a Chinese-Canadian family in Vancouver with the central character being Jade (Sandra Oh). Jade's father Quo (Stephen Chang) is very strict about his children following old Chinese traditions and if they don't then they are disowned by him. So Jade actually tries to live two separate lives, one an obedient daughter who goes along with her fathers wishes (For the most part) and when she is out with her friends she can be a normal woman in her early 20's who talk about boys and goes to clubs. Jade wants to be an actress much to the chagrin of her parents and she goes out on auditions. One night she meets a man named Mark who is white and they have a one night stand. Jade's parents do not know him at first and fix her up on dates with Chinese men. They're is some excellent visual imagery in the film and in one scene Jade and Mark are on swings and the shot is in slow motion with a good and effective musical score to enhance the visual flair. In another scene a fed up Jade gets out of the car of another date and starts to run down the street. We are not told where she is running to but we must assume its to Mark. Sandra Oh's performance seems to be flawless. Watching her character ultimately give up trying to please her father is just riveting to watch. I've always been a big fan of Oh's and I thought she was equally terrific in "Dancing at the Blue Iguana". Oh takes the character of Jade and makes her not only smart and strong, but makes her very human also! When a casting director asks her how could she possibly think of herself as Chinese if she cannot read it, Jade at this point in the film questions herself and ultimately comes to a life changing decision. Mina Shums script is sharp and she doesn't portray Jade's parents as one dimensional. They have issues as well and it affects the lives of their children. Well written script gives Oh the opportunity to give a totally convincing and haunting performance.

    This was a cute, sweet small movie about a Chinese-Canadian woman caught between her dreams and her father's expectations. Complaints about the film center on what some see as the director's one-sided depiction of the anti-assimilation viewpoint. Jade's father is so concerned that his children live within the constricts of traditional Chinese culture that he cuts off contact with them entirely if they stray. But Mina Shum (the director) never claims that his rigidity is the rule; the story is about how Jade deals with the specific situation, and it makes no claim that her situation is pervasive. Other Asian characters have different levels of acceptance of Western openness: Jade's mother, while not openly defying her husband, maintains contact with her son whom his father has cut off completely. So "Double Happiness" isn't an anti-Asian traditionalism screed, as some have claimed, neither is it an Everywoman story of freedom as some seem to want it to be. It's simply Jade's story about choosing between her dreams and the man she's falling in love with against her father's uncompromising worldview. Mechanically, the movie is good if not a masterpiece. The performances are excellent. Sandra Oh is charged with almost singlehandedly winning over the viewer, and she's completely up to the challenge. All performances are (as far as I can tell anyway) wonderfully authentic. This was Callum Keith Rennie's first major role, and he's as awkward, sweet, and appealing as ever. The interstitial scenes of characters speaking to the camera are an interesting experiment--a good tool for revealing character, they nevertheless are sometimes jarring. Overall, the film is like a compact colorful flower: it won't dominate the landscape but it richly awards the lucky soul whose attention it captures.

    "Double Happiness" is a very disappointing first feature from director Mina Shum. The characters thin, the writing lackluster, and the direction uninspired, this film received attention due to its "ethnic" subject matter at a number of festivals upon its release in 1995. "Double Happiness" garnered favorable reviews from a handful of critics who, in the progressive world of cinema and media arts, were probably reluctant to note the film's many flaws for fear of being labeled insensitive to Asian culture. (It was this critical attention that probably managed to secure the film limited distribution in North America.) However, despite a strong performance by newcomer Sandra Oh (HBO's "Arliss") and strong lensing, there's little to distinguish this empty comedy from the myriad of low budget features that, deservedly, never find an audience. There's little originality in "Double Happiness" and that's a shame. This reviewer won't give away any spoilers, but suffice it to say the story moves along at an expectable pace, and every story beat and and plot point comes in a paint-by-the numbers fashion. Jade Lee is the free-spririted, hip young woman in conflict with her traditional family. She must stand up for herself and seek her own identity. That's probably a compelling story but, in "Double Happiness," it's one not well told. Rather than portraying the character and theme through real development of character, conflict and emotion, we're given about 90 minutes stiff dialogue and forced drama/comedy. This story deserved better and so did the audience. A real shame indeed.

    Mina Shum's Double Happiness bravely explores a group that mainstream film (read: Hollywood) continues to ignore: Asians in North America. That the film features strong acting, good writing and confident direction makes its accomplishments all the more greater. You don't need to be Asian to enjoy this film, anymore than you have to be Italian to watch The Godfathers. Young women of whatever ethnic backgrounds are bound to identify with the lead character, finely played by Sandra Oh. The daughter-father conflict crosses all national boundaries, and is explored in this film through the eyes of Chinese-Canadians. I'm a Canadian of Chinese descent, and found the characterizations of the family to be accurate overall. At times, the domineering Father is one-dimensional (tyrannical and cold) and needed to be fleshed out more. The role of the siblings--especially towards their parents--was underplayed and could have offered a contrast to the main relationship between the elder daughter and Dad. Still, the strict traditionalism of the parents was on the nose, and the struggles of the daughter, Jade, ring true. In fact, I venture to say that Jade was played *too* obediently, and should have broken from her family sooner. Following this line of thought, the film could have been expanded to explore Jade moving into her own home and finding her own career as an actress, then reconciling (perhaps) with her stern Father at the end. As it stands, the movie ends abruptly and too soon. Shum and Oh do a fine job of getting Jade on the audience's side, only pull the carpet on her just as she leaves home. The movie begs for closure in the relationship between daughter and father. Perhaps in the sequel.

    This is an excellent movie portraying the struggle of any Asian child: personal goals over family expectations. Every one of us go through Jade's life and it's a very challenging goal. It's impossible to please yourself and please your family at the same time. As an Asian kid myself, I strongly advise for you to do whatever makes you happy.
