  The mega corporation Omni Consumer Products is still bent on creating their pet project, Delta City, to replace the rotting city of Detroit.

    This movie was just awful. The story was practically non existent. It felt like it was written by a group of 12 year olds who were bored and had no imagination. The script would have been better off if it had been turned into a TV episode. The acting was decidedly wooden in places although the actor who played Robocop wasn't to bad (could have been worse and could have been better). The whole movie is aimed at kids with all the gimmicky attachments for Robocop (flight pack and arm attachment) being nothing more than product placement for the tied in merchandising. Im giving this a 3 out of 10 because the only decent thing about the movie was the soundtrack.

    Vast improvement over the dreadful Part II, this still suffers from feeling watered-down, and overly kid-friendly, as Robocop returns to fight his own company again, who are ruthlessly trying to evict the citizens of Detroit to make a profit, and are trying to merge with a Japanese conglomerate, while at the same time stave off bankruptcy. Though there are some good action scenes, and its heart is in the right place, this feels tired, as if there was no sense of urgency or purpose behind it other than completing the story. A shame, because with a bit more story preparation, this could have been good, but feels rushed, though it sat on the shelf for two years! Does have a satisfying ending though.

    Robocop 3 is a brutal disaster,it is without a doubt the worst of the three Robocop's,and thats saying a lot comparing it to the also terrible Robocop 2.I thought the movie began promising,and I thought it seemed better than the second Robocop,but as soon as I saw Robert John Burke as Robocop I knew I was going to hate it,I never knew until I saw this that Peter Weller wasn't in it,and this guy was a terrible replacement,he made no effort to sound any bit similar to the original Robocop.Peter Weller was the only I liked about the second one,and thats what made this movie so terrible,at least they killed off Nancy Allen's character,I never liked her in it,her acting is amazingly terrible and was happy that she wasn't in this very much,but her acting for the beginning of the movie was probably even worse than she was in the first two.If you enjoyed the first Robocop,leave it at that,the sequels are both humiliating,their boring,predictable,too long and the cast are really uninspired,they made me question why I liked the first one.Do not bother with Robocop 2 or 3,trust me,even if you didn't see the first one and have nothing to compare it too,its still terrible. Robocop is completely fixed and takes on a large group that are looking to evict people from Detroit.

    The original Robocop, unless you're talking to fellow movie buffs like myself, is often seen as cheesy and over-the-top. In reality, the film is a pure "cult classic" if there ever was one. There are so many moral issues that flow subtly and neatly throughout the film, the violence is graphic and extreme-yet somewhat believable. The underlying comedic elements such as the TV commercials and newscasters are hilarious. The 2nd Robocop was good as well, although it fell more into the Hollywood tradition of trying too hard to do a sequel to match the first. A lot of the things I loved about 1 weren't in 2, but it was still good. Now we have 3. In every way it is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of the original and what Paul veerhoven set out to achieve with it. First off, PG-13? Cmon. The plot is filled with more bullet holes than the people that got shot up, Peter Weller isn't back and it shows, the acting is terrible, the action is terrible, not only is it by far the worst Robocop film ever, it is one THE worst films ever, period. A disgrace to what could have ended as an incredible franchise.

    I'll get right to the point with this one: I didn't give this movie a 1/10 because I got the chance to see the ED-209 again. I've always loved that robot. I thought it was so bad-ass when I first saw it. But the BS starts right after we see the ED-209, when that kid takes control of the droid with her computer toy made out of plastic. I mean is that computer toy something or what? It can hack into security cameras and broadcast videos all over the TV channels, it can hack into ED-209's memory, and the list goes on. There are so many things that don't add up in this movie. But the thing that most bothered me was robo's mouth. It looked like he was trying to take a number 2 throughout the whole movie. He looked horrible. Couldn't they have piked somebody else for the job? Everything about this movie is horrible. I didn't like anything I saw in it, the story is horrible and it stinks so bad it makes me wanna puke. Bottom line is... I won't even count it as one of the robocop movies because it doesn't deserve it. It's nothing but a pile of crap and it shouldn't belong on this planet.

    The OCP has now a powerful grip-lock on the city of Detroit. Along with their Japanese shareholders, even the Detroit Police Force is now under their jurisdiction as they are now working for them. With the Japanese shareholders they are in the process of destroying the already crumbling Detroit and transforming it into a more enhanced "Delta City". However liberal sewer dwellers who not going sit down and let this happen; they will revolt to any means necessary even if it means through violence and carnage. However, the OCP hires some "Rehab Teams" which are military police led by a menacing cyborg named McDaggett whose plan is to bring those who oppose the OCP and make them part of their justice. But the opposing liberals find a robot that will side with them. After the death of Officer Lewis (Nancy Allen), Robocop (Robert Burke) has become the defender of the rebels in their quest to win back their city and to take down the OCP of its own foundations. I'm sorry to say that this was the most unpleasant way to end the series. In fact they should have pulled the plug after the second instalment. Granted, the story had a lot of good things going for it, the script was the definitive Achilles Heel that really made the movie appalling, which also made the performances mediocre at best. The tone of violence was watered down badly as it went from an R rating in the first two instalments to a dismal PG-13 rating. Even the swearing was toned down gregariously as well. My guess was that the producers were trying to promote this film to a more broader audience. They went far as to have an animated version of "Robocop" as a way of making merchandise and if that's not enough to hurt a franchise, remember a few years ago Robocop invaded WCW wrestling and came to the aid of Sting (Steve Borden), that was pure ludicrous (Who remembers "Capitol Combat 90: The Return of Robocop") This is the worst thing since Rick Steiner having a verbal spat with Chucky from "Child's Play". Another factor that hurt the series was its frugal budget. The first movie you could not go wrong with the special effects. And the violence was gritty and effective as the bullets were aimed to perfection. The acting overall was a letdown too as the only character with spark (pun intended) was Robert Burke who filled in for Peter Weller as the heroic Police bot. With the new characters, the development was absent in this instalment. If you are curious and would like to see it I'm not stopping you. It's still enjoyable, but not very memorable.

    RoboCop's cinema outings come to an ignominious halt with this trashy, clueless sequel. Apparently mistaking the original film's black humour for knockabout comedy, director Fred Dekker slapsticks the character through a plot involving a ninja robot and a kiddie sidekick. Even the Media Breaks are used for cheap laughs; well, everything is cheap. Returning characters are shadows of their former selves, while new RoboCop Robert John Burke waddles around in Peter Weller's cast-offs like he's shat his pants. Come the end he's a poorly-bluescreened jetpack pilot in a sequence that not only reduces the character to a cartoonish parody but also transforms him into an action figure. Dekker's direction is apathetic, the villains are cartoons, the action is flat,the visual effects are dire and there isn't a single moment that doesn't fail in some way. This is a stupid, incompetent, unfunny, soulless junker, a travesty of the original movie.

    'Robocop 3' is a real turkey that for the most part deserves it's putrid reputation as one of the worst sequels of all time. It's a movie that offends me really more for the thought process behind it and for the aftermath it had on the career of director Fred Dekker. The film suffers because it has a violent tonal difference from it's far superior predecessors and any fan of those films is bound to be offended here. 'Robocop 3' is made solely for children because Orion thought they could sell toys. It's a kind of offensively ironic thought really because 'Robocop' is a movie that blatantly is about commercialism stealing the soul. I think as it's own piece 'Robocop 3' is merely a forgettable action film but as a sequel it is a slap in the face to the mythology and the fans. 'Robocop 3' feels as though you can feel Orion breath down the neck of the film. It is a children's film and it's a children's film in the worst possible way. It plays as if it thinks kids are stupid. This is a quintessential flaw, children are intelligent especially with adventure films. Why are films like 'Star Wars' or 'Superman' so brilliant at capturing the imagination of children and adults alike? Because they take time to develop a mythology and characters that are engrossing and spark the imagination. 'Robocop 3' is a sequel to two very adult films that have a mythology that deals with very adult themes that are beyond children's capacities. Gone completely in 'Robocop 3' is the violent anti-capitalist satire but even more important is the themes of losing one's humanity. Alex Murphy does not want to be Robocop. Robocop is a perversion of the laws of life and death and the first film is an exploration of what it is to be human. Sure Robocop looks cool but the aesthetics hide a troubled soul seeking to reclaim it's self. 'Robocop 3' is all about celebrating the cool looking aesthetics because they sell toys and not caring about what lie underneath. There is some aspects of the Alex Murphy resurrection story trying to fight their way to the surface here but they are ruined by the fact that this film can't play with them because they might scare children and so instead we get rock'em sock 'em jetpacks. 'Robocop 3' probably shouldn't have been made. There really wasn't anything left to tell in the story. That being said I think Dekker and crew had the foundations upon which to build something had they not been told to make a children's films. I like the idea of an armed resistance finally fighting OCP because it is very much a natural endpoint to what Verhoven set up in the original. The problem is that in order to do this story right you have to go into some radical leftist territory that doesn't sell tickets or toys. Fred Dekker takes a great deal of criticism for the film's failure and I don't think that is particularly fair. If anything this film is above a bomb rating because Dekker can effectively stage really brilliant action sequences. I think 'Robocop 3' could have been a lot of fun had they given Dekker complete creative control. 'Night of the Creeps' is a very funny and visually fun gory horror film and a 'Robocop 3' made in those lines would have been an effective fun end to the trilogy. I like the action scenes provided that some of the stupid dialogue is taken away. The film is just a mess and a missed opportunity. I like to think that somehow this film could have been good and Fred Dekker would get the respect he deserves and that this great series would have had a proper ending. The problem is you can see a film company perverting something profound in order to make money. Orion was kind of like OCP in that regard...

    This third installment of Robocop in my opinion is the finest of the trilogy, because it hits home in the most accurate way predicting the future. Detroit is now a police state owned by a private corporation OCP. Everything is now the property of OCP including the private residence of an individual, and if you resist eviction, police will come in with a wrecking ball, and full military assault weapons. Humans are reduced to property as well, and anyone who fall out of the system, and resist the tyranny of OCP and the police is labeled "Terrorists". This is extremely close to the current situation of our country in that over half a million foreign troops are in United States because the US military has refused to shoot at American citizens. One executive order from the president can declare martial law, suspend constitution and privatize communication, transportation including cars, and property. It's amazing that this movie accurately predicted the future of the country 20 to 30 years before its time, and excites me to watch the take the producers had at the time the movie was made. The movie is well made, and contains irony as well as humor in the mix. For these reasons, this Robocop movie is the best of the three that's made for me.

    Although this final installment of Robocop doesn't measure up to the original 1987 masterpiece, or even the 1990 sequel, I've got a special place for it in my heart. That would be the "wtf did I just watch" chamber. If you remember the old 80s TV action shows... like "The A-Team", "Spenser: For Hire", "MacGyver", etc... you're halfway there. These were shows that didn't have a lot of substance but were fun to watch anyway. The plots were mostly predictable and the execution was corny, but that's precisely why we watch them. Robocop 3 is an unusual return to that style (whether by design or not). Plot is linear, scenes are bright, dialogue is snippy but not particularly witty, and dramatic/disturbing scenes are glossed over, almost as if it's made for a PG-13 audience (WHOA, I just realized this IS PG-13... while the first 2 films were rated R). Yet the film also injects spots of extreme violence and creepy dark humor... like the 2 or 3 "comedic" scenes of people committing suicide, which did make me laugh out loud, I admit. Those were the scenes I liked best because they remained true to the original dark satire of the original Robocop. I still don't view the Robocop trilogy as an action story but rather a brilliant dark comedy. Robocop 3 has the same bizarre news briefs and hilarious commercials peppered throughout, and although it's not as thick as in the original, the vibe is still there. But the overall feeling is one of campy 80s. Check out the hilarious 80s hairstyles & clothes (denim jackets... dear lord I thought we burned all of them!). Really bizarre. If the director intended it to be deliberately ironic, he's a freakin genius.

'Robocop 3' feels as though you can feel Orion breath down the neck of the film. It is a children's film and it's a children's film in the worst possible way. It plays as if it thinks kids are stupid. This is a quintessential flaw, children are intelligent especially with adventure films. Why are films like 'Star Wars' or 'Superman' so brilliant at capturing the imagination of children and adults alike? Because they take time to develop a mythology and characters that are engrossing and spark the imagination. 'Robocop 3' is a sequel to two very adult films that have a mythology that deals with very adult themes that are beyond children's capacities. Gone completely in 'Robocop 3' is the violent anti-capitalist satire but even more important is the themes of losing one's humanity. Alex Murphy does not want to be Robocop. Robocop is a perversion of the laws of life and death and the first film is an exploration of what it is to be human. Sure Robocop looks cool but the aesthetics hide a troubled soul seeking to reclaim it's self. 'Robocop 3' is all about celebrating the cool looking aesthetics because they sell toys and not caring about what lie underneath. There is some aspects of the Alex Murphy resurrection story trying to fight their way to the surface here but they are ruined by the fact that this film can't play with them because they might scare children and so instead we get rock'em sock 'em jetpacks. 'Robocop 3' probably shouldn't have been made. There really wasn't anything left to tell in the story. That being said I think Dekker and crew had the foundations upon which to build something had they not been told to make a children's films. I like the idea of an armed resistance finally fighting OCP because it is very much a natural endpoint to what Verhoven set up in the original. The problem is that in order to do this story right you have to go into some radical leftist territory that doesn't sell tickets or toys. Fred Dekker takes a great deal of criticism for the film's failure and I don't think that is particularly fair. If anything this film is above a bomb rating because Dekker can effectively stage really brilliant action sequences. I think 'Robocop 3' could have been a lot of fun had they given Dekker complete creative control. 'Night of the Creeps' is a very funny and visually fun gory horror film and a 'Robocop 3' made in those lines would have been an effective fun end to the trilogy. I like the action scenes provided that some of the stupid dialogue is taken away. The film is just a mess and a missed opportunity. I like to think that somehow this film could have been good and Fred Dekker would get the respect he deserves and that this great series would have had a proper ending. The problem is you can see a film company perverting something profound in order to make money. Orion was kind of like OCP in that regard...

    This third installment of Robocop in my opinion is the finest of the trilogy, because it hits home in the most accurate way predicting the future. Detroit is now a police state owned by a private corporation OCP. Everything is now the property of OCP including the private residence of an individual, and if you resist eviction, police will come in with a wrecking ball, and full military assault weapons. Humans are reduced to property as well, and anyone who fall out of the system, and resist the tyranny of OCP and the police is labeled "Terrorists". This is extremely close to the current situation of our country in that over half a million foreign troops are in United States because the US military has refused to shoot at American citizens. One executive order from the president can declare martial law, suspend constitution and privatize communication, transportation including cars, and property. It's amazing that this movie accurately predicted the future of the country 20 to 30 years before its time, and excites me to watch the take the producers had at the time the movie was made. The movie is well made, and contains irony as well as humor in the mix. For these reasons, this Robocop movie is the best of the three that's made for me.

    Although this final installment of Robocop doesn't measure up to the original 1987 masterpiece, or even the 1990 sequel, I've got a special place for it in my heart. That would be the "wtf did I just watch" chamber. If you remember the old 80s TV action shows... like "The A-Team", "Spenser: For Hire", "MacGyver", etc... you're halfway there. These were shows that didn't have a lot of substance but were fun to watch anyway. The plots were mostly predictable and the execution was corny, but that's precisely why we watch them. Robocop 3 is an unusual return to that style (whether by design or not). Plot is linear, scenes are bright, dialogue is snippy but not particularly witty, and dramatic/disturbing scenes are glossed over, almost as if it's made for a PG-13 audience (WHOA, I just realized this IS PG-13... while the first 2 films were rated R). Yet the film also injects spots of extreme violence and creepy dark humor... like the 2 or 3 "comedic" scenes of people committing suicide, which did make me laugh out loud, I admit. Those were the scenes I liked best because they remained true to the original dark satire of the original Robocop. I still don't view the Robocop trilogy as an action story but rather a brilliant dark comedy. Robocop 3 has the same bizarre news briefs and hilarious commercials peppered throughout, and although it's not as thick as in the original, the vibe is still there. But the overall feeling is one of campy 80s. Check out the hilarious 80s hairstyles & clothes (denim jackets... dear lord I thought we burned all of them!). Really bizarre. If the director intended it to be deliberately ironic, he's a freakin genius.

    This movie was just awful. The story was practically non existent. It felt like it was written by a group of 12 year olds who were bored and had no imagination. The script would have been better off if it had been turned into a TV episode. The acting was decidedly wooden in places although the actor who played Robocop wasn't to bad (could have been worse and could have been better). The whole movie is aimed at kids with all the gimmicky attachments for Robocop (flight pack and arm attachment) being nothing more than product placement for the tied in merchandising. Im giving this a 3 out of 10 because the only decent thing about the movie was the soundtrack.

    Vast improvement over the dreadful Part II, this still suffers from feeling watered-down, and overly kid-friendly, as Robocop returns to fight his own company again, who are ruthlessly trying to evict the citizens of Detroit to make a profit, and are trying to merge with a Japanese conglomerate, while at the same time stave off bankruptcy. Though there are some good action scenes, and its heart is in the right place, this feels tired, as if there was no sense of urgency or purpose behind it other than completing the story. A shame, because with a bit more story preparation, this could have been good, but feels rushed, though it sat on the shelf for two years! Does have a satisfying ending though.

    Robocop 3 is a brutal disaster,it is without a doubt the worst of the three Robocop's,and thats saying a lot comparing it to the also terrible Robocop 2.I thought the movie began promising,and I thought it seemed better than the second Robocop,but as soon as I saw Robert John Burke as Robocop I knew I was going to hate it,I never knew until I saw this that Peter Weller wasn't in it,and this guy was a terrible replacement,he made no effort to sound any bit similar to the original Robocop.Peter Weller was the only I liked about the second one,and thats what made this movie so terrible,at least they killed off Nancy Allen's character,I never liked her in it,her acting is amazingly terrible and was happy that she wasn't in this very much,but her acting for the beginning of the movie was probably even worse than she was in the first two.If you enjoyed the first Robocop,leave it at that,the sequels are both humiliating,their boring,predictable,too long and the cast are really uninspired,they made me question why I liked the first one.Do not bother with Robocop 2 or 3,trust me,even if you didn't see the first one and have nothing to compare it too,its still terrible. Robocop is completely fixed and takes on a large group that are looking to evict people from Detroit.

    The original Robocop, unless you're talking to fellow movie buffs like myself, is often seen as cheesy and over-the-top. In reality, the film is a pure "cult classic" if there ever was one. There are so many moral issues that flow subtly and neatly throughout the film, the violence is graphic and extreme-yet somewhat believable. The underlying comedic elements such as the TV commercials and newscasters are hilarious. The 2nd Robocop was good as well, although it fell more into the Hollywood tradition of trying too hard to do a sequel to match the first. A lot of the things I loved about 1 weren't in 2, but it was still good. Now we have 3. In every way it is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of the original and what Paul veerhoven set out to achieve with it. First off, PG-13? Cmon. The plot is filled with more bullet holes than the people that got shot up, Peter Weller isn't back and it shows, the acting is terrible, the action is terrible, not only is it by far the worst Robocop film ever, it is one THE worst films ever, period. A disgrace to what could have ended as an incredible franchise.

    I'll get right to the point with this one: I didn't give this movie a 1/10 because I got the chance to see the ED-209 again. I've always loved that robot. I thought it was so bad-ass when I first saw it. But the BS starts right after we see the ED-209, when that kid takes control of the droid with her computer toy made out of plastic. I mean is that computer toy something or what? It can hack into security cameras and broadcast videos all over the TV channels, it can hack into ED-209's memory, and the list goes on. There are so many things that don't add up in this movie. But the thing that most bothered me was robo's mouth. It looked like he was trying to take a number 2 throughout the whole movie. He looked horrible. Couldn't they have piked somebody else for the job? Everything about this movie is horrible. I didn't like anything I saw in it, the story is horrible and it stinks so bad it makes me wanna puke. Bottom line is... I won't even count it as one of the robocop movies because it doesn't deserve it. It's nothing but a pile of crap and it shouldn't belong on this planet.

    The OCP has now a powerful grip-lock on the city of Detroit. Along with their Japanese shareholders, even the Detroit Police Force is now under their jurisdiction as they are now working for them. With the Japanese shareholders they are in the process of destroying the already crumbling Detroit and transforming it into a more enhanced "Delta City". However liberal sewer dwellers who not going sit down and let this happen; they will revolt to any means necessary even if it means through violence and carnage. However, the OCP hires some "Rehab Teams" which are military police led by a menacing cyborg named McDaggett whose plan is to bring those who oppose the OCP and make them part of their justice. But the opposing liberals find a robot that will side with them. After the death of Officer Lewis (Nancy Allen), Robocop (Robert Burke) has become the defender of the rebels in their quest to win back their city and to take down the OCP of its own foundations. I'm sorry to say that this was the most unpleasant way to end the series. In fact they should have pulled the plug after the second instalment. Granted, the story had a lot of good things going for it, the script was the definitive Achilles Heel that really made the movie appalling, which also made the performances mediocre at best. The tone of violence was watered down badly as it went from an R rating in the first two instalments to a dismal PG-13 rating. Even the swearing was toned down gregariously as well. My guess was that the producers were trying to promote this film to a more broader audience. They went far as to have an animated version of "Robocop" as a way of making merchandise and if that's not enough to hurt a franchise, remember a few years ago Robocop invaded WCW wrestling and came to the aid of Sting (Steve Borden), that was pure ludicrous (Who remembers "Capitol Combat 90: The Return of Robocop") This is the worst thing since Rick Steiner having a verbal spat with Chucky from "Child's Play". Another factor that hurt the series was its frugal budget. The first movie you could not go wrong with the special effects. And the violence was gritty and effective as the bullets were aimed to perfection. The acting overall was a letdown too as the only character with spark (pun intended) was Robert Burke who filled in for Peter Weller as the heroic Police bot. With the new characters, the development was absent in this instalment. If you are curious and would like to see it I'm not stopping you. It's still enjoyable, but not very memorable.

    RoboCop's cinema outings come to an ignominious halt with this trashy, clueless sequel. Apparently mistaking the original film's black humour for knockabout comedy, director Fred Dekker slapsticks the character through a plot involving a ninja robot and a kiddie sidekick. Even the Media Breaks are used for cheap laughs; well, everything is cheap. Returning characters are shadows of their former selves, while new RoboCop Robert John Burke waddles around in Peter Weller's cast-offs like he's shat his pants. Come the end he's a poorly-bluescreened jetpack pilot in a sequence that not only reduces the character to a cartoonish parody but also transforms him into an action figure. Dekker's direction is apathetic, the villains are cartoons, the action is flat,the visual effects are dire and there isn't a single moment that doesn't fail in some way. This is a stupid, incompetent, unfunny, soulless junker, a travesty of the original movie.

    'Robocop 3' is a real turkey that for the most part deserves it's putrid reputation as one of the worst sequels of all time. It's a movie that offends me really more for the thought process behind it and for the aftermath it had on the career of director Fred Dekker. The film suffers because it has a violent tonal difference from it's far superior predecessors and any fan of those films is bound to be offended here. 'Robocop 3' is made solely for children because Orion thought they could sell toys. It's a kind of offensively ironic thought really because 'Robocop' is a movie that blatantly is about commercialism stealing the soul. I think as it's own piece 'Robocop 3' is merely a forgettable action film but as a sequel it is a slap in the face to the mythology and the fans. 'Robocop 3' feels as though you can feel Orion breath down the neck of the film. It is a children's film and it's a children's film in the worst possible way. It plays as if it thinks kids are stupid. This is a quintessential flaw, children are intelligent especially with adventure films. Why are films like 'Star Wars' or 'Superman' so brilliant at capturing the imagination of children and adults alike?

However, the OCP hires some "Rehab Teams" which are military police led by a menacing cyborg named McDaggett whose plan is to bring those who oppose the OCP and make them part of their justice. But the opposing liberals find a robot that will side with them. After the death of Officer Lewis (Nancy Allen), Robocop (Robert Burke) has become the defender of the rebels in their quest to win back their city and to take down the OCP of its own foundations. I'm sorry to say that this was the most unpleasant way to end the series. In fact they should have pulled the plug after the second instalment. Granted, the story had a lot of good things going for it, the script was the definitive Achilles Heel that really made the movie appalling, which also made the performances mediocre at best. The tone of violence was watered down badly as it went from an R rating in the first two instalments to a dismal PG-13 rating. Even the swearing was toned down gregariously as well. My guess was that the producers were trying to promote this film to a more broader audience. They went far as to have an animated version of "Robocop" as a way of making merchandise and if that's not enough to hurt a franchise, remember a few years ago Robocop invaded WCW wrestling and came to the aid of Sting (Steve Borden), that was pure ludicrous (Who remembers "Capitol Combat 90: The Return of Robocop") This is the worst thing since Rick Steiner having a verbal spat with Chucky from "Child's Play". Another factor that hurt the series was its frugal budget. The first movie you could not go wrong with the special effects. And the violence was gritty and effective as the bullets were aimed to perfection. The acting overall was a letdown too as the only character with spark (pun intended) was Robert Burke who filled in for Peter Weller as the heroic Police bot. With the new characters, the development was absent in this instalment. If you are curious and would like to see it I'm not stopping you. It's still enjoyable, but not very memorable.

    RoboCop's cinema outings come to an ignominious halt with this trashy, clueless sequel. Apparently mistaking the original film's black humour for knockabout comedy, director Fred Dekker slapsticks the character through a plot involving a ninja robot and a kiddie sidekick. Even the Media Breaks are used for cheap laughs; well, everything is cheap. Returning characters are shadows of their former selves, while new RoboCop Robert John Burke waddles around in Peter Weller's cast-offs like he's shat his pants. Come the end he's a poorly-bluescreened jetpack pilot in a sequence that not only reduces the character to a cartoonish parody but also transforms him into an action figure. Dekker's direction is apathetic, the villains are cartoons, the action is flat,the visual effects are dire and there isn't a single moment that doesn't fail in some way. This is a stupid, incompetent, unfunny, soulless junker, a travesty of the original movie.

    'Robocop 3' is a real turkey that for the most part deserves it's putrid reputation as one of the worst sequels of all time. It's a movie that offends me really more for the thought process behind it and for the aftermath it had on the career of director Fred Dekker. The film suffers because it has a violent tonal difference from it's far superior predecessors and any fan of those films is bound to be offended here. 'Robocop 3' is made solely for children because Orion thought they could sell toys. It's a kind of offensively ironic thought really because 'Robocop' is a movie that blatantly is about commercialism stealing the soul. I think as it's own piece 'Robocop 3' is merely a forgettable action film but as a sequel it is a slap in the face to the mythology and the fans. 'Robocop 3' feels as though you can feel Orion breath down the neck of the film. It is a children's film and it's a children's film in the worst possible way. It plays as if it thinks kids are stupid. This is a quintessential flaw, children are intelligent especially with adventure films. Why are films like 'Star Wars' or 'Superman' so brilliant at capturing the imagination of children and adults alike? Because they take time to develop a mythology and characters that are engrossing and spark the imagination. 'Robocop 3' is a sequel to two very adult films that have a mythology that deals with very adult themes that are beyond children's capacities. Gone completely in 'Robocop 3' is the violent anti-capitalist satire but even more important is the themes of losing one's humanity. Alex Murphy does not want to be Robocop. Robocop is a perversion of the laws of life and death and the first film is an exploration of what it is to be human. Sure Robocop looks cool but the aesthetics hide a troubled soul seeking to reclaim it's self. 'Robocop 3' is all about celebrating the cool looking aesthetics because they sell toys and not caring about what lie underneath. There is some aspects of the Alex Murphy resurrection story trying to fight their way to the surface here but they are ruined by the fact that this film can't play with them because they might scare children and so instead we get rock'em sock 'em jetpacks. 'Robocop 3' probably shouldn't have been made. There really wasn't anything left to tell in the story. That being said I think Dekker and crew had the foundations upon which to build something had they not been told to make a children's films. I like the idea of an armed resistance finally fighting OCP because it is very much a natural endpoint to what Verhoven set up in the original. The problem is that in order to do this story right you have to go into some radical leftist territory that doesn't sell tickets or toys. Fred Dekker takes a great deal of criticism for the film's failure and I don't think that is particularly fair. If anything this film is above a bomb rating because Dekker can effectively stage really brilliant action sequences. I think 'Robocop 3' could have been a lot of fun had they given Dekker complete creative control. 'Night of the Creeps' is a very funny and visually fun gory horror film and a 'Robocop 3' made in those lines would have been an effective fun end to the trilogy. I like the action scenes provided that some of the stupid dialogue is taken away. The film is just a mess and a missed opportunity. I like to think that somehow this film could have been good and Fred Dekker would get the respect he deserves and that this great series would have had a proper ending. The problem is you can see a film company perverting something profound in order to make money. Orion was kind of like OCP in that regard...

    This third installment of Robocop in my opinion is the finest of the trilogy, because it hits home in the most accurate way predicting the future. Detroit is now a police state owned by a private corporation OCP. Everything is now the property of OCP including the private residence of an individual, and if you resist eviction, police will come in with a wrecking ball, and full military assault weapons. Humans are reduced to property as well, and anyone who fall out of the system, and resist the tyranny of OCP and the police is labeled "Terrorists". This is extremely close to the current situation of our country in that over half a million foreign troops are in United States because the US military has refused to shoot at American citizens. One executive order from the president can declare martial law, suspend constitution and privatize communication, transportation including cars, and property. It's amazing that this movie accurately predicted the future of the country 20 to 30 years before its time, and excites me to watch the take the producers had at the time the movie was made. The movie is well made, and contains irony as well as humor in the mix. For these reasons, this Robocop movie is the best of the three that's made for me.

    Although this final installment of Robocop doesn't measure up to the original 1987 masterpiece, or even the 1990 sequel, I've got a special place for it in my heart. That would be the "wtf did I just watch" chamber. If you remember the old 80s TV action shows... like "The A-Team", "Spenser: For Hire", "MacGyver", etc... you're halfway there. These were shows that didn't have a lot of substance but were fun to watch anyway. The plots were mostly predictable and the execution was corny, but that's precisely why we watch them. Robocop 3 is an unusual return to that style (whether by design or not). Plot is linear, scenes are bright, dialogue is snippy but not particularly witty, and dramatic/disturbing scenes are glossed over, almost as if it's made for a PG-13 audience (WHOA, I just realized this IS PG-13... while the first 2 films were rated R). Yet the film also injects spots of extreme violence and creepy dark humor... like the 2 or 3 "comedic" scenes of people committing suicide, which did make me laugh out loud, I admit. Those were the scenes I liked best because they remained true to the original dark satire of the original Robocop. I still don't view the Robocop trilogy as an action story but rather a brilliant dark comedy. Robocop 3 has the same bizarre news briefs and hilarious commercials peppered throughout, and although it's not as thick as in the original, the vibe is still there. But the overall feeling is one of campy 80s. Check out the hilarious 80s hairstyles & clothes (denim jackets... dear lord I thought we burned all of them!). Really bizarre. If the director intended it to be deliberately ironic, he's a freakin genius.

    This movie was just awful. The story was practically non existent. It felt like it was written by a group of 12 year olds who were bored and had no imagination. The script would have been better off if it had been turned into a TV episode. The acting was decidedly wooden in places although the actor who played Robocop wasn't to bad (could have been worse and could have been better). The whole movie is aimed at kids with all the gimmicky attachments for Robocop (flight pack and arm attachment) being nothing more than product placement for the tied in merchandising. Im giving this a 3 out of 10 because the only decent thing about the movie was the soundtrack.

    Vast improvement over the dreadful Part II, this still suffers from feeling watered-down, and overly kid-friendly, as Robocop returns to fight his own company again, who are ruthlessly trying to evict the citizens of Detroit to make a profit, and are trying to merge with a Japanese conglomerate, while at the same time stave off bankruptcy. Though there are some good action scenes, and its heart is in the right place, this feels tired, as if there was no sense of urgency or purpose behind it other than completing the story. A shame, because with a bit more story preparation, this could have been good, but feels rushed, though it sat on the shelf for two years! Does have a satisfying ending though.

    Robocop 3 is a brutal disaster,it is without a doubt the worst of the three Robocop's,and thats saying a lot comparing it to the also terrible Robocop 2.I thought the movie began promising,and I thought it seemed better than the second Robocop,but as soon as I saw Robert John Burke as Robocop I knew I was going to hate it,I never knew until I saw this that Peter Weller wasn't in it,and this guy was a terrible replacement,he made no effort to sound any bit similar to the original Robocop.Peter Weller was the only I liked about the second one,and thats what made this movie so terrible,at least they killed off Nancy Allen's character,I never liked her in it,her acting is amazingly terrible and was happy that she wasn't in this very much,but her acting for the beginning of the movie was probably even worse than she was in the first two.If you enjoyed the first Robocop,leave it at that,the sequels are both humiliating,their boring,predictable,too long and the cast are really uninspired,they made me question why I liked the first one.Do not bother with Robocop 2 or 3,trust me,even if you didn't see the first one and have nothing to compare it too,its still terrible. Robocop is completely fixed and takes on a large group that are looking to evict people from Detroit.

    The original Robocop, unless you're talking to fellow movie buffs like myself, is often seen as cheesy and over-the-top. In reality, the film is a pure "cult classic" if there ever was one. There are so many moral issues that flow subtly and neatly throughout the film, the violence is graphic and extreme-yet somewhat believable. The underlying comedic elements such as the TV commercials and newscasters are hilarious. The 2nd Robocop was good as well, although it fell more into the Hollywood tradition of trying too hard to do a sequel to match the first. A lot of the things I loved about 1 weren't in 2, but it was still good. Now we have 3. In every way it is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of the original and what Paul veerhoven set out to achieve with it. First off, PG-13? Cmon. The plot is filled with more bullet holes than the people that got shot up, Peter Weller isn't back and it shows, the acting is terrible, the action is terrible, not only is it by far the worst Robocop film ever, it is one THE worst films ever, period. A disgrace to what could have ended as an incredible franchise.

    I'll get right to the point with this one: I didn't give this movie a 1/10 because I got the chance to see the ED-209 again. I've always loved that robot. I thought it was so bad-ass when I first saw it. But the BS starts right after we see the ED-209, when that kid takes control of the droid with her computer toy made out of plastic. I mean is that computer toy something or what? It can hack into security cameras and broadcast videos all over the TV channels, it can hack into ED-209's memory, and the list goes on. There are so many things that don't add up in this movie. But the thing that most bothered me was robo's mouth. It looked like he was trying to take a number 2 throughout the whole movie. He looked horrible. Couldn't they have piked somebody else for the job? Everything about this movie is horrible. I didn't like anything I saw in it, the story is horrible and it stinks so bad it makes me wanna puke. Bottom line is... I won't even count it as one of the robocop movies because it doesn't deserve it. It's nothing but a pile of crap and it shouldn't belong on this planet.

    The OCP has now a powerful grip-lock on the city of Detroit. Along with their Japanese shareholders, even the Detroit Police Force is now under their jurisdiction as they are now working for them. With the Japanese shareholders they are in the process of destroying the already crumbling Detroit and transforming it into a more enhanced "Delta City". However liberal sewer dwellers who not going sit down and let this happen; they will revolt to any means necessary even if it means through violence and carnage. However, the OCP hires some "Rehab Teams" which are military police led by a menacing cyborg named McDaggett whose plan is to bring those who oppose the OCP and make them part of their justice.

    Robocop 3 is a brutal disaster,it is without a doubt the worst of the three Robocop's,and thats saying a lot comparing it to the also terrible Robocop 2.I thought the movie began promising,and I thought it seemed better than the second Robocop,but as soon as I saw Robert John Burke as Robocop I knew I was going to hate it,I never knew until I saw this that Peter Weller wasn't in it,and this guy was a terrible replacement,he made no effort to sound any bit similar to the original Robocop.Peter Weller was the only I liked about the second one,and thats what made this movie so terrible,at least they killed off Nancy Allen's character,I never liked her in it,her acting is amazingly terrible and was happy that she wasn't in this very much,but her acting for the beginning of the movie was probably even worse than she was in the first two.If you enjoyed the first Robocop,leave it at that,the sequels are both humiliating,their boring,predictable,too long and the cast are really uninspired,they made me question why I liked the first one.Do not bother with Robocop 2 or 3,trust me,even if you didn't see the first one and have nothing to compare it too,its still terrible. Robocop is completely fixed and takes on a large group that are looking to evict people from Detroit.

    The original Robocop, unless you're talking to fellow movie buffs like myself, is often seen as cheesy and over-the-top. In reality, the film is a pure "cult classic" if there ever was one. There are so many moral issues that flow subtly and neatly throughout the film, the violence is graphic and extreme-yet somewhat believable. The underlying comedic elements such as the TV commercials and newscasters are hilarious. The 2nd Robocop was good as well, although it fell more into the Hollywood tradition of trying too hard to do a sequel to match the first. A lot of the things I loved about 1 weren't in 2, but it was still good. Now we have 3. In every way it is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of the original and what Paul veerhoven set out to achieve with it. First off, PG-13? Cmon. The plot is filled with more bullet holes than the people that got shot up, Peter Weller isn't back and it shows, the acting is terrible, the action is terrible, not only is it by far the worst Robocop film ever, it is one THE worst films ever, period. A disgrace to what could have ended as an incredible franchise.

    I'll get right to the point with this one: I didn't give this movie a 1/10 because I got the chance to see the ED-209 again. I've always loved that robot. I thought it was so bad-ass when I first saw it. But the BS starts right after we see the ED-209, when that kid takes control of the droid with her computer toy made out of plastic. I mean is that computer toy something or what? It can hack into security cameras and broadcast videos all over the TV channels, it can hack into ED-209's memory, and the list goes on. There are so many things that don't add up in this movie. But the thing that most bothered me was robo's mouth. It looked like he was trying to take a number 2 throughout the whole movie. He looked horrible. Couldn't they have piked somebody else for the job? Everything about this movie is horrible. I didn't like anything I saw in it, the story is horrible and it stinks so bad it makes me wanna puke. Bottom line is... I won't even count it as one of the robocop movies because it doesn't deserve it. It's nothing but a pile of crap and it shouldn't belong on this planet.

    The OCP has now a powerful grip-lock on the city of Detroit. Along with their Japanese shareholders, even the Detroit Police Force is now under their jurisdiction as they are now working for them. With the Japanese shareholders they are in the process of destroying the already crumbling Detroit and transforming it into a more enhanced "Delta City". However liberal sewer dwellers who not going sit down and let this happen; they will revolt to any means necessary even if it means through violence and carnage. However, the OCP hires some "Rehab Teams" which are military police led by a menacing cyborg named McDaggett whose plan is to bring those who oppose the OCP and make them part of their justice. But the opposing liberals find a robot that will side with them. After the death of Officer Lewis (Nancy Allen), Robocop (Robert Burke) has become the defender of the rebels in their quest to win back their city and to take down the OCP of its own foundations. I'm sorry to say that this was the most unpleasant way to end the series. In fact they should have pulled the plug after the second instalment. Granted, the story had a lot of good things going for it, the script was the definitive Achilles Heel that really made the movie appalling, which also made the performances mediocre at best. The tone of violence was watered down badly as it went from an R rating in the first two instalments to a dismal PG-13 rating. Even the swearing was toned down gregariously as well. My guess was that the producers were trying to promote this film to a more broader audience. They went far as to have an animated version of "Robocop" as a way of making merchandise and if that's not enough to hurt a franchise, remember a few years ago Robocop invaded WCW wrestling and came to the aid of Sting (Steve Borden), that was pure ludicrous (Who remembers "Capitol Combat 90: The Return of Robocop") This is the worst thing since Rick Steiner having a verbal spat with Chucky from "Child's Play". Another factor that hurt the series was its frugal budget. The first movie you could not go wrong with the special effects. And the violence was gritty and effective as the bullets were aimed to perfection. The acting overall was a letdown too as the only character with spark (pun intended) was Robert Burke who filled in for Peter Weller as the heroic Police bot. With the new characters, the development was absent in this instalment. If you are curious and would like to see it I'm not stopping you. It's still enjoyable, but not very memorable.

    RoboCop's cinema outings come to an ignominious halt with this trashy, clueless sequel. Apparently mistaking the original film's black humour for knockabout comedy, director Fred Dekker slapsticks the character through a plot involving a ninja robot and a kiddie sidekick. Even the Media Breaks are used for cheap laughs; well, everything is cheap. Returning characters are shadows of their former selves, while new RoboCop Robert John Burke waddles around in Peter Weller's cast-offs like he's shat his pants. Come the end he's a poorly-bluescreened jetpack pilot in a sequence that not only reduces the character to a cartoonish parody but also transforms him into an action figure. Dekker's direction is apathetic, the villains are cartoons, the action is flat,the visual effects are dire and there isn't a single moment that doesn't fail in some way. This is a stupid, incompetent, unfunny, soulless junker, a travesty of the original movie.

    'Robocop 3' is a real turkey that for the most part deserves it's putrid reputation as one of the worst sequels of all time. It's a movie that offends me really more for the thought process behind it and for the aftermath it had on the career of director Fred Dekker. The film suffers because it has a violent tonal difference from it's far superior predecessors and any fan of those films is bound to be offended here. 'Robocop 3' is made solely for children because Orion thought they could sell toys. It's a kind of offensively ironic thought really because 'Robocop' is a movie that blatantly is about commercialism stealing the soul. I think as it's own piece 'Robocop 3' is merely a forgettable action film but as a sequel it is a slap in the face to the mythology and the fans. 'Robocop 3' feels as though you can feel Orion breath down the neck of the film. It is a children's film and it's a children's film in the worst possible way. It plays as if it thinks kids are stupid. This is a quintessential flaw, children are intelligent especially with adventure films. Why are films like 'Star Wars' or 'Superman' so brilliant at capturing the imagination of children and adults alike? Because they take time to develop a mythology and characters that are engrossing and spark the imagination. 'Robocop 3' is a sequel to two very adult films that have a mythology that deals with very adult themes that are beyond children's capacities. Gone completely in 'Robocop 3' is the violent anti-capitalist satire but even more important is the themes of losing one's humanity. Alex Murphy does not want to be Robocop. Robocop is a perversion of the laws of life and death and the first film is an exploration of what it is to be human. Sure Robocop looks cool but the aesthetics hide a troubled soul seeking to reclaim it's self. 'Robocop 3' is all about celebrating the cool looking aesthetics because they sell toys and not caring about what lie underneath. There is some aspects of the Alex Murphy resurrection story trying to fight their way to the surface here but they are ruined by the fact that this film can't play with them because they might scare children and so instead we get rock'em sock 'em jetpacks. 'Robocop 3' probably shouldn't have been made. There really wasn't anything left to tell in the story. That being said I think Dekker and crew had the foundations upon which to build something had they not been told to make a children's films. I like the idea of an armed resistance finally fighting OCP because it is very much a natural endpoint to what Verhoven set up in the original. The problem is that in order to do this story right you have to go into some radical leftist territory that doesn't sell tickets or toys. Fred Dekker takes a great deal of criticism for the film's failure and I don't think that is particularly fair. If anything this film is above a bomb rating because Dekker can effectively stage really brilliant action sequences. I think 'Robocop 3' could have been a lot of fun had they given Dekker complete creative control. 'Night of the Creeps' is a very funny and visually fun gory horror film and a 'Robocop 3' made in those lines would have been an effective fun end to the trilogy. I like the action scenes provided that some of the stupid dialogue is taken away. The film is just a mess and a missed opportunity. I like to think that somehow this film could have been good and Fred Dekker would get the respect he deserves and that this great series would have had a proper ending. The problem is you can see a film company perverting something profound in order to make money. Orion was kind of like OCP in that regard...

    This third installment of Robocop in my opinion is the finest of the trilogy, because it hits home in the most accurate way predicting the future. Detroit is now a police state owned by a private corporation OCP. Everything is now the property of OCP including the private residence of an individual, and if you resist eviction, police will come in with a wrecking ball, and full military assault weapons. Humans are reduced to property as well, and anyone who fall out of the system, and resist the tyranny of OCP and the police is labeled "Terrorists". This is extremely close to the current situation of our country in that over half a million foreign troops are in United States because the US military has refused to shoot at American citizens. One executive order from the president can declare martial law, suspend constitution and privatize communication, transportation including cars, and property. It's amazing that this movie accurately predicted the future of the country 20 to 30 years before its time, and excites me to watch the take the producers had at the time the movie was made. The movie is well made, and contains irony as well as humor in the mix. For these reasons, this Robocop movie is the best of the three that's made for me.

    Although this final installment of Robocop doesn't measure up to the original 1987 masterpiece, or even the 1990 sequel, I've got a special place for it in my heart. That would be the "wtf did I just watch" chamber. If you remember the old 80s TV action shows... like "The A-Team", "Spenser: For Hire", "MacGyver", etc... you're halfway there. These were shows that didn't have a lot of substance but were fun to watch anyway. The plots were mostly predictable and the execution was corny, but that's precisely why we watch them. Robocop 3 is an unusual return to that style (whether by design or not). Plot is linear, scenes are bright, dialogue is snippy but not particularly witty, and dramatic/disturbing scenes are glossed over, almost as if it's made for a PG-13 audience (WHOA, I just realized this IS PG-13... while the first 2 films were rated R). Yet the film also injects spots of extreme violence and creepy dark humor... like the 2 or 3 "comedic" scenes of people committing suicide, which did make me laugh out loud, I admit. Those were the scenes I liked best because they remained true to the original dark satire of the original Robocop. I still don't view the Robocop trilogy as an action story but rather a brilliant dark comedy. Robocop 3 has the same bizarre news briefs and hilarious commercials peppered throughout, and although it's not as thick as in the original, the vibe is still there. But the overall feeling is one of campy 80s. Check out the hilarious 80s hairstyles & clothes (denim jackets... dear lord I thought we burned all of them!). Really bizarre. If the director intended it to be deliberately ironic, he's a freakin genius.

    This movie was just awful. The story was practically non existent. It felt like it was written by a group of 12 year olds who were bored and had no imagination. The script would have been better off if it had been turned into a TV episode. The acting was decidedly wooden in places although the actor who played Robocop wasn't to bad (could have been worse and could have been better). The whole movie is aimed at kids with all the gimmicky attachments for Robocop (flight pack and arm attachment) being nothing more than product placement for the tied in merchandising. Im giving this a 3 out of 10 because the only decent thing about the movie was the soundtrack.

    Vast improvement over the dreadful Part II, this still suffers from feeling watered-down, and overly kid-friendly, as Robocop returns to fight his own company again, who are ruthlessly trying to evict the citizens of Detroit to make a profit, and are trying to merge with a Japanese conglomerate, while at the same time stave off bankruptcy. Though there are some good action scenes, and its heart is in the right place, this feels tired, as if there was no sense of urgency or purpose behind it other than completing the story. A shame, because with a bit more story preparation, this could have been good, but feels rushed, though it sat on the shelf for two years! Does have a satisfying ending though.

    Although this final installment of Robocop doesn't measure up to the original 1987 masterpiece, or even the 1990 sequel, I've got a special place for it in my heart. That would be the "wtf did I just watch" chamber. If you remember the old 80s TV action shows... like "The A-Team", "Spenser: For Hire", "MacGyver", etc... you're halfway there. These were shows that didn't have a lot of substance but were fun to watch anyway. The plots were mostly predictable and the execution was corny, but that's precisely why we watch them. Robocop 3 is an unusual return to that style (whether by design or not). Plot is linear, scenes are bright, dialogue is snippy but not particularly witty, and dramatic/disturbing scenes are glossed over, almost as if it's made for a PG-13 audience (WHOA, I just realized this IS PG-13... while the first 2 films were rated R). Yet the film also injects spots of extreme violence and creepy dark humor... like the 2 or 3 "comedic" scenes of people committing suicide, which did make me laugh out loud, I admit. Those were the scenes I liked best because they remained true to the original dark satire of the original Robocop. I still don't view the Robocop trilogy as an action story but rather a brilliant dark comedy. Robocop 3 has the same bizarre news briefs and hilarious commercials peppered throughout, and although it's not as thick as in the original, the vibe is still there. But the overall feeling is one of campy 80s. Check out the hilarious 80s hairstyles & clothes (denim jackets... dear lord I thought we burned all of them!). Really bizarre. If the director intended it to be deliberately ironic, he's a freakin genius.

    This movie was just awful. The story was practically non existent. It felt like it was written by a group of 12 year olds who were bored and had no imagination. The script would have been better off if it had been turned into a TV episode. The acting was decidedly wooden in places although the actor who played Robocop wasn't to bad (could have been worse and could have been better). The whole movie is aimed at kids with all the gimmicky attachments for Robocop (flight pack and arm attachment) being nothing more than product placement for the tied in merchandising. Im giving this a 3 out of 10 because the only decent thing about the movie was the soundtrack.

    Vast improvement over the dreadful Part II, this still suffers from feeling watered-down, and overly kid-friendly, as Robocop returns to fight his own company again, who are ruthlessly trying to evict the citizens of Detroit to make a profit, and are trying to merge with a Japanese conglomerate, while at the same time stave off bankruptcy. Though there are some good action scenes, and its heart is in the right place, this feels tired, as if there was no sense of urgency or purpose behind it other than completing the story. A shame, because with a bit more story preparation, this could have been good, but feels rushed, though it sat on the shelf for two years! Does have a satisfying ending though.

    Robocop 3 is a brutal disaster,it is without a doubt the worst of the three Robocop's,and thats saying a lot comparing it to the also terrible Robocop 2.I thought the movie began promising,and I thought it seemed better than the second Robocop,but as soon as I saw Robert John Burke as Robocop I knew I was going to hate it,I never knew until I saw this that Peter Weller wasn't in it,and this guy was a terrible replacement,he made no effort to sound any bit similar to the original Robocop.Peter Weller was the only I liked about the second one,and thats what made this movie so terrible,at least they killed off Nancy Allen's character,I never liked her in it,her acting is amazingly terrible and was happy that she wasn't in this very much,but her acting for the beginning of the movie was probably even worse than she was in the first two.If you enjoyed the first Robocop,leave it at that,the sequels are both humiliating,their boring,predictable,too long and the cast are really uninspired,they made me question why I liked the first one.Do not bother with Robocop 2 or 3,trust me,even if you didn't see the first one and have nothing to compare it too,its still terrible. Robocop is completely fixed and takes on a large group that are looking to evict people from Detroit.

    The original Robocop, unless you're talking to fellow movie buffs like myself, is often seen as cheesy and over-the-top. In reality, the film is a pure "cult classic" if there ever was one. There are so many moral issues that flow subtly and neatly throughout the film, the violence is graphic and extreme-yet somewhat believable. The underlying comedic elements such as the TV commercials and newscasters are hilarious. The 2nd Robocop was good as well, although it fell more into the Hollywood tradition of trying too hard to do a sequel to match the first. A lot of the things I loved about 1 weren't in 2, but it was still good. Now we have 3. In every way it is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of the original and what Paul veerhoven set out to achieve with it. First off, PG-13? Cmon. The plot is filled with more bullet holes than the people that got shot up, Peter Weller isn't back and it shows, the acting is terrible, the action is terrible, not only is it by far the worst Robocop film ever, it is one THE worst films ever, period. A disgrace to what could have ended as an incredible franchise.

    I'll get right to the point with this one: I didn't give this movie a 1/10 because I got the chance to see the ED-209 again. I've always loved that robot. I thought it was so bad-ass when I first saw it. But the BS starts right after we see the ED-209, when that kid takes control of the droid with her computer toy made out of plastic. I mean is that computer toy something or what? It can hack into security cameras and broadcast videos all over the TV channels, it can hack into ED-209's memory, and the list goes on. There are so many things that don't add up in this movie. But the thing that most bothered me was robo's mouth. It looked like he was trying to take a number 2 throughout the whole movie. He looked horrible. Couldn't they have piked somebody else for the job? Everything about this movie is horrible. I didn't like anything I saw in it, the story is horrible and it stinks so bad it makes me wanna puke. Bottom line is... I won't even count it as one of the robocop movies because it doesn't deserve it. It's nothing but a pile of crap and it shouldn't belong on this planet.

    The OCP has now a powerful grip-lock on the city of Detroit. Along with their Japanese shareholders, even the Detroit Police Force is now under their jurisdiction as they are now working for them. With the Japanese shareholders they are in the process of destroying the already crumbling Detroit and transforming it into a more enhanced "Delta City". However liberal sewer dwellers who not going sit down and let this happen; they will revolt to any means necessary even if it means through violence and carnage. However, the OCP hires some "Rehab Teams" which are military police led by a menacing cyborg named McDaggett whose plan is to bring those who oppose the OCP and make them part of their justice. But the opposing liberals find a robot that will side with them. After the death of Officer Lewis (Nancy Allen), Robocop (Robert Burke) has become the defender of the rebels in their quest to win back their city and to take down the OCP of its own foundations. I'm sorry to say that this was the most unpleasant way to end the series. In fact they should have pulled the plug after the second instalment. Granted, the story had a lot of good things going for it, the script was the definitive Achilles Heel that really made the movie appalling, which also made the performances mediocre at best. The tone of violence was watered down badly as it went from an R rating in the first two instalments to a dismal PG-13 rating. Even the swearing was toned down gregariously as well. My guess was that the producers were trying to promote this film to a more broader audience. They went far as to have an animated version of "Robocop" as a way of making merchandise and if that's not enough to hurt a franchise, remember a few years ago Robocop invaded WCW wrestling and came to the aid of Sting (Steve Borden), that was pure ludicrous (Who remembers "Capitol Combat 90: The Return of Robocop") This is the worst thing since Rick Steiner having a verbal spat with Chucky from "Child's Play". Another factor that hurt the series was its frugal budget. The first movie you could not go wrong with the special effects. And the violence was gritty and effective as the bullets were aimed to perfection. The acting overall was a letdown too as the only character with spark (pun intended) was Robert Burke who filled in for Peter Weller as the heroic Police bot. With the new characters, the development was absent in this instalment. If you are curious and would like to see it I'm not stopping you. It's still enjoyable, but not very memorable.

    RoboCop's cinema outings come to an ignominious halt with this trashy, clueless sequel. Apparently mistaking the original film's black humour for knockabout comedy, director Fred Dekker slapsticks the character through a plot involving a ninja robot and a kiddie sidekick. Even the Media Breaks are used for cheap laughs; well, everything is cheap. Returning characters are shadows of their former selves, while new RoboCop Robert John Burke waddles around in Peter Weller's cast-offs like he's shat his pants. Come the end he's a poorly-bluescreened jetpack pilot in a sequence that not only reduces the character to a cartoonish parody but also transforms him into an action figure. Dekker's direction is apathetic, the villains are cartoons, the action is flat,the visual effects are dire and there isn't a single moment that doesn't fail in some way. This is a stupid, incompetent, unfunny, soulless junker, a travesty of the original movie.

    'Robocop 3' is a real turkey that for the most part deserves it's putrid reputation as one of the worst sequels of all time. It's a movie that offends me really more for the thought process behind it and for the aftermath it had on the career of director Fred Dekker. The film suffers because it has a violent tonal difference from it's far superior predecessors and any fan of those films is bound to be offended here. 'Robocop 3' is made solely for children because Orion thought they could sell toys. It's a kind of offensively ironic thought really because 'Robocop' is a movie that blatantly is about commercialism stealing the soul. I think as it's own piece 'Robocop 3' is merely a forgettable action film but as a sequel it is a slap in the face to the mythology and the fans. 'Robocop 3' feels as though you can feel Orion breath down the neck of the film. It is a children's film and it's a children's film in the worst possible way. It plays as if it thinks kids are stupid. This is a quintessential flaw, children are intelligent especially with adventure films. Why are films like 'Star Wars' or 'Superman' so brilliant at capturing the imagination of children and adults alike? Because they take time to develop a mythology and characters that are engrossing and spark the imagination. 'Robocop 3' is a sequel to two very adult films that have a mythology that deals with very adult themes that are beyond children's capacities. Gone completely in 'Robocop 3' is the violent anti-capitalist satire but even more important is the themes of losing one's humanity. Alex Murphy does not want to be Robocop. Robocop is a perversion of the laws of life and death and the first film is an exploration of what it is to be human. Sure Robocop looks cool but the aesthetics hide a troubled soul seeking to reclaim it's self. 'Robocop 3' is all about celebrating the cool looking aesthetics because they sell toys and not caring about what lie underneath. There is some aspects of the Alex Murphy resurrection story trying to fight their way to the surface here but they are ruined by the fact that this film can't play with them because they might scare children and so instead we get rock'em sock 'em jetpacks. 'Robocop 3' probably shouldn't have been made. There really wasn't anything left to tell in the story. That being said I think Dekker and crew had the foundations upon which to build something had they not been told to make a children's films. I like the idea of an armed resistance finally fighting OCP because it is very much a natural endpoint to what Verhoven set up in the original. The problem is that in order to do this story right you have to go into some radical leftist territory that doesn't sell tickets or toys. Fred Dekker takes a great deal of criticism for the film's failure and I don't think that is particularly fair. If anything this film is above a bomb rating because Dekker can effectively stage really brilliant action sequences. I think 'Robocop 3' could have been a lot of fun had they given Dekker complete creative control. 'Night of the Creeps' is a very funny and visually fun gory horror film and a 'Robocop 3' made in those lines would have been an effective fun end to the trilogy. I like the action scenes provided that some of the stupid dialogue is taken away. The film is just a mess and a missed opportunity. I like to think that somehow this film could have been good and Fred Dekker would get the respect he deserves and that this great series would have had a proper ending. The problem is you can see a film company perverting something profound in order to make money. Orion was kind of like OCP in that regard...

    This third installment of Robocop in my opinion is the finest of the trilogy, because it hits home in the most accurate way predicting the future. Detroit is now a police state owned by a private corporation OCP. Everything is now the property of OCP including the private residence of an individual, and if you resist eviction, police will come in with a wrecking ball, and full military assault weapons. Humans are reduced to property as well, and anyone who fall out of the system, and resist the tyranny of OCP and the police is labeled "Terrorists". This is extremely close to the current situation of our country in that over half a million foreign troops are in United States because the US military has refused to shoot at American citizens. One executive order from the president can declare martial law, suspend constitution and privatize communication, transportation including cars, and property. It's amazing that this movie accurately predicted the future of the country 20 to 30 years before its time, and excites me to watch the take the producers had at the time the movie was made. The movie is well made, and contains irony as well as humor in the mix. For these reasons, this Robocop movie is the best of the three that's made for me.

Gone completely in 'Robocop 3' is the violent anti-capitalist satire but even more important is the themes of losing one's humanity. Alex Murphy does not want to be Robocop. Robocop is a perversion of the laws of life and death and the first film is an exploration of what it is to be human. Sure Robocop looks cool but the aesthetics hide a troubled soul seeking to reclaim it's self. 'Robocop 3' is all about celebrating the cool looking aesthetics because they sell toys and not caring about what lie underneath. There is some aspects of the Alex Murphy resurrection story trying to fight their way to the surface here but they are ruined by the fact that this film can't play with them because they might scare children and so instead we get rock'em sock 'em jetpacks. 'Robocop 3' probably shouldn't have been made. There really wasn't anything left to tell in the story. That being said I think Dekker and crew had the foundations upon which to build something had they not been told to make a children's films. I like the idea of an armed resistance finally fighting OCP because it is very much a natural endpoint to what Verhoven set up in the original. The problem is that in order to do this story right you have to go into some radical leftist territory that doesn't sell tickets or toys. Fred Dekker takes a great deal of criticism for the film's failure and I don't think that is particularly fair. If anything this film is above a bomb rating because Dekker can effectively stage really brilliant action sequences. I think 'Robocop 3' could have been a lot of fun had they given Dekker complete creative control. 'Night of the Creeps' is a very funny and visually fun gory horror film and a 'Robocop 3' made in those lines would have been an effective fun end to the trilogy. I like the action scenes provided that some of the stupid dialogue is taken away. The film is just a mess and a missed opportunity. I like to think that somehow this film could have been good and Fred Dekker would get the respect he deserves and that this great series would have had a proper ending. The problem is you can see a film company perverting something profound in order to make money. Orion was kind of like OCP in that regard...

    This third installment of Robocop in my opinion is the finest of the trilogy, because it hits home in the most accurate way predicting the future. Detroit is now a police state owned by a private corporation OCP. Everything is now the property of OCP including the private residence of an individual, and if you resist eviction, police will come in with a wrecking ball, and full military assault weapons. Humans are reduced to property as well, and anyone who fall out of the system, and resist the tyranny of OCP and the police is labeled "Terrorists". This is extremely close to the current situation of our country in that over half a million foreign troops are in United States because the US military has refused to shoot at American citizens. One executive order from the president can declare martial law, suspend constitution and privatize communication, transportation including cars, and property. It's amazing that this movie accurately predicted the future of the country 20 to 30 years before its time, and excites me to watch the take the producers had at the time the movie was made. The movie is well made, and contains irony as well as humor in the mix. For these reasons, this Robocop movie is the best of the three that's made for me.

    Although this final installment of Robocop doesn't measure up to the original 1987 masterpiece, or even the 1990 sequel, I've got a special place for it in my heart. That would be the "wtf did I just watch" chamber. If you remember the old 80s TV action shows... like "The A-Team", "Spenser: For Hire", "MacGyver", etc... you're halfway there. These were shows that didn't have a lot of substance but were fun to watch anyway. The plots were mostly predictable and the execution was corny, but that's precisely why we watch them. Robocop 3 is an unusual return to that style (whether by design or not). Plot is linear, scenes are bright, dialogue is snippy but not particularly witty, and dramatic/disturbing scenes are glossed over, almost as if it's made for a PG-13 audience (WHOA, I just realized this IS PG-13... while the first 2 films were rated R). Yet the film also injects spots of extreme violence and creepy dark humor... like the 2 or 3 "comedic" scenes of people committing suicide, which did make me laugh out loud, I admit. Those were the scenes I liked best because they remained true to the original dark satire of the original Robocop. I still don't view the Robocop trilogy as an action story but rather a brilliant dark comedy. Robocop 3 has the same bizarre news briefs and hilarious commercials peppered throughout, and although it's not as thick as in the original, the vibe is still there. But the overall feeling is one of campy 80s. Check out the hilarious 80s hairstyles & clothes (denim jackets... dear lord I thought we burned all of them!). Really bizarre. If the director intended it to be deliberately ironic, he's a freakin genius.

    This movie was just awful. The story was practically non existent. It felt like it was written by a group of 12 year olds who were bored and had no imagination. The script would have been better off if it had been turned into a TV episode. The acting was decidedly wooden in places although the actor who played Robocop wasn't to bad (could have been worse and could have been better). The whole movie is aimed at kids with all the gimmicky attachments for Robocop (flight pack and arm attachment) being nothing more than product placement for the tied in merchandising. Im giving this a 3 out of 10 because the only decent thing about the movie was the soundtrack.

    Vast improvement over the dreadful Part II, this still suffers from feeling watered-down, and overly kid-friendly, as Robocop returns to fight his own company again, who are ruthlessly trying to evict the citizens of Detroit to make a profit, and are trying to merge with a Japanese conglomerate, while at the same time stave off bankruptcy. Though there are some good action scenes, and its heart is in the right place, this feels tired, as if there was no sense of urgency or purpose behind it other than completing the story. A shame, because with a bit more story preparation, this could have been good, but feels rushed, though it sat on the shelf for two years! Does have a satisfying ending though.

    Robocop 3 is a brutal disaster,it is without a doubt the worst of the three Robocop's,and thats saying a lot comparing it to the also terrible Robocop 2.I thought the movie began promising,and I thought it seemed better than the second Robocop,but as soon as I saw Robert John Burke as Robocop I knew I was going to hate it,I never knew until I saw this that Peter Weller wasn't in it,and this guy was a terrible replacement,he made no effort to sound any bit similar to the original Robocop.Peter Weller was the only I liked about the second one,and thats what made this movie so terrible,at least they killed off Nancy Allen's character,I never liked her in it,her acting is amazingly terrible and was happy that she wasn't in this very much,but her acting for the beginning of the movie was probably even worse than she was in the first two.If you enjoyed the first Robocop,leave it at that,the sequels are both humiliating,their boring,predictable,too long and the cast are really uninspired,they made me question why I liked the first one.Do not bother with Robocop 2 or 3,trust me,even if you didn't see the first one and have nothing to compare it too,its still terrible. Robocop is completely fixed and takes on a large group that are looking to evict people from Detroit.

    The original Robocop, unless you're talking to fellow movie buffs like myself, is often seen as cheesy and over-the-top. In reality, the film is a pure "cult classic" if there ever was one. There are so many moral issues that flow subtly and neatly throughout the film, the violence is graphic and extreme-yet somewhat believable. The underlying comedic elements such as the TV commercials and newscasters are hilarious. The 2nd Robocop was good as well, although it fell more into the Hollywood tradition of trying too hard to do a sequel to match the first. A lot of the things I loved about 1 weren't in 2, but it was still good. Now we have 3. In every way it is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of the original and what Paul veerhoven set out to achieve with it. First off, PG-13? Cmon. The plot is filled with more bullet holes than the people that got shot up, Peter Weller isn't back and it shows, the acting is terrible, the action is terrible, not only is it by far the worst Robocop film ever, it is one THE worst films ever, period. A disgrace to what could have ended as an incredible franchise.

    I'll get right to the point with this one: I didn't give this movie a 1/10 because I got the chance to see the ED-209 again. I've always loved that robot. I thought it was so bad-ass when I first saw it. But the BS starts right after we see the ED-209, when that kid takes control of the droid with her computer toy made out of plastic. I mean is that computer toy something or what? It can hack into security cameras and broadcast videos all over the TV channels, it can hack into ED-209's memory, and the list goes on. There are so many things that don't add up in this movie. But the thing that most bothered me was robo's mouth. It looked like he was trying to take a number 2 throughout the whole movie. He looked horrible. Couldn't they have piked somebody else for the job? Everything about this movie is horrible. I didn't like anything I saw in it, the story is horrible and it stinks so bad it makes me wanna puke. Bottom line is... I won't even count it as one of the robocop movies because it doesn't deserve it. It's nothing but a pile of crap and it shouldn't belong on this planet.

    The OCP has now a powerful grip-lock on the city of Detroit. Along with their Japanese shareholders, even the Detroit Police Force is now under their jurisdiction as they are now working for them. With the Japanese shareholders they are in the process of destroying the already crumbling Detroit and transforming it into a more enhanced "Delta City". However liberal sewer dwellers who not going sit down and let this happen; they will revolt to any means necessary even if it means through violence and carnage. However, the OCP hires some "Rehab Teams" which are military police led by a menacing cyborg named McDaggett whose plan is to bring those who oppose the OCP and make them part of their justice. But the opposing liberals find a robot that will side with them. After the death of Officer Lewis (Nancy Allen), Robocop (Robert Burke) has become the defender of the rebels in their quest to win back their city and to take down the OCP of its own foundations. I'm sorry to say that this was the most unpleasant way to end the series. In fact they should have pulled the plug after the second instalment. Granted, the story had a lot of good things going for it, the script was the definitive Achilles Heel that really made the movie appalling, which also made the performances mediocre at best. The tone of violence was watered down badly as it went from an R rating in the first two instalments to a dismal PG-13 rating. Even the swearing was toned down gregariously as well. My guess was that the producers were trying to promote this film to a more broader audience. They went far as to have an animated version of "Robocop" as a way of making merchandise and if that's not enough to hurt a franchise, remember a few years ago Robocop invaded WCW wrestling and came to the aid of Sting (Steve Borden), that was pure ludicrous (Who remembers "Capitol Combat 90: The Return of Robocop") This is the worst thing since Rick Steiner having a verbal spat with Chucky from "Child's Play". Another factor that hurt the series was its frugal budget. The first movie you could not go wrong with the special effects. And the violence was gritty and effective as the bullets were aimed to perfection. The acting overall was a letdown too as the only character with spark (pun intended) was Robert Burke who filled in for Peter Weller as the heroic Police bot. With the new characters, the development was absent in this instalment. If you are curious and would like to see it I'm not stopping you. It's still enjoyable, but not very memorable.

    RoboCop's cinema outings come to an ignominious halt with this trashy, clueless sequel. Apparently mistaking the original film's black humour for knockabout comedy, director Fred Dekker slapsticks the character through a plot involving a ninja robot and a kiddie sidekick. Even the Media Breaks are used for cheap laughs; well, everything is cheap. Returning characters are shadows of their former selves, while new RoboCop Robert John Burke waddles around in Peter Weller's cast-offs like he's shat his pants. Come the end he's a poorly-bluescreened jetpack pilot in a sequence that not only reduces the character to a cartoonish parody but also transforms him into an action figure. Dekker's direction is apathetic, the villains are cartoons, the action is flat,the visual effects are dire and there isn't a single moment that doesn't fail in some way. This is a stupid, incompetent, unfunny, soulless junker, a travesty of the original movie.

    'Robocop 3' is a real turkey that for the most part deserves it's putrid reputation as one of the worst sequels of all time. It's a movie that offends me really more for the thought process behind it and for the aftermath it had on the career of director Fred Dekker. The film suffers because it has a violent tonal difference from it's far superior predecessors and any fan of those films is bound to be offended here. 'Robocop 3' is made solely for children because Orion thought they could sell toys. It's a kind of offensively ironic thought really because 'Robocop' is a movie that blatantly is about commercialism stealing the soul. I think as it's own piece 'Robocop 3' is merely a forgettable action film but as a sequel it is a slap in the face to the mythology and the fans. 'Robocop 3' feels as though you can feel Orion breath down the neck of the film. It is a children's film and it's a children's film in the worst possible way. It plays as if it thinks kids are stupid. This is a quintessential flaw, children are intelligent especially with adventure films. Why are films like 'Star Wars' or 'Superman' so brilliant at capturing the imagination of children and adults alike? Because they take time to develop a mythology and characters that are engrossing and spark the imagination. 'Robocop 3' is a sequel to two very adult films that have a mythology that deals with very adult themes that are beyond children's capacities. Gone completely in 'Robocop 3' is the violent anti-capitalist satire but even more important is the themes of losing one's humanity. Alex Murphy does not want to be Robocop. Robocop is a perversion of the laws of life and death and the first film is an exploration of what it is to be human. Sure Robocop looks cool but the aesthetics hide a troubled soul seeking to reclaim it's self. 'Robocop 3' is all about celebrating the cool looking aesthetics because they sell toys and not caring about what lie underneath. There is some aspects of the Alex Murphy resurrection story trying to fight their way to the surface here but they are ruined by the fact that this film can't play with them because they might scare children and so instead we get rock'em sock 'em jetpacks. 'Robocop 3' probably shouldn't have been made. There really wasn't anything left to tell in the story.

I like the idea of an armed resistance finally fighting OCP because it is very much a natural endpoint to what Verhoven set up in the original. The problem is that in order to do this story right you have to go into some radical leftist territory that doesn't sell tickets or toys. Fred Dekker takes a great deal of criticism for the film's failure and I don't think that is particularly fair. If anything this film is above a bomb rating because Dekker can effectively stage really brilliant action sequences.
