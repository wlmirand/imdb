 <sinopse>
  Three friends discover their new flatmate dead but loaded with cash.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  To avoid spoiling the movie this plot summary is very brief. It starts when three people living together in a four bedroom flat are looking for a house mate. The interviews they conduct are very unorthodox and very funny. Eventually the three agree on one prospective tenant. He moves in, locks his door, and is not seen again. After a couple of days the three become curious and break in to his room. What follows is an amazing piece of cinema and to say more would ruin it.

    At his best, Danny Boyle is one of our finest living filmmakers. And if this 1st feature isn't quite up to the level of the best of his work, it still shows one heck of a lot of talent. That said, while enjoyable and full of energy and solid performances, this didn't hold up as well on 2nd viewing as I'd hoped. This caper drama about 3 self obsessed, comically awful 20 somethings who fall into a bag of money and slowly turn on each other has a lot of dark cynical fun in it, but there are just too many logic holes and too many character leaps to be fully satisfying. A lot of the twists are clever (although some are predictable) but rather than characters evolving, they seem to lurch suddenly on their way down the rat hole to beyond forgivable. You accept the sudden transformations because they're there, but it did leave me wondering 'when did THAT suddenly happen to the character'. In turn, that underlines the film's somewhat cartoony nature, which makes sure it's never too disturbing to enjoy no matter how awfully everyone behaves, but that also robs it of the chance of being a deeper film than just a fun, smart genre exercise. With "Trainspotting" Boyle went on to find that perfect balance of surface fun, and deeper meanings, but this is a good first step.

    This singular Shallow Grave, first feature for Danny Boyle and the first of his three collaborations with Ewan McGregor, already showed in 1994 all the potential of the English director. The premise, everybody imagined at least once, is relatively simple but the script of this tragedy unfolds in an implacable way from start to finish, in an intriguing and heavy atmosphere that captivates the viewer. The characters composing this trio are complementary and each evolve differently until the ultra cynical final outcome punctuated with an unsuspected mini twist. However, the movie could be blamed for what also makes its strength, which is his absurd aspect maybe a bit too absurd. Moreover, the editing could have deserved a bit more coherence.

    "Shallow Grave" is a film by Danny Boyle from 1994, starring Kerry Fox, Ewan McGregor, and Christopher Eccleston. The three stars play roommates looking for a fourth, who put applicants through a bizarre series of questions and then laugh themselves sick afterward. They're three crazy, silly kids, McGregor is Alex, a reporter, Eccleston is David, an accountant, and Fox is Juliet, a doctor. Finally, with Fox's encouragement, they choose a fourth roommate, Hugo (Keith Allen), who is found dead in his bed. Underneath the bed is his suitcase, filled with more money than any of them have ever seen. Unbenownst to them, two men are torturing a third asking where Hugo is, and it's clear they'll stop at nothing until they find Hugo and the money. Alex decides it's best if they chop the body up and bury it sans hands, feet, and teeth. David gets the short straw and has to do the chopping, and Juliet brings the hands and feet to the hospital and disposes of them there. They roll the car into the river. At that point, the friendships begin to change, and most of all, David begins to change, and the story takes on much darker elements. Absolutely bizarre film, definitely not my type of thing, so I may not be the best person to comment on it. Boyle does a fabulous job, as do the actors, of depicting a life-changing, friendship-changing moment and the danger and terror that follows, not to mention the lack of trust and strange behavior. Extremely interesting film if you can stand all the violence. It doesn't all make sense but boy, it keeps you engrossed. I saw Danny Boyle's Frankenstein on the stage. He's a master with a fresh point of view.

    Spoiler Alert: I can tear the entire plot in half with one half-brained thought. If you know the jist of the movie, you know three people have a roommate who dies and leaves a suitcase full of money. So they decide to hack him up and bury his body? You're kidding, right? Why would anybody do that? You would just take the suitcase, put it in your room, and then call the police. BAMMMMM!!!!! End of movie! The body would be legally removed, and you would keep the money. Unfortunately, the movie just gets worse from there. It's the most predictable movie I've ever seen. It's just "Halloween" type music playing while they show some awful slow scenes. Nothing good. Save your time! Don't buy into the hype of people who give it a high rating because of the director; he might have other good films, but this isn't one of them!

    Immediately they should have hidden the money. Then call the police about the body. Then when all the investigating is over split the money. And each goes their own way. Until they meet again all prosperous. But apart from that it was a tight all suspenseful movie. Never undermine anybody! Thing is my way would not have got that guy all messed up. Love the snappy humor. Could they not have chopped the body up together? Done pieces in turns maybe? Share the responsibility. My favorite part was when under questioning the chick was asked whether she remembers people by their faces or names best. And being a nurse she says "diseases". Then the investigator says that just like her he recalls people's behavior by their crimes. I do recommend this movie.

    Danny Boyle's directorial debut remains a satisfying, stylish and twisted little black comedy thriller. It features fledgling wannabes Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston and Ewan McGregor as yuppie flatmates taking in a new lodger to share the bills. It isn't long before Hugo the lodger is found dead in bed from an overdose and the three smug and selfish twenty-somethings find themselves in possession of a suitcase full of loot. Naturally, they want the money, but what to do about Hugo? Then there's the little matter of the two gangland killers who are looking for Hugo and the dough. The scene is set for a grisly and wicked ramble through the intricate highways and byways of body disposal, murder and duplicitous double-crossing. Part thriller, part jet black satire on the corrosive dysfunction characterising Thatcher's self-centred and greed-obsessed 90s babies, Boyle has a keen eye for social comment and a scalpel sharp sense of morbid humour. There is much to enjoy, notably Eccleston's mental devolution from straight-laced and OCD accountant to paranoid and murderous loft dweller, Fox's moral dissipation to ruthless femme-fatale using sexual promiscuity to get what she wants, and McGregor's persona downturn from confident, wired and irresponsible journo to nervy and fearful potential victim in line. It's great nasty fun, with pleasingly reverent nods to Hitchcock, and the payoff (if you don't know it) is a wry little cracker. A deliciously cruel gem of a movie.

    Christopher Eccleston, Ewan McGregor and Kerry Fox give solidly disturbing leading performances as three flat mates who attempt to cover up a murder in an attempt to gain a handsome stash of cash from the victim. The plot is simple enough and the characters in the film have well developed personalities and attributes. Eccleston is particularly impressive as he begins to form a paranoid schizophrenic following guilt of the act he played a vital part in. Ewan McGregor adds a delicate essence of dark humour while Fox is a rather complex character who you never fully understand. 'Shallow Grave' is a solid thriller which has a great casting line up but many parts of the film are rather peculiar and the climax is frustrating if cleverly accomplished.

    Years prior to winning the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle directed the dark comedy, Shallow Grave. Ewan McGregor is Alex, a journalist, who along with his friends, David an accountant, and Julia, a doctor, rent a flat in Edinburgh. The fourth person has left and they place an ad for a replacement. After a series of rejections, they rent to a mysterious man named Hugo. He shortly thereafter dies of a drug overdose, and they find a large amount of cash hidden away. Human nature and greed soon take over as the three remaining tenants decide to divide the money up and hide the dearly departed's corpse in a shallow grave. That's when all the fun begins, as they struggle to find Hugo a final resting place. I would compare Boyle's work to the Coen brothers Fargo for it's grave(excuse the pun) view of the nature of man; and woman, in this case. It is both funny and violent, and a real hidden treasure.

    'Shallow Grave' marks now-Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle's directorial d&eacute;but, and also shows Hollywood actors like Ewan McGregor before they found great success. The first thing to note, then, is that those involved in 'Shallow Grave' have been propelled from this humble, independent British film to massive, big-budget blockbusters in just a few years. The second thing to note is that the plot is simple - almost too simple. However, Boyle easily keeps the excitement up, right up to (and especially) the final shot. The film is about three friends. From the first scene (a wonderful montage), it is not hard to deduce that these people are unpleasant. They trick and make fun of potential flat-mates just to fulfil their twisted, sadistic pleasures; we watch with surprising glee as they effortlessly humiliate unsuspecting Scots. However, one applicant catches their attention; an intriguing man named Hugo. When they find him dead in his new room, however, things start to get dark. Hugo came with a suitcase full of money. After deciding to take the said money, things get darker. Paranoia, suspicion and deception run riot between the three; disposing of the body makes a particularly grisly scene, despite no blood being shown; Boyle teases the viewer and creates an almost over-the-top situation. Like so much of 'Shallow Grave', it teeters on the edge of laugh-out-loud humour perfectly. The performances are top-notch; McGregor plays the unnervingly flippant Alex perfectly; Kerry Fox is brilliantly cast as the stuck-up, selfish Juliet and Christopher Eccleston is fantastic as the paranoid, sensible(ish) David. They have great chemistry together and they manage to bring sympathy to what are, in essence, horrible people. The real stars, however, are behind the camera. Boyle creates a quirky, almost surreal world, photographed with just enough satire by Brian Tufano. There are some truly ingeniously shot scenes, perhaps most notably being one involving holes in the ceiling and a frantic David. What Boyle manages to do is tear your feelings - you want them to get horribly mutilated because they are a sick bunch, but at the same time you want them to get away with it because, for reasons unbeknownst to you, you can sympathise with them. Maybe it's because you feel sorry for them being dragged into it. Maybe it's because you like mean people. Or, maybe it's because you're not sure you'd do any better. Whatever it is, you will enjoy it (and will probably argue with someone about the ending).

    Shallow Grave Danny Boyles first ever film, Shallow Grave is a solid and enjoyable thriller. The film definitely exhibits some very Boyle characteristics, from Nudity, to realism, and the film using two of Boyles preferred actors, Eccelstone and McGregor. I really enjoy this film, at 89 minutes it is a short film by most standards, yet it fits a lot of action and plot into that time. The 3 lead characters are all great, they are all supposed to be cold hearted and horrible people. The acting of Eccelstone in particular though is amazing. I really enjoy watching him going crazy on screen. I also enjoy the other characters reactions to his increasing Paranoia. Mcgregor is also good, a lot of people criticise his acting in recent years, yet I think a lot of his earlier films show that he is actually a very talented individual. I really enjoy how his two counterparts become more and more worried about what they've done, whilst it really doesn't affect him at all, until his sudden bout of self serving concern towards the end of the film. I really enjoy the setting and the music in the film as well. The music, it could be said is very standard thriller stuff, but to me it adds a lot to the picture and builds up the on screen suspense well. As I say I also think the setting is good, I like the flat, and I think it certainly increases the sense of creeping madness, with the deliberately toned down colour scheme and the long spiralling staircase. I do have some criticisms, there are some obvious gaffes, on occasion there is camera or crew visible. Also the film does seem to steal a lot of it's aspects from many other thrillers, especially Psycho. I do enjoy the ending, it is certainly a surprise. I also like the small amount of ambiguity, we know enough to make assumptions about the film, but beyond the obvious it is unsure what happens. For his first film, Boyle has done a good job and he has clearly laid the foundations for Trainspotting

I really enjoy this film, at 89 minutes it is a short film by most standards, yet it fits a lot of action and plot into that time. The 3 lead characters are all great, they are all supposed to be cold hearted and horrible people. The acting of Eccelstone in particular though is amazing. I really enjoy watching him going crazy on screen. I also enjoy the other characters reactions to his increasing Paranoia. Mcgregor is also good, a lot of people criticise his acting in recent years, yet I think a lot of his earlier films show that he is actually a very talented individual. I really enjoy how his two counterparts become more and more worried about what they've done, whilst it really doesn't affect him at all, until his sudden bout of self serving concern towards the end of the film. I really enjoy the setting and the music in the film as well. The music, it could be said is very standard thriller stuff, but to me it adds a lot to the picture and builds up the on screen suspense well. As I say I also think the setting is good, I like the flat, and I think it certainly increases the sense of creeping madness, with the deliberately toned down colour scheme and the long spiralling staircase. I do have some criticisms, there are some obvious gaffes, on occasion there is camera or crew visible. Also the film does seem to steal a lot of it's aspects from many other thrillers, especially Psycho. I do enjoy the ending, it is certainly a surprise. I also like the small amount of ambiguity, we know enough to make assumptions about the film, but beyond the obvious it is unsure what happens. For his first film, Boyle has done a good job and he has clearly laid the foundations for Trainspotting

    At his best, Danny Boyle is one of our finest living filmmakers. And if this 1st feature isn't quite up to the level of the best of his work, it still shows one heck of a lot of talent. That said, while enjoyable and full of energy and solid performances, this didn't hold up as well on 2nd viewing as I'd hoped. This caper drama about 3 self obsessed, comically awful 20 somethings who fall into a bag of money and slowly turn on each other has a lot of dark cynical fun in it, but there are just too many logic holes and too many character leaps to be fully satisfying. A lot of the twists are clever (although some are predictable) but rather than characters evolving, they seem to lurch suddenly on their way down the rat hole to beyond forgivable. You accept the sudden transformations because they're there, but it did leave me wondering 'when did THAT suddenly happen to the character'. In turn, that underlines the film's somewhat cartoony nature, which makes sure it's never too disturbing to enjoy no matter how awfully everyone behaves, but that also robs it of the chance of being a deeper film than just a fun, smart genre exercise. With "Trainspotting" Boyle went on to find that perfect balance of surface fun, and deeper meanings, but this is a good first step.

    This singular Shallow Grave, first feature for Danny Boyle and the first of his three collaborations with Ewan McGregor, already showed in 1994 all the potential of the English director. The premise, everybody imagined at least once, is relatively simple but the script of this tragedy unfolds in an implacable way from start to finish, in an intriguing and heavy atmosphere that captivates the viewer. The characters composing this trio are complementary and each evolve differently until the ultra cynical final outcome punctuated with an unsuspected mini twist. However, the movie could be blamed for what also makes its strength, which is his absurd aspect maybe a bit too absurd. Moreover, the editing could have deserved a bit more coherence.

    "Shallow Grave" is a film by Danny Boyle from 1994, starring Kerry Fox, Ewan McGregor, and Christopher Eccleston. The three stars play roommates looking for a fourth, who put applicants through a bizarre series of questions and then laugh themselves sick afterward. They're three crazy, silly kids, McGregor is Alex, a reporter, Eccleston is David, an accountant, and Fox is Juliet, a doctor. Finally, with Fox's encouragement, they choose a fourth roommate, Hugo (Keith Allen), who is found dead in his bed. Underneath the bed is his suitcase, filled with more money than any of them have ever seen. Unbenownst to them, two men are torturing a third asking where Hugo is, and it's clear they'll stop at nothing until they find Hugo and the money. Alex decides it's best if they chop the body up and bury it sans hands, feet, and teeth. David gets the short straw and has to do the chopping, and Juliet brings the hands and feet to the hospital and disposes of them there. They roll the car into the river. At that point, the friendships begin to change, and most of all, David begins to change, and the story takes on much darker elements. Absolutely bizarre film, definitely not my type of thing, so I may not be the best person to comment on it. Boyle does a fabulous job, as do the actors, of depicting a life-changing, friendship-changing moment and the danger and terror that follows, not to mention the lack of trust and strange behavior. Extremely interesting film if you can stand all the violence. It doesn't all make sense but boy, it keeps you engrossed. I saw Danny Boyle's Frankenstein on the stage. He's a master with a fresh point of view.

    Spoiler Alert: I can tear the entire plot in half with one half-brained thought. If you know the jist of the movie, you know three people have a roommate who dies and leaves a suitcase full of money. So they decide to hack him up and bury his body? You're kidding, right? Why would anybody do that? You would just take the suitcase, put it in your room, and then call the police. BAMMMMM!!!!! End of movie! The body would be legally removed, and you would keep the money. Unfortunately, the movie just gets worse from there. It's the most predictable movie I've ever seen. It's just "Halloween" type music playing while they show some awful slow scenes. Nothing good. Save your time! Don't buy into the hype of people who give it a high rating because of the director; he might have other good films, but this isn't one of them!

    Immediately they should have hidden the money. Then call the police about the body. Then when all the investigating is over split the money. And each goes their own way. Until they meet again all prosperous. But apart from that it was a tight all suspenseful movie. Never undermine anybody! Thing is my way would not have got that guy all messed up. Love the snappy humor. Could they not have chopped the body up together? Done pieces in turns maybe? Share the responsibility. My favorite part was when under questioning the chick was asked whether she remembers people by their faces or names best. And being a nurse she says "diseases". Then the investigator says that just like her he recalls people's behavior by their crimes. I do recommend this movie.

    Danny Boyle's directorial debut remains a satisfying, stylish and twisted little black comedy thriller. It features fledgling wannabes Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston and Ewan McGregor as yuppie flatmates taking in a new lodger to share the bills. It isn't long before Hugo the lodger is found dead in bed from an overdose and the three smug and selfish twenty-somethings find themselves in possession of a suitcase full of loot. Naturally, they want the money, but what to do about Hugo? Then there's the little matter of the two gangland killers who are looking for Hugo and the dough. The scene is set for a grisly and wicked ramble through the intricate highways and byways of body disposal, murder and duplicitous double-crossing. Part thriller, part jet black satire on the corrosive dysfunction characterising Thatcher's self-centred and greed-obsessed 90s babies, Boyle has a keen eye for social comment and a scalpel sharp sense of morbid humour. There is much to enjoy, notably Eccleston's mental devolution from straight-laced and OCD accountant to paranoid and murderous loft dweller, Fox's moral dissipation to ruthless femme-fatale using sexual promiscuity to get what she wants, and McGregor's persona downturn from confident, wired and irresponsible journo to nervy and fearful potential victim in line. It's great nasty fun, with pleasingly reverent nods to Hitchcock, and the payoff (if you don't know it) is a wry little cracker. A deliciously cruel gem of a movie.

    Christopher Eccleston, Ewan McGregor and Kerry Fox give solidly disturbing leading performances as three flat mates who attempt to cover up a murder in an attempt to gain a handsome stash of cash from the victim. The plot is simple enough and the characters in the film have well developed personalities and attributes. Eccleston is particularly impressive as he begins to form a paranoid schizophrenic following guilt of the act he played a vital part in. Ewan McGregor adds a delicate essence of dark humour while Fox is a rather complex character who you never fully understand. 'Shallow Grave' is a solid thriller which has a great casting line up but many parts of the film are rather peculiar and the climax is frustrating if cleverly accomplished.

    Years prior to winning the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle directed the dark comedy, Shallow Grave. Ewan McGregor is Alex, a journalist, who along with his friends, David an accountant, and Julia, a doctor, rent a flat in Edinburgh. The fourth person has left and they place an ad for a replacement. After a series of rejections, they rent to a mysterious man named Hugo. He shortly thereafter dies of a drug overdose, and they find a large amount of cash hidden away. Human nature and greed soon take over as the three remaining tenants decide to divide the money up and hide the dearly departed's corpse in a shallow grave. That's when all the fun begins, as they struggle to find Hugo a final resting place. I would compare Boyle's work to the Coen brothers Fargo for it's grave(excuse the pun) view of the nature of man; and woman, in this case. It is both funny and violent, and a real hidden treasure.

    'Shallow Grave' marks now-Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle's directorial d&eacute;but, and also shows Hollywood actors like Ewan McGregor before they found great success. The first thing to note, then, is that those involved in 'Shallow Grave' have been propelled from this humble, independent British film to massive, big-budget blockbusters in just a few years. The second thing to note is that the plot is simple - almost too simple. However, Boyle easily keeps the excitement up, right up to (and especially) the final shot. The film is about three friends. From the first scene (a wonderful montage), it is not hard to deduce that these people are unpleasant. They trick and make fun of potential flat-mates just to fulfil their twisted, sadistic pleasures; we watch with surprising glee as they effortlessly humiliate unsuspecting Scots. However, one applicant catches their attention; an intriguing man named Hugo. When they find him dead in his new room, however, things start to get dark. Hugo came with a suitcase full of money. After deciding to take the said money, things get darker. Paranoia, suspicion and deception run riot between the three; disposing of the body makes a particularly grisly scene, despite no blood being shown; Boyle teases the viewer and creates an almost over-the-top situation. Like so much of 'Shallow Grave', it teeters on the edge of laugh-out-loud humour perfectly. The performances are top-notch; McGregor plays the unnervingly flippant Alex perfectly; Kerry Fox is brilliantly cast as the stuck-up, selfish Juliet and Christopher Eccleston is fantastic as the paranoid, sensible(ish) David. They have great chemistry together and they manage to bring sympathy to what are, in essence, horrible people. The real stars, however, are behind the camera. Boyle creates a quirky, almost surreal world, photographed with just enough satire by Brian Tufano. There are some truly ingeniously shot scenes, perhaps most notably being one involving holes in the ceiling and a frantic David. What Boyle manages to do is tear your feelings - you want them to get horribly mutilated because they are a sick bunch, but at the same time you want them to get away with it because, for reasons unbeknownst to you, you can sympathise with them. Maybe it's because you feel sorry for them being dragged into it. Maybe it's because you like mean people. Or, maybe it's because you're not sure you'd do any better. Whatever it is, you will enjoy it (and will probably argue with someone about the ending).

Mcgregor is also good, a lot of people criticise his acting in recent years, yet I think a lot of his earlier films show that he is actually a very talented individual. I really enjoy how his two counterparts become more and more worried about what they've done, whilst it really doesn't affect him at all, until his sudden bout of self serving concern towards the end of the film. I really enjoy the setting and the music in the film as well. The music, it could be said is very standard thriller stuff, but to me it adds a lot to the picture and builds up the on screen suspense well. As I say I also think the setting is good, I like the flat, and I think it certainly increases the sense of creeping madness, with the deliberately toned down colour scheme and the long spiralling staircase. I do have some criticisms, there are some obvious gaffes, on occasion there is camera or crew visible. Also the film does seem to steal a lot of it's aspects from many other thrillers, especially Psycho. I do enjoy the ending, it is certainly a surprise. I also like the small amount of ambiguity, we know enough to make assumptions about the film, but beyond the obvious it is unsure what happens. For his first film, Boyle has done a good job and he has clearly laid the foundations for Trainspotting

    At his best, Danny Boyle is one of our finest living filmmakers. And if this 1st feature isn't quite up to the level of the best of his work, it still shows one heck of a lot of talent. That said, while enjoyable and full of energy and solid performances, this didn't hold up as well on 2nd viewing as I'd hoped. This caper drama about 3 self obsessed, comically awful 20 somethings who fall into a bag of money and slowly turn on each other has a lot of dark cynical fun in it, but there are just too many logic holes and too many character leaps to be fully satisfying. A lot of the twists are clever (although some are predictable) but rather than characters evolving, they seem to lurch suddenly on their way down the rat hole to beyond forgivable. You accept the sudden transformations because they're there, but it did leave me wondering 'when did THAT suddenly happen to the character'. In turn, that underlines the film's somewhat cartoony nature, which makes sure it's never too disturbing to enjoy no matter how awfully everyone behaves, but that also robs it of the chance of being a deeper film than just a fun, smart genre exercise. With "Trainspotting" Boyle went on to find that perfect balance of surface fun, and deeper meanings, but this is a good first step.

    This singular Shallow Grave, first feature for Danny Boyle and the first of his three collaborations with Ewan McGregor, already showed in 1994 all the potential of the English director. The premise, everybody imagined at least once, is relatively simple but the script of this tragedy unfolds in an implacable way from start to finish, in an intriguing and heavy atmosphere that captivates the viewer. The characters composing this trio are complementary and each evolve differently until the ultra cynical final outcome punctuated with an unsuspected mini twist. However, the movie could be blamed for what also makes its strength, which is his absurd aspect maybe a bit too absurd. Moreover, the editing could have deserved a bit more coherence.

    "Shallow Grave" is a film by Danny Boyle from 1994, starring Kerry Fox, Ewan McGregor, and Christopher Eccleston. The three stars play roommates looking for a fourth, who put applicants through a bizarre series of questions and then laugh themselves sick afterward. They're three crazy, silly kids, McGregor is Alex, a reporter, Eccleston is David, an accountant, and Fox is Juliet, a doctor. Finally, with Fox's encouragement, they choose a fourth roommate, Hugo (Keith Allen), who is found dead in his bed. Underneath the bed is his suitcase, filled with more money than any of them have ever seen. Unbenownst to them, two men are torturing a third asking where Hugo is, and it's clear they'll stop at nothing until they find Hugo and the money. Alex decides it's best if they chop the body up and bury it sans hands, feet, and teeth. David gets the short straw and has to do the chopping, and Juliet brings the hands and feet to the hospital and disposes of them there. They roll the car into the river. At that point, the friendships begin to change, and most of all, David begins to change, and the story takes on much darker elements. Absolutely bizarre film, definitely not my type of thing, so I may not be the best person to comment on it. Boyle does a fabulous job, as do the actors, of depicting a life-changing, friendship-changing moment and the danger and terror that follows, not to mention the lack of trust and strange behavior. Extremely interesting film if you can stand all the violence. It doesn't all make sense but boy, it keeps you engrossed. I saw Danny Boyle's Frankenstein on the stage. He's a master with a fresh point of view.

    Spoiler Alert: I can tear the entire plot in half with one half-brained thought. If you know the jist of the movie, you know three people have a roommate who dies and leaves a suitcase full of money. So they decide to hack him up and bury his body? You're kidding, right? Why would anybody do that? You would just take the suitcase, put it in your room, and then call the police. BAMMMMM!!!!! End of movie! The body would be legally removed, and you would keep the money. Unfortunately, the movie just gets worse from there. It's the most predictable movie I've ever seen. It's just "Halloween" type music playing while they show some awful slow scenes. Nothing good. Save your time! Don't buy into the hype of people who give it a high rating because of the director; he might have other good films, but this isn't one of them!

    Immediately they should have hidden the money. Then call the police about the body. Then when all the investigating is over split the money. And each goes their own way. Until they meet again all prosperous. But apart from that it was a tight all suspenseful movie. Never undermine anybody! Thing is my way would not have got that guy all messed up. Love the snappy humor. Could they not have chopped the body up together? Done pieces in turns maybe? Share the responsibility. My favorite part was when under questioning the chick was asked whether she remembers people by their faces or names best. And being a nurse she says "diseases". Then the investigator says that just like her he recalls people's behavior by their crimes. I do recommend this movie.

    Danny Boyle's directorial debut remains a satisfying, stylish and twisted little black comedy thriller. It features fledgling wannabes Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston and Ewan McGregor as yuppie flatmates taking in a new lodger to share the bills. It isn't long before Hugo the lodger is found dead in bed from an overdose and the three smug and selfish twenty-somethings find themselves in possession of a suitcase full of loot. Naturally, they want the money, but what to do about Hugo? Then there's the little matter of the two gangland killers who are looking for Hugo and the dough. The scene is set for a grisly and wicked ramble through the intricate highways and byways of body disposal, murder and duplicitous double-crossing. Part thriller, part jet black satire on the corrosive dysfunction characterising Thatcher's self-centred and greed-obsessed 90s babies, Boyle has a keen eye for social comment and a scalpel sharp sense of morbid humour. There is much to enjoy, notably Eccleston's mental devolution from straight-laced and OCD accountant to paranoid and murderous loft dweller, Fox's moral dissipation to ruthless femme-fatale using sexual promiscuity to get what she wants, and McGregor's persona downturn from confident, wired and irresponsible journo to nervy and fearful potential victim in line. It's great nasty fun, with pleasingly reverent nods to Hitchcock, and the payoff (if you don't know it) is a wry little cracker. A deliciously cruel gem of a movie.

    Christopher Eccleston, Ewan McGregor and Kerry Fox give solidly disturbing leading performances as three flat mates who attempt to cover up a murder in an attempt to gain a handsome stash of cash from the victim. The plot is simple enough and the characters in the film have well developed personalities and attributes. Eccleston is particularly impressive as he begins to form a paranoid schizophrenic following guilt of the act he played a vital part in. Ewan McGregor adds a delicate essence of dark humour while Fox is a rather complex character who you never fully understand. 'Shallow Grave' is a solid thriller which has a great casting line up but many parts of the film are rather peculiar and the climax is frustrating if cleverly accomplished.

    Years prior to winning the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle directed the dark comedy, Shallow Grave. Ewan McGregor is Alex, a journalist, who along with his friends, David an accountant, and Julia, a doctor, rent a flat in Edinburgh. The fourth person has left and they place an ad for a replacement. After a series of rejections, they rent to a mysterious man named Hugo. He shortly thereafter dies of a drug overdose, and they find a large amount of cash hidden away. Human nature and greed soon take over as the three remaining tenants decide to divide the money up and hide the dearly departed's corpse in a shallow grave. That's when all the fun begins, as they struggle to find Hugo a final resting place. I would compare Boyle's work to the Coen brothers Fargo for it's grave(excuse the pun) view of the nature of man; and woman, in this case. It is both funny and violent, and a real hidden treasure.

    'Shallow Grave' marks now-Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle's directorial d&eacute;but, and also shows Hollywood actors like Ewan McGregor before they found great success. The first thing to note, then, is that those involved in 'Shallow Grave' have been propelled from this humble, independent British film to massive, big-budget blockbusters in just a few years. The second thing to note is that the plot is simple - almost too simple. However, Boyle easily keeps the excitement up, right up to (and especially) the final shot. The film is about three friends. From the first scene (a wonderful montage), it is not hard to deduce that these people are unpleasant. They trick and make fun of potential flat-mates just to fulfil their twisted, sadistic pleasures; we watch with surprising glee as they effortlessly humiliate unsuspecting Scots. However, one applicant catches their attention; an intriguing man named Hugo. When they find him dead in his new room, however, things start to get dark. Hugo came with a suitcase full of money. After deciding to take the said money, things get darker. Paranoia, suspicion and deception run riot between the three; disposing of the body makes a particularly grisly scene, despite no blood being shown; Boyle teases the viewer and creates an almost over-the-top situation. Like so much of 'Shallow Grave', it teeters on the edge of laugh-out-loud humour perfectly. The performances are top-notch; McGregor plays the unnervingly flippant Alex perfectly; Kerry Fox is brilliantly cast as the stuck-up, selfish Juliet and Christopher Eccleston is fantastic as the paranoid, sensible(ish) David. They have great chemistry together and they manage to bring sympathy to what are, in essence, horrible people. The real stars, however, are behind the camera. Boyle creates a quirky, almost surreal world, photographed with just enough satire by Brian Tufano. There are some truly ingeniously shot scenes, perhaps most notably being one involving holes in the ceiling and a frantic David. What Boyle manages to do is tear your feelings - you want them to get horribly mutilated because they are a sick bunch, but at the same time you want them to get away with it because, for reasons unbeknownst to you, you can sympathise with them. Maybe it's because you feel sorry for them being dragged into it. Maybe it's because you like mean people. Or, maybe it's because you're not sure you'd do any better. Whatever it is, you will enjoy it (and will probably argue with someone about the ending).

    Shallow Grave Danny Boyles first ever film, Shallow Grave is a solid and enjoyable thriller. The film definitely exhibits some very Boyle characteristics, from Nudity, to realism, and the film using two of Boyles preferred actors, Eccelstone and McGregor. I really enjoy this film, at 89 minutes it is a short film by most standards, yet it fits a lot of action and plot into that time. The 3 lead characters are all great, they are all supposed to be cold hearted and horrible people. The acting of Eccelstone in particular though is amazing.

I really enjoy the setting and the music in the film as well. The music, it could be said is very standard thriller stuff, but to me it adds a lot to the picture and builds up the on screen suspense well. As I say I also think the setting is good, I like the flat, and I think it certainly increases the sense of creeping madness, with the deliberately toned down colour scheme and the long spiralling staircase. I do have some criticisms, there are some obvious gaffes, on occasion there is camera or crew visible. Also the film does seem to steal a lot of it's aspects from many other thrillers, especially Psycho. I do enjoy the ending, it is certainly a surprise. I also like the small amount of ambiguity, we know enough to make assumptions about the film, but beyond the obvious it is unsure what happens. For his first film, Boyle has done a good job and he has clearly laid the foundations for Trainspotting

    At his best, Danny Boyle is one of our finest living filmmakers. And if this 1st feature isn't quite up to the level of the best of his work, it still shows one heck of a lot of talent. That said, while enjoyable and full of energy and solid performances, this didn't hold up as well on 2nd viewing as I'd hoped. This caper drama about 3 self obsessed, comically awful 20 somethings who fall into a bag of money and slowly turn on each other has a lot of dark cynical fun in it, but there are just too many logic holes and too many character leaps to be fully satisfying. A lot of the twists are clever (although some are predictable) but rather than characters evolving, they seem to lurch suddenly on their way down the rat hole to beyond forgivable. You accept the sudden transformations because they're there, but it did leave me wondering 'when did THAT suddenly happen to the character'. In turn, that underlines the film's somewhat cartoony nature, which makes sure it's never too disturbing to enjoy no matter how awfully everyone behaves, but that also robs it of the chance of being a deeper film than just a fun, smart genre exercise. With "Trainspotting" Boyle went on to find that perfect balance of surface fun, and deeper meanings, but this is a good first step.

    This singular Shallow Grave, first feature for Danny Boyle and the first of his three collaborations with Ewan McGregor, already showed in 1994 all the potential of the English director. The premise, everybody imagined at least once, is relatively simple but the script of this tragedy unfolds in an implacable way from start to finish, in an intriguing and heavy atmosphere that captivates the viewer. The characters composing this trio are complementary and each evolve differently until the ultra cynical final outcome punctuated with an unsuspected mini twist. However, the movie could be blamed for what also makes its strength, which is his absurd aspect maybe a bit too absurd. Moreover, the editing could have deserved a bit more coherence.

    "Shallow Grave" is a film by Danny Boyle from 1994, starring Kerry Fox, Ewan McGregor, and Christopher Eccleston. The three stars play roommates looking for a fourth, who put applicants through a bizarre series of questions and then laugh themselves sick afterward. They're three crazy, silly kids, McGregor is Alex, a reporter, Eccleston is David, an accountant, and Fox is Juliet, a doctor. Finally, with Fox's encouragement, they choose a fourth roommate, Hugo (Keith Allen), who is found dead in his bed. Underneath the bed is his suitcase, filled with more money than any of them have ever seen. Unbenownst to them, two men are torturing a third asking where Hugo is, and it's clear they'll stop at nothing until they find Hugo and the money. Alex decides it's best if they chop the body up and bury it sans hands, feet, and teeth. David gets the short straw and has to do the chopping, and Juliet brings the hands and feet to the hospital and disposes of them there. They roll the car into the river. At that point, the friendships begin to change, and most of all, David begins to change, and the story takes on much darker elements. Absolutely bizarre film, definitely not my type of thing, so I may not be the best person to comment on it. Boyle does a fabulous job, as do the actors, of depicting a life-changing, friendship-changing moment and the danger and terror that follows, not to mention the lack of trust and strange behavior. Extremely interesting film if you can stand all the violence. It doesn't all make sense but boy, it keeps you engrossed. I saw Danny Boyle's Frankenstein on the stage. He's a master with a fresh point of view.

    Spoiler Alert: I can tear the entire plot in half with one half-brained thought. If you know the jist of the movie, you know three people have a roommate who dies and leaves a suitcase full of money. So they decide to hack him up and bury his body? You're kidding, right? Why would anybody do that? You would just take the suitcase, put it in your room, and then call the police. BAMMMMM!!!!! End of movie! The body would be legally removed, and you would keep the money. Unfortunately, the movie just gets worse from there. It's the most predictable movie I've ever seen. It's just "Halloween" type music playing while they show some awful slow scenes. Nothing good. Save your time! Don't buy into the hype of people who give it a high rating because of the director; he might have other good films, but this isn't one of them!

    Immediately they should have hidden the money. Then call the police about the body. Then when all the investigating is over split the money. And each goes their own way. Until they meet again all prosperous. But apart from that it was a tight all suspenseful movie. Never undermine anybody! Thing is my way would not have got that guy all messed up. Love the snappy humor. Could they not have chopped the body up together? Done pieces in turns maybe? Share the responsibility. My favorite part was when under questioning the chick was asked whether she remembers people by their faces or names best. And being a nurse she says "diseases". Then the investigator says that just like her he recalls people's behavior by their crimes. I do recommend this movie.

    Danny Boyle's directorial debut remains a satisfying, stylish and twisted little black comedy thriller. It features fledgling wannabes Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston and Ewan McGregor as yuppie flatmates taking in a new lodger to share the bills. It isn't long before Hugo the lodger is found dead in bed from an overdose and the three smug and selfish twenty-somethings find themselves in possession of a suitcase full of loot. Naturally, they want the money, but what to do about Hugo? Then there's the little matter of the two gangland killers who are looking for Hugo and the dough. The scene is set for a grisly and wicked ramble through the intricate highways and byways of body disposal, murder and duplicitous double-crossing. Part thriller, part jet black satire on the corrosive dysfunction characterising Thatcher's self-centred and greed-obsessed 90s babies, Boyle has a keen eye for social comment and a scalpel sharp sense of morbid humour. There is much to enjoy, notably Eccleston's mental devolution from straight-laced and OCD accountant to paranoid and murderous loft dweller, Fox's moral dissipation to ruthless femme-fatale using sexual promiscuity to get what she wants, and McGregor's persona downturn from confident, wired and irresponsible journo to nervy and fearful potential victim in line. It's great nasty fun, with pleasingly reverent nods to Hitchcock, and the payoff (if you don't know it) is a wry little cracker. A deliciously cruel gem of a movie.

    Christopher Eccleston, Ewan McGregor and Kerry Fox give solidly disturbing leading performances as three flat mates who attempt to cover up a murder in an attempt to gain a handsome stash of cash from the victim. The plot is simple enough and the characters in the film have well developed personalities and attributes. Eccleston is particularly impressive as he begins to form a paranoid schizophrenic following guilt of the act he played a vital part in. Ewan McGregor adds a delicate essence of dark humour while Fox is a rather complex character who you never fully understand. 'Shallow Grave' is a solid thriller which has a great casting line up but many parts of the film are rather peculiar and the climax is frustrating if cleverly accomplished.

    Years prior to winning the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle directed the dark comedy, Shallow Grave. Ewan McGregor is Alex, a journalist, who along with his friends, David an accountant, and Julia, a doctor, rent a flat in Edinburgh. The fourth person has left and they place an ad for a replacement. After a series of rejections, they rent to a mysterious man named Hugo. He shortly thereafter dies of a drug overdose, and they find a large amount of cash hidden away. Human nature and greed soon take over as the three remaining tenants decide to divide the money up and hide the dearly departed's corpse in a shallow grave. That's when all the fun begins, as they struggle to find Hugo a final resting place. I would compare Boyle's work to the Coen brothers Fargo for it's grave(excuse the pun) view of the nature of man; and woman, in this case. It is both funny and violent, and a real hidden treasure.

    'Shallow Grave' marks now-Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle's directorial d&eacute;but, and also shows Hollywood actors like Ewan McGregor before they found great success. The first thing to note, then, is that those involved in 'Shallow Grave' have been propelled from this humble, independent British film to massive, big-budget blockbusters in just a few years. The second thing to note is that the plot is simple - almost too simple. However, Boyle easily keeps the excitement up, right up to (and especially) the final shot. The film is about three friends. From the first scene (a wonderful montage), it is not hard to deduce that these people are unpleasant. They trick and make fun of potential flat-mates just to fulfil their twisted, sadistic pleasures; we watch with surprising glee as they effortlessly humiliate unsuspecting Scots. However, one applicant catches their attention; an intriguing man named Hugo. When they find him dead in his new room, however, things start to get dark. Hugo came with a suitcase full of money. After deciding to take the said money, things get darker. Paranoia, suspicion and deception run riot between the three; disposing of the body makes a particularly grisly scene, despite no blood being shown; Boyle teases the viewer and creates an almost over-the-top situation. Like so much of 'Shallow Grave', it teeters on the edge of laugh-out-loud humour perfectly. The performances are top-notch; McGregor plays the unnervingly flippant Alex perfectly; Kerry Fox is brilliantly cast as the stuck-up, selfish Juliet and Christopher Eccleston is fantastic as the paranoid, sensible(ish) David. They have great chemistry together and they manage to bring sympathy to what are, in essence, horrible people. The real stars, however, are behind the camera. Boyle creates a quirky, almost surreal world, photographed with just enough satire by Brian Tufano. There are some truly ingeniously shot scenes, perhaps most notably being one involving holes in the ceiling and a frantic David. What Boyle manages to do is tear your feelings - you want them to get horribly mutilated because they are a sick bunch, but at the same time you want them to get away with it because, for reasons unbeknownst to you, you can sympathise with them. Maybe it's because you feel sorry for them being dragged into it. Maybe it's because you like mean people. Or, maybe it's because you're not sure you'd do any better. Whatever it is, you will enjoy it (and will probably argue with someone about the ending).

    Shallow Grave Danny Boyles first ever film, Shallow Grave is a solid and enjoyable thriller. The film definitely exhibits some very Boyle characteristics, from Nudity, to realism, and the film using two of Boyles preferred actors, Eccelstone and McGregor. I really enjoy this film, at 89 minutes it is a short film by most standards, yet it fits a lot of action and plot into that time. The 3 lead characters are all great, they are all supposed to be cold hearted and horrible people. The acting of Eccelstone in particular though is amazing. I really enjoy watching him going crazy on screen. I also enjoy the other characters reactions to his increasing Paranoia. Mcgregor is also good, a lot of people criticise his acting in recent years, yet I think a lot of his earlier films show that he is actually a very talented individual. I really enjoy how his two counterparts become more and more worried about what they've done, whilst it really doesn't affect him at all, until his sudden bout of self serving concern towards the end of the film.

As I say I also think the setting is good, I like the flat, and I think it certainly increases the sense of creeping madness, with the deliberately toned down colour scheme and the long spiralling staircase. I do have some criticisms, there are some obvious gaffes, on occasion there is camera or crew visible. Also the film does seem to steal a lot of it's aspects from many other thrillers, especially Psycho. I do enjoy the ending, it is certainly a surprise. I also like the small amount of ambiguity, we know enough to make assumptions about the film, but beyond the obvious it is unsure what happens. For his first film, Boyle has done a good job and he has clearly laid the foundations for Trainspotting

    At his best, Danny Boyle is one of our finest living filmmakers. And if this 1st feature isn't quite up to the level of the best of his work, it still shows one heck of a lot of talent. That said, while enjoyable and full of energy and solid performances, this didn't hold up as well on 2nd viewing as I'd hoped. This caper drama about 3 self obsessed, comically awful 20 somethings who fall into a bag of money and slowly turn on each other has a lot of dark cynical fun in it, but there are just too many logic holes and too many character leaps to be fully satisfying. A lot of the twists are clever (although some are predictable) but rather than characters evolving, they seem to lurch suddenly on their way down the rat hole to beyond forgivable. You accept the sudden transformations because they're there, but it did leave me wondering 'when did THAT suddenly happen to the character'. In turn, that underlines the film's somewhat cartoony nature, which makes sure it's never too disturbing to enjoy no matter how awfully everyone behaves, but that also robs it of the chance of being a deeper film than just a fun, smart genre exercise. With "Trainspotting" Boyle went on to find that perfect balance of surface fun, and deeper meanings, but this is a good first step.

    This singular Shallow Grave, first feature for Danny Boyle and the first of his three collaborations with Ewan McGregor, already showed in 1994 all the potential of the English director. The premise, everybody imagined at least once, is relatively simple but the script of this tragedy unfolds in an implacable way from start to finish, in an intriguing and heavy atmosphere that captivates the viewer. The characters composing this trio are complementary and each evolve differently until the ultra cynical final outcome punctuated with an unsuspected mini twist. However, the movie could be blamed for what also makes its strength, which is his absurd aspect maybe a bit too absurd. Moreover, the editing could have deserved a bit more coherence.

    "Shallow Grave" is a film by Danny Boyle from 1994, starring Kerry Fox, Ewan McGregor, and Christopher Eccleston. The three stars play roommates looking for a fourth, who put applicants through a bizarre series of questions and then laugh themselves sick afterward. They're three crazy, silly kids, McGregor is Alex, a reporter, Eccleston is David, an accountant, and Fox is Juliet, a doctor. Finally, with Fox's encouragement, they choose a fourth roommate, Hugo (Keith Allen), who is found dead in his bed. Underneath the bed is his suitcase, filled with more money than any of them have ever seen. Unbenownst to them, two men are torturing a third asking where Hugo is, and it's clear they'll stop at nothing until they find Hugo and the money. Alex decides it's best if they chop the body up and bury it sans hands, feet, and teeth. David gets the short straw and has to do the chopping, and Juliet brings the hands and feet to the hospital and disposes of them there. They roll the car into the river. At that point, the friendships begin to change, and most of all, David begins to change, and the story takes on much darker elements. Absolutely bizarre film, definitely not my type of thing, so I may not be the best person to comment on it. Boyle does a fabulous job, as do the actors, of depicting a life-changing, friendship-changing moment and the danger and terror that follows, not to mention the lack of trust and strange behavior. Extremely interesting film if you can stand all the violence. It doesn't all make sense but boy, it keeps you engrossed. I saw Danny Boyle's Frankenstein on the stage. He's a master with a fresh point of view.

    Spoiler Alert: I can tear the entire plot in half with one half-brained thought. If you know the jist of the movie, you know three people have a roommate who dies and leaves a suitcase full of money. So they decide to hack him up and bury his body? You're kidding, right? Why would anybody do that? You would just take the suitcase, put it in your room, and then call the police. BAMMMMM!!!!! End of movie! The body would be legally removed, and you would keep the money. Unfortunately, the movie just gets worse from there. It's the most predictable movie I've ever seen. It's just "Halloween" type music playing while they show some awful slow scenes. Nothing good. Save your time! Don't buy into the hype of people who give it a high rating because of the director; he might have other good films, but this isn't one of them!

    Immediately they should have hidden the money. Then call the police about the body. Then when all the investigating is over split the money. And each goes their own way. Until they meet again all prosperous. But apart from that it was a tight all suspenseful movie. Never undermine anybody! Thing is my way would not have got that guy all messed up. Love the snappy humor. Could they not have chopped the body up together? Done pieces in turns maybe? Share the responsibility. My favorite part was when under questioning the chick was asked whether she remembers people by their faces or names best. And being a nurse she says "diseases". Then the investigator says that just like her he recalls people's behavior by their crimes. I do recommend this movie.

    Danny Boyle's directorial debut remains a satisfying, stylish and twisted little black comedy thriller. It features fledgling wannabes Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston and Ewan McGregor as yuppie flatmates taking in a new lodger to share the bills. It isn't long before Hugo the lodger is found dead in bed from an overdose and the three smug and selfish twenty-somethings find themselves in possession of a suitcase full of loot. Naturally, they want the money, but what to do about Hugo? Then there's the little matter of the two gangland killers who are looking for Hugo and the dough. The scene is set for a grisly and wicked ramble through the intricate highways and byways of body disposal, murder and duplicitous double-crossing. Part thriller, part jet black satire on the corrosive dysfunction characterising Thatcher's self-centred and greed-obsessed 90s babies, Boyle has a keen eye for social comment and a scalpel sharp sense of morbid humour. There is much to enjoy, notably Eccleston's mental devolution from straight-laced and OCD accountant to paranoid and murderous loft dweller, Fox's moral dissipation to ruthless femme-fatale using sexual promiscuity to get what she wants, and McGregor's persona downturn from confident, wired and irresponsible journo to nervy and fearful potential victim in line. It's great nasty fun, with pleasingly reverent nods to Hitchcock, and the payoff (if you don't know it) is a wry little cracker. A deliciously cruel gem of a movie.

    Christopher Eccleston, Ewan McGregor and Kerry Fox give solidly disturbing leading performances as three flat mates who attempt to cover up a murder in an attempt to gain a handsome stash of cash from the victim. The plot is simple enough and the characters in the film have well developed personalities and attributes. Eccleston is particularly impressive as he begins to form a paranoid schizophrenic following guilt of the act he played a vital part in. Ewan McGregor adds a delicate essence of dark humour while Fox is a rather complex character who you never fully understand. 'Shallow Grave' is a solid thriller which has a great casting line up but many parts of the film are rather peculiar and the climax is frustrating if cleverly accomplished.

    Years prior to winning the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle directed the dark comedy, Shallow Grave. Ewan McGregor is Alex, a journalist, who along with his friends, David an accountant, and Julia, a doctor, rent a flat in Edinburgh. The fourth person has left and they place an ad for a replacement. After a series of rejections, they rent to a mysterious man named Hugo. He shortly thereafter dies of a drug overdose, and they find a large amount of cash hidden away. Human nature and greed soon take over as the three remaining tenants decide to divide the money up and hide the dearly departed's corpse in a shallow grave. That's when all the fun begins, as they struggle to find Hugo a final resting place. I would compare Boyle's work to the Coen brothers Fargo for it's grave(excuse the pun) view of the nature of man; and woman, in this case. It is both funny and violent, and a real hidden treasure.

    'Shallow Grave' marks now-Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle's directorial d&eacute;but, and also shows Hollywood actors like Ewan McGregor before they found great success. The first thing to note, then, is that those involved in 'Shallow Grave' have been propelled from this humble, independent British film to massive, big-budget blockbusters in just a few years. The second thing to note is that the plot is simple - almost too simple. However, Boyle easily keeps the excitement up, right up to (and especially) the final shot. The film is about three friends. From the first scene (a wonderful montage), it is not hard to deduce that these people are unpleasant. They trick and make fun of potential flat-mates just to fulfil their twisted, sadistic pleasures; we watch with surprising glee as they effortlessly humiliate unsuspecting Scots. However, one applicant catches their attention; an intriguing man named Hugo. When they find him dead in his new room, however, things start to get dark. Hugo came with a suitcase full of money. After deciding to take the said money, things get darker. Paranoia, suspicion and deception run riot between the three; disposing of the body makes a particularly grisly scene, despite no blood being shown; Boyle teases the viewer and creates an almost over-the-top situation. Like so much of 'Shallow Grave', it teeters on the edge of laugh-out-loud humour perfectly. The performances are top-notch; McGregor plays the unnervingly flippant Alex perfectly; Kerry Fox is brilliantly cast as the stuck-up, selfish Juliet and Christopher Eccleston is fantastic as the paranoid, sensible(ish) David. They have great chemistry together and they manage to bring sympathy to what are, in essence, horrible people. The real stars, however, are behind the camera. Boyle creates a quirky, almost surreal world, photographed with just enough satire by Brian Tufano. There are some truly ingeniously shot scenes, perhaps most notably being one involving holes in the ceiling and a frantic David. What Boyle manages to do is tear your feelings - you want them to get horribly mutilated because they are a sick bunch, but at the same time you want them to get away with it because, for reasons unbeknownst to you, you can sympathise with them. Maybe it's because you feel sorry for them being dragged into it. Maybe it's because you like mean people. Or, maybe it's because you're not sure you'd do any better. Whatever it is, you will enjoy it (and will probably argue with someone about the ending).

    Shallow Grave Danny Boyles first ever film, Shallow Grave is a solid and enjoyable thriller. The film definitely exhibits some very Boyle characteristics, from Nudity, to realism, and the film using two of Boyles preferred actors, Eccelstone and McGregor. I really enjoy this film, at 89 minutes it is a short film by most standards, yet it fits a lot of action and plot into that time. The 3 lead characters are all great, they are all supposed to be cold hearted and horrible people. The acting of Eccelstone in particular though is amazing. I really enjoy watching him going crazy on screen. I also enjoy the other characters reactions to his increasing Paranoia. Mcgregor is also good, a lot of people criticise his acting in recent years, yet I think a lot of his earlier films show that he is actually a very talented individual. I really enjoy how his two counterparts become more and more worried about what they've done, whilst it really doesn't affect him at all, until his sudden bout of self serving concern towards the end of the film. I really enjoy the setting and the music in the film as well. The music, it could be said is very standard thriller stuff, but to me it adds a lot to the picture and builds up the on screen suspense well.

Also the film does seem to steal a lot of it's aspects from many other thrillers, especially Psycho. I do enjoy the ending, it is certainly a surprise. I also like the small amount of ambiguity, we know enough to make assumptions about the film, but beyond the obvious it is unsure what happens. For his first film, Boyle has done a good job and he has clearly laid the foundations for Trainspotting
