 <sinopse>
  A homicide detective and an anthropologist try to destroy a South American lizard-like god, who's on a people eating rampage in a Chicago museum.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A researcher at Chicago's Natural History Museum returns from South America with some crates containing his findings. When the crates arrive at the museum without the owner there appears to be very little inside. However, police discover gruesome murders on the cargo ship that brought the crates to the US and then another murder in the museum itself. Investigating the murders is Lt. Vincent D'Agosta who enlists the help of Dr. Margo Green at the museum - she has taken an interest in the contents of her colleague's crates. Unknown to both there is a large creature roaming the museum which is gearing itself up for a benefit reception which the city's mayor is to attend.

The relic hasn't aged very well since the last time I saw this back in 1998, and the script doesn't hold up either. The film is basically Night At The Museum for adults, and about as entertaining. It's by the numbers stuff, museum gets dark, people get picked off every now and again, the monster isn't seen until the very end, and only two teachers from Kindergarten Cop and Tom Sizemore can save the day. If this were made today, it'd be released straight to Blu Ray and vanish without a trace. The years have been really unkind to this film. Not as good as I remember.

    A homicide detective (Tom Sizemore) and an anthropologist (Penelope Ann Miller) try to destroy a South American lizard-like god, who is on a people eating rampage in a Chicago museum. I love this film because it is humorous and there is some bizarre obsession with various kinds of coffee (mocha, espresso and latte all get mentioned at different times). And that is before it turns into a monster movie. Ebert said it "combines the conventions of the horror and disaster genres" and "is actually a lot of fun, if you like special effects and gore." Siskel called it "surprisingly entertaining", and even Leonard Maltin had to say the monster "is especially impressive." Yet, the film allegedly cost 60 million and only made 33 million at the box office, making it a flop. Perhaps if the lead had been Harrison Ford rather than Tom Sizemore, this would have drawn in the extra people (and possibly have given the film a stronger actor, with all due respect to Sizemore). I tend to side with the critics on this one -- I thought it was a lot of fun if nothing else.

    One of my guilty pleasures is the collaborative efforts of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. I chanced up a copy of "Cabinet of Curiosities," a book in the middle of their combined canon. I wondered what else they had written, and so in the middle of my more serious reading, I went back and read all their books, including the one this film is based on. It is a bit of a ripoff of the 1931 Karloff "The Mummy." Things are brought back by museum curators for a huge exhibit at the Museum of Natural History. Of course, it unleashes a horror that brings death and destruction. There is a lot of the "jump out of the shadows" stuff, but the special effects aren't bad and it is pretty engaging. The two principle characters who appear in most of the books begin a bit of a relationship here. It has the pat technique of the arrogant, self-centered, selfish people victimized first. The museum provides a neat backdrop (it has all kinds of secret places, underground heating systems, doors that haven't been opened for a long time). It's a great place for a murderous beast to ply its trade. There are several literary sequels; however, this wasn't a big money-maker and I wonder if anyone will put up the money or commitment to try again.

    After a rash of deaths in the museum, a detective and a doctor learn a smuggled, mutated lizard from South America is the culprit and must stop it before the museum's charity event draws the creature closer. Overall a rather decent entry, there's enough here to make this worthwhile. One of the best is the rather plentiful gore on display, both in quality and quantity. Beyond numerous limbs being ripped off, a series of nasty scratches and the decapitations, the fact that the scenes look really good due to the high-quality effects used, both in the prosthetics and the creature itself, this one has an overall well-rounded base to provide it's great qualities on. While in overall size and appearance the beast is a little problematic, the fact that it's still created in a great manner is a nice point about it, and the effects do look good. This one also tends to feature a bit more suspense in its attacks than expected, with several attacks being real stand-out affairs. While it does have a bit of a logic problem in most regards, from the seemingly important like the creatures' origins and the science behind it, to the trivial matters that aren't going to appear that detrimental initially, this one has a real problem and is actually enough to knock it considerably. It's still really good, but it's got a pretty big flaw to hold it down. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and a small scene of drug use.

    I remember seeing this movie in the theaters when I was 17 and enjoying it. I saw it was on Netflix instant and gave it a whirl... I'm not going to rip into this movie because it was full of clich&eacute;s, its a monster movie for goodness sake. As far as the "ancient idol/horrible monster/kill everyone around" genre goes, its not bad at all. I enjoy Tom Sizemore as an actor and while the script was what one would expect of 4 credited (and lord knows how many uncredited) screenwriters, I felt he did a good job as his character. Honestly for a movie of this type, the acting was just fine. They weren't required to do much, but that was OK. However, if you watch this movie, get used to entire scenes where you have no idea what is happening because its so dark. I understand, keep the settings dim to create fear (and realism, the power is out most of the time though why everyone in the museum works in near total darkness 99% of the time is a bit mind-boggling) but I can't be scared if I can't see what's happening when I'm supposed to! Dark, extremely dark shots keep the viewer in the (I can't do it), keep the viewer confused in many scenes. It was bad enough that a moderate length movie (109m) seemed MUCH longer and not in a good way. Much like gimmicky camera tricks or abuse of slow-motion (I'm looking at you John Woo) can ruin a movie, the overly dark nature of so many shots just leaves you sitting there wish you could tell what the hell was going on. I will say, possibly watching it on a larger screen, or a better quality television (mine is a 32" Sony LCD, nothing fancy) might mitigate lighting issues a bit, I don't know. Overall, its an OK movie for the genre that is partially ruined by not being able to tell what the hell is going on.

    I kept thinking my monitor settings were off, so I streamed it on 2 other systems (via Netflix), and still had the same results: DARK and IMPOSSIBLE to discern what the heck was going on most of the time. Oh, and in between the shadow-play, the lit scenes were just awful, making me long for the dark scenes again. What a turd of a movie. The CGI effects were sort of reminiscent of the effects in the original Predator, but every time the Klathagor (or whatever its called) beast would enter the scene, the scene lights flickered, flashed, dimmed, strobed or just went out entirely, leaving you guessing at what the gurgling screams and crunching sounds were about. Further, the camera angles were oblique at the critical moments and I kept looking at the wrong parts of the screen because the edits kept putting the beast at different locations and depths continuously. I hate chasing a movie around for 2 hours. Its an exhausting and irritating film. Did I mention that this was a turd of a movie?

    People don't hate this movie because it has bad effects, or bad acting. They hate it because it didn't stick too well to the book. But I don't know what they're complaining about It's an entertaining movie, and a lot of people hated it, and i just don't understand why. It's about a monster that runs rampid in a museum, and eats people's brains, that's it. If you wanted something more, like the meaning of life, you're not going to get it. But anyway, the film centers on a museum, which has just spent money it didn't really have on a new exhibit called superstitions. Needless to say, opening night is of the utmost importance, but the problem is, people are starting to be killed. By what, no one knows, but the murders are way to grizzly and gruesome to be human. So now it's up to Leiutnenant D'Agosta and a museum employee named Margo Green to find out what is causing the murders, and put an end to it before the opening night of the big exhibition. But despite their attempts, they find no murderer, and the exhibition opening still happens. At this point we've gathered that the killer requires nutrients from a plant that it cannot find. It just so happens that the Hyptothalamus region of the human brain also contains those nutrients. So The murderer, or monster,r because if you haven't figured out that it's a monster at this point, there's nothing to be said to you, takes to eating the museum employees brains to receive enough nutrients to survive. And with the big Exhibition opening with hundreds of people, it's pretty much a big smorgesborg for the creature. So when it attacks, a group of people get trapped in the building by a security system run awry. And now It's up to D'Agosta to get them out to safety. I'm not really going to explain anymore of the plot, because doing so would give away the twist ending, and it's also like trying to explain quantum physics in a few paragraphs that i'm far too lazy to type. But what I really want to talk about, is the comparison between the book and the movie. The Book I felt left something to be desired with the end, and a few scenes were just uneventful, like when the swat team goes into the museum. But the movie does a good job of giving the scenes more life. But it also wrote off a few good characters, and had an ending that was completely different to from the book(But i prefer the movie ending to the book ending). The monster is well made, and the movie is just good. My opinion could be different if i read the book before seeing the movie, but the only reason i wanted to read the book is because i saw the movie. Overall, a good movie that strayed pretty far from the path set by the book, but did a good job with giving some scenes better life then the book did. So I say, go check it out, see for yourself what you think.

    Even the most jaded horror movie addicts may find themselves squirming in parts of Peter Hyams' murky but well-made creature feature "The Relic" starring Penelope Ann Miller and Tom Sizemore. Meanwhile the faint of heart may want to reconsider enduring this experience. You'll lose count of the number of severed heads. You'll also lose count of the number of times that the filmmakers dare you to accompany heroes and victims down a catacomb of spooky hallways. Special effects wizard Stan Winston has created a huge, slimy, lizard critter with tusks for "The Relic" that would give "Alien," "Predator," and those "Jurassic Park" raptors a run for their money. "The Relic" is basically a haunted house chiller. Most of its grisly action occurs inside a creepy Chicago museum, within scores of shadowy corridors, labs, and staircases. A dinosaur reptile of amazing agility prowls these premises and feasts on flesh. Mainly, this hybrid monster tears your head off and munches a chunk of your brains. The melodramatic script pays homage to scary sagas such as "Jaws," "Alien," and "Jurassic Park." Penelope Ann Miller plays a dedicated but cute evolutionary biologist who pedals a bicycle to work and worries about who'll fund her research. She shares many of Ripley's heroic characteristics from the "Alien" franchise, except Penelope doesn't perform a strip tease for the monster. She keeps her clothes on and relies on her wits to outsmart the creature. Burly Tom Sizemore abets her as a superstitious Windy City cop. He wants to close the museum, but the mayor needs it open for a gala fund raiser. Naturally, the monster crashes the gala and heads roll. When the monster isn't terrifying the rich, the museum becomes an obstacle course. The monsters shuts down the power, and the wealthy patrons find themselves trapped in the dark, rained on by fire sprinklers. "The Relic" aspires to be more than just a horror movie. The worst thing about "The Relic" is its surplus of plot. What might have been a small horror movie turns into not only a big-scale scary movie, but also a disaster movie. The film opens with a jungle witchcraft scene that is supposed to frighten but winds up being incomprehensible. The filmmakers then build the plot and introduce their array of characters before the finally unleash the beast. Part of the time the scenarists clobber us with a load of scientific, computer gibberish that makes the movie sound realistic. Interestingly, everything that the monster devours becomes part of its DNA and guides it behavior. Peter Hyams lights the museum as if it were the space ship in "Alien." Hyams, who helmed "Outland" and "Running Scared," aims to scare the daylights out of you. He resorts to every tried-and-true truck to elicit paranoia and hype suspense. If you aren't family with how horror movies manipulate their audiences, you may find some scenes in "The Relic" a little intense. Predictability, of course, paralyzes the plot because Hyams spends too much time trying to be like other horror movies so that it breaks little new ground. But the effects may be gruesome enough that you forget the formula that the story follows. Hyams gets great help from composer John Debney whose tense, dramatic orchestral score heightens the tension. "The Relic" qualifies as a good horror movie boosted by glossy production values. This chiller is worth seeing at least once while you're searching for a genuine classic.

    After cargo from South America find its way to the Chicago Museum Of Natural History Sans owner, a series of brutal murders happen drawing the suspicions of Lt. Vincent (Tom Sizemore) who teams up with Margo (Penelope Ann Miller),a researcher at said museum who has some unanswered questions of her own, to find out what they're dealing with. First of all, let me get this out of the way. This movie is atrociously lit, so much so that if you're not watching it in a completely darkened room you'll be straining to see what's going on in some key scenes (and even then...). Despite this one, admittedly major gripe, the film was serviceable enough and a fun b-movie creature-feature IF you haven't read the far superior book before hand. If you have, your results may vary greatly. My Grade: D+ (the lighting subtracted a letter grade for me)

    "The Relic" is a film that will make you jump and squirm in your seat, it's THAT good. What results (in the novel and film) is a grotesque reptilian-mammalian creature that decapitates its victims and devours the one part of the victim's body that can supply the creature with the missing hormonal concoction: the human hypothalamus. Taking place mainly in the fictional "Natural History Museum of Chicago", the film offers viewers what goes on behind museum walls, like that museums only show about 2% of their collections that can sometimes reach numbers in the millions, or that the common domestic beetle cleans carcasses of their flesh in preparation for taxidermy. Aside from the educational aspects, the film also offers some of the most complicated human-creature interaction scenes ever filmed, as well as breath-taking visual and creature effects, most of them more complicated than the "Jurassic Park" series's scenes. The film also shows some of the most visually disturbing images (many which were cut from the final picture), like 2 on screen decapitations, and bodies being severed in two (please keep in mind though, all these scenes are done in taste, as opposed to the more famous "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Friday the 13th" series.) And even if you don't include the gore, just the lighting and ambiance of the film is eerie in itself. Other films, when attempting to show a "dark" scene, light up the picture with blue lights, allowing the audience to see the advisory right behind the main characters. In "The Relic" though, most of the scenes are lit only by a flashlight, allowing the audience to see only what the characters see. "The Relic", even though it did not get many good reviews, is an excellent film that gives you many thrills in under two hours. By the time the film is over, and if you're really into it, I guarantee that your pulse will be up by about 20 more beats per minute.

But anyway, the film centers on a museum, which has just spent money it didn't really have on a new exhibit called superstitions. Needless to say, opening night is of the utmost importance, but the problem is, people are starting to be killed. By what, no one knows, but the murders are way to grizzly and gruesome to be human. So now it's up to Leiutnenant D'Agosta and a museum employee named Margo Green to find out what is causing the murders, and put an end to it before the opening night of the big exhibition. But despite their attempts, they find no murderer, and the exhibition opening still happens. At this point we've gathered that the killer requires nutrients from a plant that it cannot find. It just so happens that the Hyptothalamus region of the human brain also contains those nutrients. So The murderer, or monster,r because if you haven't figured out that it's a monster at this point, there's nothing to be said to you, takes to eating the museum employees brains to receive enough nutrients to survive. And with the big Exhibition opening with hundreds of people, it's pretty much a big smorgesborg for the creature. So when it attacks, a group of people get trapped in the building by a security system run awry. And now It's up to D'Agosta to get them out to safety. I'm not really going to explain anymore of the plot, because doing so would give away the twist ending, and it's also like trying to explain quantum physics in a few paragraphs that i'm far too lazy to type. But what I really want to talk about, is the comparison between the book and the movie. The Book I felt left something to be desired with the end, and a few scenes were just uneventful, like when the swat team goes into the museum. But the movie does a good job of giving the scenes more life. But it also wrote off a few good characters, and had an ending that was completely different to from the book(But i prefer the movie ending to the book ending). The monster is well made, and the movie is just good. My opinion could be different if i read the book before seeing the movie, but the only reason i wanted to read the book is because i saw the movie. Overall, a good movie that strayed pretty far from the path set by the book, but did a good job with giving some scenes better life then the book did. So I say, go check it out, see for yourself what you think.

    Even the most jaded horror movie addicts may find themselves squirming in parts of Peter Hyams' murky but well-made creature feature "The Relic" starring Penelope Ann Miller and Tom Sizemore. Meanwhile the faint of heart may want to reconsider enduring this experience. You'll lose count of the number of severed heads. You'll also lose count of the number of times that the filmmakers dare you to accompany heroes and victims down a catacomb of spooky hallways. Special effects wizard Stan Winston has created a huge, slimy, lizard critter with tusks for "The Relic" that would give "Alien," "Predator," and those "Jurassic Park" raptors a run for their money. "The Relic" is basically a haunted house chiller. Most of its grisly action occurs inside a creepy Chicago museum, within scores of shadowy corridors, labs, and staircases. A dinosaur reptile of amazing agility prowls these premises and feasts on flesh. Mainly, this hybrid monster tears your head off and munches a chunk of your brains. The melodramatic script pays homage to scary sagas such as "Jaws," "Alien," and "Jurassic Park." Penelope Ann Miller plays a dedicated but cute evolutionary biologist who pedals a bicycle to work and worries about who'll fund her research. She shares many of Ripley's heroic characteristics from the "Alien" franchise, except Penelope doesn't perform a strip tease for the monster. She keeps her clothes on and relies on her wits to outsmart the creature. Burly Tom Sizemore abets her as a superstitious Windy City cop. He wants to close the museum, but the mayor needs it open for a gala fund raiser. Naturally, the monster crashes the gala and heads roll. When the monster isn't terrifying the rich, the museum becomes an obstacle course. The monsters shuts down the power, and the wealthy patrons find themselves trapped in the dark, rained on by fire sprinklers. "The Relic" aspires to be more than just a horror movie. The worst thing about "The Relic" is its surplus of plot. What might have been a small horror movie turns into not only a big-scale scary movie, but also a disaster movie. The film opens with a jungle witchcraft scene that is supposed to frighten but winds up being incomprehensible. The filmmakers then build the plot and introduce their array of characters before the finally unleash the beast. Part of the time the scenarists clobber us with a load of scientific, computer gibberish that makes the movie sound realistic. Interestingly, everything that the monster devours becomes part of its DNA and guides it behavior. Peter Hyams lights the museum as if it were the space ship in "Alien." Hyams, who helmed "Outland" and "Running Scared," aims to scare the daylights out of you. He resorts to every tried-and-true truck to elicit paranoia and hype suspense. If you aren't family with how horror movies manipulate their audiences, you may find some scenes in "The Relic" a little intense. Predictability, of course, paralyzes the plot because Hyams spends too much time trying to be like other horror movies so that it breaks little new ground. But the effects may be gruesome enough that you forget the formula that the story follows. Hyams gets great help from composer John Debney whose tense, dramatic orchestral score heightens the tension. "The Relic" qualifies as a good horror movie boosted by glossy production values. This chiller is worth seeing at least once while you're searching for a genuine classic.

    After cargo from South America find its way to the Chicago Museum Of Natural History Sans owner, a series of brutal murders happen drawing the suspicions of Lt. Vincent (Tom Sizemore) who teams up with Margo (Penelope Ann Miller),a researcher at said museum who has some unanswered questions of her own, to find out what they're dealing with. First of all, let me get this out of the way. This movie is atrociously lit, so much so that if you're not watching it in a completely darkened room you'll be straining to see what's going on in some key scenes (and even then...). Despite this one, admittedly major gripe, the film was serviceable enough and a fun b-movie creature-feature IF you haven't read the far superior book before hand. If you have, your results may vary greatly. My Grade: D+ (the lighting subtracted a letter grade for me)

    "The Relic" is a film that will make you jump and squirm in your seat, it's THAT good. What results (in the novel and film) is a grotesque reptilian-mammalian creature that decapitates its victims and devours the one part of the victim's body that can supply the creature with the missing hormonal concoction: the human hypothalamus. Taking place mainly in the fictional "Natural History Museum of Chicago", the film offers viewers what goes on behind museum walls, like that museums only show about 2% of their collections that can sometimes reach numbers in the millions, or that the common domestic beetle cleans carcasses of their flesh in preparation for taxidermy. Aside from the educational aspects, the film also offers some of the most complicated human-creature interaction scenes ever filmed, as well as breath-taking visual and creature effects, most of them more complicated than the "Jurassic Park" series's scenes. The film also shows some of the most visually disturbing images (many which were cut from the final picture), like 2 on screen decapitations, and bodies being severed in two (please keep in mind though, all these scenes are done in taste, as opposed to the more famous "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Friday the 13th" series.) And even if you don't include the gore, just the lighting and ambiance of the film is eerie in itself. Other films, when attempting to show a "dark" scene, light up the picture with blue lights, allowing the audience to see the advisory right behind the main characters. In "The Relic" though, most of the scenes are lit only by a flashlight, allowing the audience to see only what the characters see. "The Relic", even though it did not get many good reviews, is an excellent film that gives you many thrills in under two hours. By the time the film is over, and if you're really into it, I guarantee that your pulse will be up by about 20 more beats per minute.

    A researcher at Chicago's Natural History Museum returns from South America with crates containing his findings. When they arrive at the museum without the owner there appears to be very little inside. Police discover gruesome remains on the cargo ship that brought the crates, and then another murder in the museum itself. Investigating the murder is Lt. D'Agosta who enlists the help of Dr. Green at the museum. Unknown to both though, there is a large creature roaming the museum, which is preparing itself for a benefit reception...... The relic hasn't aged very well since the last time I saw this back in 1998, and the script doesn't hold up either. The film is basically Night At The Museum for adults, and about as entertaining. It's by the numbers stuff, museum gets dark, people get picked off every now and again, the monster isn't seen until the very end, and only two teachers from Kindergarten Cop and Tom Sizemore can save the day. If this were made today, it'd be released straight to Blu Ray and vanish without a trace. The years have been really unkind to this film. Not as good as I remember.

    A homicide detective (Tom Sizemore) and an anthropologist (Penelope Ann Miller) try to destroy a South American lizard-like god, who is on a people eating rampage in a Chicago museum. I love this film because it is humorous and there is some bizarre obsession with various kinds of coffee (mocha, espresso and latte all get mentioned at different times). And that is before it turns into a monster movie. Ebert said it "combines the conventions of the horror and disaster genres" and "is actually a lot of fun, if you like special effects and gore." Siskel called it "surprisingly entertaining", and even Leonard Maltin had to say the monster "is especially impressive." Yet, the film allegedly cost 60 million and only made 33 million at the box office, making it a flop. Perhaps if the lead had been Harrison Ford rather than Tom Sizemore, this would have drawn in the extra people (and possibly have given the film a stronger actor, with all due respect to Sizemore). I tend to side with the critics on this one -- I thought it was a lot of fun if nothing else.

    One of my guilty pleasures is the collaborative efforts of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. I chanced up a copy of "Cabinet of Curiosities," a book in the middle of their combined canon. I wondered what else they had written, and so in the middle of my more serious reading, I went back and read all their books, including the one this film is based on. It is a bit of a ripoff of the 1931 Karloff "The Mummy." Things are brought back by museum curators for a huge exhibit at the Museum of Natural History. Of course, it unleashes a horror that brings death and destruction. There is a lot of the "jump out of the shadows" stuff, but the special effects aren't bad and it is pretty engaging. The two principle characters who appear in most of the books begin a bit of a relationship here. It has the pat technique of the arrogant, self-centered, selfish people victimized first. The museum provides a neat backdrop (it has all kinds of secret places, underground heating systems, doors that haven't been opened for a long time). It's a great place for a murderous beast to ply its trade. There are several literary sequels; however, this wasn't a big money-maker and I wonder if anyone will put up the money or commitment to try again.

    After a rash of deaths in the museum, a detective and a doctor learn a smuggled, mutated lizard from South America is the culprit and must stop it before the museum's charity event draws the creature closer. Overall a rather decent entry, there's enough here to make this worthwhile. One of the best is the rather plentiful gore on display, both in quality and quantity. Beyond numerous limbs being ripped off, a series of nasty scratches and the decapitations, the fact that the scenes look really good due to the high-quality effects used, both in the prosthetics and the creature itself, this one has an overall well-rounded base to provide it's great qualities on. While in overall size and appearance the beast is a little problematic, the fact that it's still created in a great manner is a nice point about it, and the effects do look good. This one also tends to feature a bit more suspense in its attacks than expected, with several attacks being real stand-out affairs. While it does have a bit of a logic problem in most regards, from the seemingly important like the creatures' origins and the science behind it, to the trivial matters that aren't going to appear that detrimental initially, this one has a real problem and is actually enough to knock it considerably. It's still really good, but it's got a pretty big flaw to hold it down. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and a small scene of drug use.

    I remember seeing this movie in the theaters when I was 17 and enjoying it. I saw it was on Netflix instant and gave it a whirl... I'm not going to rip into this movie because it was full of clich&eacute;s, its a monster movie for goodness sake. As far as the "ancient idol/horrible monster/kill everyone around" genre goes, its not bad at all. I enjoy Tom Sizemore as an actor and while the script was what one would expect of 4 credited (and lord knows how many uncredited) screenwriters, I felt he did a good job as his character. Honestly for a movie of this type, the acting was just fine. They weren't required to do much, but that was OK. However, if you watch this movie, get used to entire scenes where you have no idea what is happening because its so dark. I understand, keep the settings dim to create fear (and realism, the power is out most of the time though why everyone in the museum works in near total darkness 99% of the time is a bit mind-boggling) but I can't be scared if I can't see what's happening when I'm supposed to! Dark, extremely dark shots keep the viewer in the (I can't do it), keep the viewer confused in many scenes. It was bad enough that a moderate length movie (109m) seemed MUCH longer and not in a good way. Much like gimmicky camera tricks or abuse of slow-motion (I'm looking at you John Woo) can ruin a movie, the overly dark nature of so many shots just leaves you sitting there wish you could tell what the hell was going on. I will say, possibly watching it on a larger screen, or a better quality television (mine is a 32" Sony LCD, nothing fancy) might mitigate lighting issues a bit, I don't know. Overall, its an OK movie for the genre that is partially ruined by not being able to tell what the hell is going on.

    I kept thinking my monitor settings were off, so I streamed it on 2 other systems (via Netflix), and still had the same results: DARK and IMPOSSIBLE to discern what the heck was going on most of the time. Oh, and in between the shadow-play, the lit scenes were just awful, making me long for the dark scenes again. What a turd of a movie. The CGI effects were sort of reminiscent of the effects in the original Predator, but every time the Klathagor (or whatever its called) beast would enter the scene, the scene lights flickered, flashed, dimmed, strobed or just went out entirely, leaving you guessing at what the gurgling screams and crunching sounds were about. Further, the camera angles were oblique at the critical moments and I kept looking at the wrong parts of the screen because the edits kept putting the beast at different locations and depths continuously. I hate chasing a movie around for 2 hours. Its an exhausting and irritating film. Did I mention that this was a turd of a movie?

    People don't hate this movie because it has bad effects, or bad acting. They hate it because it didn't stick too well to the book. But I don't know what they're complaining about It's an entertaining movie, and a lot of people hated it, and i just don't understand why.

I wondered what else they had written, and so in the middle of my more serious reading, I went back and read all their books, including the one this film is based on. It is a bit of a ripoff of the 1931 Karloff "The Mummy." Things are brought back by museum curators for a huge exhibit at the Museum of Natural History. Of course, it unleashes a horror that brings death and destruction. There is a lot of the "jump out of the shadows" stuff, but the special effects aren't bad and it is pretty engaging. The two principle characters who appear in most of the books begin a bit of a relationship here. It has the pat technique of the arrogant, self-centered, selfish people victimized first. The museum provides a neat backdrop (it has all kinds of secret places, underground heating systems, doors that haven't been opened for a long time). It's a great place for a murderous beast to ply its trade. There are several literary sequels; however, this wasn't a big money-maker and I wonder if anyone will put up the money or commitment to try again.

    After a rash of deaths in the museum, a detective and a doctor learn a smuggled, mutated lizard from South America is the culprit and must stop it before the museum's charity event draws the creature closer. Overall a rather decent entry, there's enough here to make this worthwhile. One of the best is the rather plentiful gore on display, both in quality and quantity. Beyond numerous limbs being ripped off, a series of nasty scratches and the decapitations, the fact that the scenes look really good due to the high-quality effects used, both in the prosthetics and the creature itself, this one has an overall well-rounded base to provide it's great qualities on. While in overall size and appearance the beast is a little problematic, the fact that it's still created in a great manner is a nice point about it, and the effects do look good. This one also tends to feature a bit more suspense in its attacks than expected, with several attacks being real stand-out affairs. While it does have a bit of a logic problem in most regards, from the seemingly important like the creatures' origins and the science behind it, to the trivial matters that aren't going to appear that detrimental initially, this one has a real problem and is actually enough to knock it considerably. It's still really good, but it's got a pretty big flaw to hold it down. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and a small scene of drug use.

    I remember seeing this movie in the theaters when I was 17 and enjoying it. I saw it was on Netflix instant and gave it a whirl... I'm not going to rip into this movie because it was full of clich&eacute;s, its a monster movie for goodness sake. As far as the "ancient idol/horrible monster/kill everyone around" genre goes, its not bad at all. I enjoy Tom Sizemore as an actor and while the script was what one would expect of 4 credited (and lord knows how many uncredited) screenwriters, I felt he did a good job as his character. Honestly for a movie of this type, the acting was just fine. They weren't required to do much, but that was OK. However, if you watch this movie, get used to entire scenes where you have no idea what is happening because its so dark. I understand, keep the settings dim to create fear (and realism, the power is out most of the time though why everyone in the museum works in near total darkness 99% of the time is a bit mind-boggling) but I can't be scared if I can't see what's happening when I'm supposed to! Dark, extremely dark shots keep the viewer in the (I can't do it), keep the viewer confused in many scenes. It was bad enough that a moderate length movie (109m) seemed MUCH longer and not in a good way. Much like gimmicky camera tricks or abuse of slow-motion (I'm looking at you John Woo) can ruin a movie, the overly dark nature of so many shots just leaves you sitting there wish you could tell what the hell was going on. I will say, possibly watching it on a larger screen, or a better quality television (mine is a 32" Sony LCD, nothing fancy) might mitigate lighting issues a bit, I don't know. Overall, its an OK movie for the genre that is partially ruined by not being able to tell what the hell is going on.

    I kept thinking my monitor settings were off, so I streamed it on 2 other systems (via Netflix), and still had the same results: DARK and IMPOSSIBLE to discern what the heck was going on most of the time. Oh, and in between the shadow-play, the lit scenes were just awful, making me long for the dark scenes again. What a turd of a movie. The CGI effects were sort of reminiscent of the effects in the original Predator, but every time the Klathagor (or whatever its called) beast would enter the scene, the scene lights flickered, flashed, dimmed, strobed or just went out entirely, leaving you guessing at what the gurgling screams and crunching sounds were about. Further, the camera angles were oblique at the critical moments and I kept looking at the wrong parts of the screen because the edits kept putting the beast at different locations and depths continuously. I hate chasing a movie around for 2 hours. Its an exhausting and irritating film. Did I mention that this was a turd of a movie?

    People don't hate this movie because it has bad effects, or bad acting. They hate it because it didn't stick too well to the book. But I don't know what they're complaining about It's an entertaining movie, and a lot of people hated it, and i just don't understand why. It's about a monster that runs rampid in a museum, and eats people's brains, that's it. If you wanted something more, like the meaning of life, you're not going to get it. But anyway, the film centers on a museum, which has just spent money it didn't really have on a new exhibit called superstitions. Needless to say, opening night is of the utmost importance, but the problem is, people are starting to be killed. By what, no one knows, but the murders are way to grizzly and gruesome to be human. So now it's up to Leiutnenant D'Agosta and a museum employee named Margo Green to find out what is causing the murders, and put an end to it before the opening night of the big exhibition. But despite their attempts, they find no murderer, and the exhibition opening still happens. At this point we've gathered that the killer requires nutrients from a plant that it cannot find. It just so happens that the Hyptothalamus region of the human brain also contains those nutrients. So The murderer, or monster,r because if you haven't figured out that it's a monster at this point, there's nothing to be said to you, takes to eating the museum employees brains to receive enough nutrients to survive. And with the big Exhibition opening with hundreds of people, it's pretty much a big smorgesborg for the creature. So when it attacks, a group of people get trapped in the building by a security system run awry. And now It's up to D'Agosta to get them out to safety. I'm not really going to explain anymore of the plot, because doing so would give away the twist ending, and it's also like trying to explain quantum physics in a few paragraphs that i'm far too lazy to type. But what I really want to talk about, is the comparison between the book and the movie. The Book I felt left something to be desired with the end, and a few scenes were just uneventful, like when the swat team goes into the museum. But the movie does a good job of giving the scenes more life. But it also wrote off a few good characters, and had an ending that was completely different to from the book(But i prefer the movie ending to the book ending). The monster is well made, and the movie is just good. My opinion could be different if i read the book before seeing the movie, but the only reason i wanted to read the book is because i saw the movie. Overall, a good movie that strayed pretty far from the path set by the book, but did a good job with giving some scenes better life then the book did. So I say, go check it out, see for yourself what you think.

    Even the most jaded horror movie addicts may find themselves squirming in parts of Peter Hyams' murky but well-made creature feature "The Relic" starring Penelope Ann Miller and Tom Sizemore. Meanwhile the faint of heart may want to reconsider enduring this experience. You'll lose count of the number of severed heads. You'll also lose count of the number of times that the filmmakers dare you to accompany heroes and victims down a catacomb of spooky hallways. Special effects wizard Stan Winston has created a huge, slimy, lizard critter with tusks for "The Relic" that would give "Alien," "Predator," and those "Jurassic Park" raptors a run for their money. "The Relic" is basically a haunted house chiller. Most of its grisly action occurs inside a creepy Chicago museum, within scores of shadowy corridors, labs, and staircases. A dinosaur reptile of amazing agility prowls these premises and feasts on flesh. Mainly, this hybrid monster tears your head off and munches a chunk of your brains. The melodramatic script pays homage to scary sagas such as "Jaws," "Alien," and "Jurassic Park." Penelope Ann Miller plays a dedicated but cute evolutionary biologist who pedals a bicycle to work and worries about who'll fund her research. She shares many of Ripley's heroic characteristics from the "Alien" franchise, except Penelope doesn't perform a strip tease for the monster. She keeps her clothes on and relies on her wits to outsmart the creature. Burly Tom Sizemore abets her as a superstitious Windy City cop. He wants to close the museum, but the mayor needs it open for a gala fund raiser. Naturally, the monster crashes the gala and heads roll. When the monster isn't terrifying the rich, the museum becomes an obstacle course. The monsters shuts down the power, and the wealthy patrons find themselves trapped in the dark, rained on by fire sprinklers. "The Relic" aspires to be more than just a horror movie. The worst thing about "The Relic" is its surplus of plot. What might have been a small horror movie turns into not only a big-scale scary movie, but also a disaster movie. The film opens with a jungle witchcraft scene that is supposed to frighten but winds up being incomprehensible. The filmmakers then build the plot and introduce their array of characters before the finally unleash the beast. Part of the time the scenarists clobber us with a load of scientific, computer gibberish that makes the movie sound realistic. Interestingly, everything that the monster devours becomes part of its DNA and guides it behavior. Peter Hyams lights the museum as if it were the space ship in "Alien." Hyams, who helmed "Outland" and "Running Scared," aims to scare the daylights out of you. He resorts to every tried-and-true truck to elicit paranoia and hype suspense. If you aren't family with how horror movies manipulate their audiences, you may find some scenes in "The Relic" a little intense. Predictability, of course, paralyzes the plot because Hyams spends too much time trying to be like other horror movies so that it breaks little new ground. But the effects may be gruesome enough that you forget the formula that the story follows. Hyams gets great help from composer John Debney whose tense, dramatic orchestral score heightens the tension. "The Relic" qualifies as a good horror movie boosted by glossy production values. This chiller is worth seeing at least once while you're searching for a genuine classic.

    After cargo from South America find its way to the Chicago Museum Of Natural History Sans owner, a series of brutal murders happen drawing the suspicions of Lt. Vincent (Tom Sizemore) who teams up with Margo (Penelope Ann Miller),a researcher at said museum who has some unanswered questions of her own, to find out what they're dealing with. First of all, let me get this out of the way. This movie is atrociously lit, so much so that if you're not watching it in a completely darkened room you'll be straining to see what's going on in some key scenes (and even then...). Despite this one, admittedly major gripe, the film was serviceable enough and a fun b-movie creature-feature IF you haven't read the far superior book before hand. If you have, your results may vary greatly. My Grade: D+ (the lighting subtracted a letter grade for me)

    "The Relic" is a film that will make you jump and squirm in your seat, it's THAT good. What results (in the novel and film) is a grotesque reptilian-mammalian creature that decapitates its victims and devours the one part of the victim's body that can supply the creature with the missing hormonal concoction: the human hypothalamus. Taking place mainly in the fictional "Natural History Museum of Chicago", the film offers viewers what goes on behind museum walls, like that museums only show about 2% of their collections that can sometimes reach numbers in the millions, or that the common domestic beetle cleans carcasses of their flesh in preparation for taxidermy. Aside from the educational aspects, the film also offers some of the most complicated human-creature interaction scenes ever filmed, as well as breath-taking visual and creature effects, most of them more complicated than the "Jurassic Park" series's scenes. The film also shows some of the most visually disturbing images (many which were cut from the final picture), like 2 on screen decapitations, and bodies being severed in two (please keep in mind though, all these scenes are done in taste, as opposed to the more famous "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Friday the 13th" series.) And even if you don't include the gore, just the lighting and ambiance of the film is eerie in itself. Other films, when attempting to show a "dark" scene, light up the picture with blue lights, allowing the audience to see the advisory right behind the main characters. In "The Relic" though, most of the scenes are lit only by a flashlight, allowing the audience to see only what the characters see. "The Relic", even though it did not get many good reviews, is an excellent film that gives you many thrills in under two hours. By the time the film is over, and if you're really into it, I guarantee that your pulse will be up by about 20 more beats per minute.

    A researcher at Chicago's Natural History Museum returns from South America with crates containing his findings. When they arrive at the museum without the owner there appears to be very little inside. Police discover gruesome remains on the cargo ship that brought the crates, and then another murder in the museum itself. Investigating the murder is Lt. D'Agosta who enlists the help of Dr. Green at the museum. Unknown to both though, there is a large creature roaming the museum, which is preparing itself for a benefit reception...... The relic hasn't aged very well since the last time I saw this back in 1998, and the script doesn't hold up either. The film is basically Night At The Museum for adults, and about as entertaining. It's by the numbers stuff, museum gets dark, people get picked off every now and again, the monster isn't seen until the very end, and only two teachers from Kindergarten Cop and Tom Sizemore can save the day. If this were made today, it'd be released straight to Blu Ray and vanish without a trace. The years have been really unkind to this film. Not as good as I remember.

    A homicide detective (Tom Sizemore) and an anthropologist (Penelope Ann Miller) try to destroy a South American lizard-like god, who is on a people eating rampage in a Chicago museum. I love this film because it is humorous and there is some bizarre obsession with various kinds of coffee (mocha, espresso and latte all get mentioned at different times). And that is before it turns into a monster movie. Ebert said it "combines the conventions of the horror and disaster genres" and "is actually a lot of fun, if you like special effects and gore." Siskel called it "surprisingly entertaining", and even Leonard Maltin had to say the monster "is especially impressive." Yet, the film allegedly cost 60 million and only made 33 million at the box office, making it a flop. Perhaps if the lead had been Harrison Ford rather than Tom Sizemore, this would have drawn in the extra people (and possibly have given the film a stronger actor, with all due respect to Sizemore). I tend to side with the critics on this one -- I thought it was a lot of fun if nothing else.

This chiller is worth seeing at least once while you're searching for a genuine classic.

    After cargo from South America find its way to the Chicago Museum Of Natural History Sans owner, a series of brutal murders happen drawing the suspicions of Lt. Vincent (Tom Sizemore) who teams up with Margo (Penelope Ann Miller),a researcher at said museum who has some unanswered questions of her own, to find out what they're dealing with. First of all, let me get this out of the way. This movie is atrociously lit, so much so that if you're not watching it in a completely darkened room you'll be straining to see what's going on in some key scenes (and even then...). Despite this one, admittedly major gripe, the film was serviceable enough and a fun b-movie creature-feature IF you haven't read the far superior book before hand. If you have, your results may vary greatly. My Grade: D+ (the lighting subtracted a letter grade for me)

    "The Relic" is a film that will make you jump and squirm in your seat, it's THAT good. What results (in the novel and film) is a grotesque reptilian-mammalian creature that decapitates its victims and devours the one part of the victim's body that can supply the creature with the missing hormonal concoction: the human hypothalamus. Taking place mainly in the fictional "Natural History Museum of Chicago", the film offers viewers what goes on behind museum walls, like that museums only show about 2% of their collections that can sometimes reach numbers in the millions, or that the common domestic beetle cleans carcasses of their flesh in preparation for taxidermy. Aside from the educational aspects, the film also offers some of the most complicated human-creature interaction scenes ever filmed, as well as breath-taking visual and creature effects, most of them more complicated than the "Jurassic Park" series's scenes. The film also shows some of the most visually disturbing images (many which were cut from the final picture), like 2 on screen decapitations, and bodies being severed in two (please keep in mind though, all these scenes are done in taste, as opposed to the more famous "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Friday the 13th" series.) And even if you don't include the gore, just the lighting and ambiance of the film is eerie in itself. Other films, when attempting to show a "dark" scene, light up the picture with blue lights, allowing the audience to see the advisory right behind the main characters. In "The Relic" though, most of the scenes are lit only by a flashlight, allowing the audience to see only what the characters see. "The Relic", even though it did not get many good reviews, is an excellent film that gives you many thrills in under two hours. By the time the film is over, and if you're really into it, I guarantee that your pulse will be up by about 20 more beats per minute.

    A researcher at Chicago's Natural History Museum returns from South America with crates containing his findings. When they arrive at the museum without the owner there appears to be very little inside. Police discover gruesome remains on the cargo ship that brought the crates, and then another murder in the museum itself. Investigating the murder is Lt. D'Agosta who enlists the help of Dr. Green at the museum. Unknown to both though, there is a large creature roaming the museum, which is preparing itself for a benefit reception...... The relic hasn't aged very well since the last time I saw this back in 1998, and the script doesn't hold up either. The film is basically Night At The Museum for adults, and about as entertaining. It's by the numbers stuff, museum gets dark, people get picked off every now and again, the monster isn't seen until the very end, and only two teachers from Kindergarten Cop and Tom Sizemore can save the day. If this were made today, it'd be released straight to Blu Ray and vanish without a trace. The years have been really unkind to this film. Not as good as I remember.

    A homicide detective (Tom Sizemore) and an anthropologist (Penelope Ann Miller) try to destroy a South American lizard-like god, who is on a people eating rampage in a Chicago museum. I love this film because it is humorous and there is some bizarre obsession with various kinds of coffee (mocha, espresso and latte all get mentioned at different times). And that is before it turns into a monster movie. Ebert said it "combines the conventions of the horror and disaster genres" and "is actually a lot of fun, if you like special effects and gore." Siskel called it "surprisingly entertaining", and even Leonard Maltin had to say the monster "is especially impressive." Yet, the film allegedly cost 60 million and only made 33 million at the box office, making it a flop. Perhaps if the lead had been Harrison Ford rather than Tom Sizemore, this would have drawn in the extra people (and possibly have given the film a stronger actor, with all due respect to Sizemore). I tend to side with the critics on this one -- I thought it was a lot of fun if nothing else.

    One of my guilty pleasures is the collaborative efforts of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. I chanced up a copy of "Cabinet of Curiosities," a book in the middle of their combined canon. I wondered what else they had written, and so in the middle of my more serious reading, I went back and read all their books, including the one this film is based on. It is a bit of a ripoff of the 1931 Karloff "The Mummy." Things are brought back by museum curators for a huge exhibit at the Museum of Natural History. Of course, it unleashes a horror that brings death and destruction. There is a lot of the "jump out of the shadows" stuff, but the special effects aren't bad and it is pretty engaging. The two principle characters who appear in most of the books begin a bit of a relationship here. It has the pat technique of the arrogant, self-centered, selfish people victimized first. The museum provides a neat backdrop (it has all kinds of secret places, underground heating systems, doors that haven't been opened for a long time). It's a great place for a murderous beast to ply its trade. There are several literary sequels; however, this wasn't a big money-maker and I wonder if anyone will put up the money or commitment to try again.

    After a rash of deaths in the museum, a detective and a doctor learn a smuggled, mutated lizard from South America is the culprit and must stop it before the museum's charity event draws the creature closer. Overall a rather decent entry, there's enough here to make this worthwhile. One of the best is the rather plentiful gore on display, both in quality and quantity. Beyond numerous limbs being ripped off, a series of nasty scratches and the decapitations, the fact that the scenes look really good due to the high-quality effects used, both in the prosthetics and the creature itself, this one has an overall well-rounded base to provide it's great qualities on. While in overall size and appearance the beast is a little problematic, the fact that it's still created in a great manner is a nice point about it, and the effects do look good. This one also tends to feature a bit more suspense in its attacks than expected, with several attacks being real stand-out affairs. While it does have a bit of a logic problem in most regards, from the seemingly important like the creatures' origins and the science behind it, to the trivial matters that aren't going to appear that detrimental initially, this one has a real problem and is actually enough to knock it considerably. It's still really good, but it's got a pretty big flaw to hold it down. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and a small scene of drug use.

    I remember seeing this movie in the theaters when I was 17 and enjoying it. I saw it was on Netflix instant and gave it a whirl... I'm not going to rip into this movie because it was full of clich&eacute;s, its a monster movie for goodness sake. As far as the "ancient idol/horrible monster/kill everyone around" genre goes, its not bad at all. I enjoy Tom Sizemore as an actor and while the script was what one would expect of 4 credited (and lord knows how many uncredited) screenwriters, I felt he did a good job as his character. Honestly for a movie of this type, the acting was just fine. They weren't required to do much, but that was OK. However, if you watch this movie, get used to entire scenes where you have no idea what is happening because its so dark. I understand, keep the settings dim to create fear (and realism, the power is out most of the time though why everyone in the museum works in near total darkness 99% of the time is a bit mind-boggling) but I can't be scared if I can't see what's happening when I'm supposed to! Dark, extremely dark shots keep the viewer in the (I can't do it), keep the viewer confused in many scenes. It was bad enough that a moderate length movie (109m) seemed MUCH longer and not in a good way. Much like gimmicky camera tricks or abuse of slow-motion (I'm looking at you John Woo) can ruin a movie, the overly dark nature of so many shots just leaves you sitting there wish you could tell what the hell was going on. I will say, possibly watching it on a larger screen, or a better quality television (mine is a 32" Sony LCD, nothing fancy) might mitigate lighting issues a bit, I don't know. Overall, its an OK movie for the genre that is partially ruined by not being able to tell what the hell is going on.

    I kept thinking my monitor settings were off, so I streamed it on 2 other systems (via Netflix), and still had the same results: DARK and IMPOSSIBLE to discern what the heck was going on most of the time. Oh, and in between the shadow-play, the lit scenes were just awful, making me long for the dark scenes again. What a turd of a movie. The CGI effects were sort of reminiscent of the effects in the original Predator, but every time the Klathagor (or whatever its called) beast would enter the scene, the scene lights flickered, flashed, dimmed, strobed or just went out entirely, leaving you guessing at what the gurgling screams and crunching sounds were about. Further, the camera angles were oblique at the critical moments and I kept looking at the wrong parts of the screen because the edits kept putting the beast at different locations and depths continuously. I hate chasing a movie around for 2 hours. Its an exhausting and irritating film. Did I mention that this was a turd of a movie?

    People don't hate this movie because it has bad effects, or bad acting. They hate it because it didn't stick too well to the book. But I don't know what they're complaining about It's an entertaining movie, and a lot of people hated it, and i just don't understand why. It's about a monster that runs rampid in a museum, and eats people's brains, that's it. If you wanted something more, like the meaning of life, you're not going to get it. But anyway, the film centers on a museum, which has just spent money it didn't really have on a new exhibit called superstitions. Needless to say, opening night is of the utmost importance, but the problem is, people are starting to be killed. By what, no one knows, but the murders are way to grizzly and gruesome to be human. So now it's up to Leiutnenant D'Agosta and a museum employee named Margo Green to find out what is causing the murders, and put an end to it before the opening night of the big exhibition. But despite their attempts, they find no murderer, and the exhibition opening still happens. At this point we've gathered that the killer requires nutrients from a plant that it cannot find. It just so happens that the Hyptothalamus region of the human brain also contains those nutrients. So The murderer, or monster,r because if you haven't figured out that it's a monster at this point, there's nothing to be said to you, takes to eating the museum employees brains to receive enough nutrients to survive. And with the big Exhibition opening with hundreds of people, it's pretty much a big smorgesborg for the creature. So when it attacks, a group of people get trapped in the building by a security system run awry. And now It's up to D'Agosta to get them out to safety. I'm not really going to explain anymore of the plot, because doing so would give away the twist ending, and it's also like trying to explain quantum physics in a few paragraphs that i'm far too lazy to type. But what I really want to talk about, is the comparison between the book and the movie. The Book I felt left something to be desired with the end, and a few scenes were just uneventful, like when the swat team goes into the museum. But the movie does a good job of giving the scenes more life. But it also wrote off a few good characters, and had an ending that was completely different to from the book(But i prefer the movie ending to the book ending). The monster is well made, and the movie is just good. My opinion could be different if i read the book before seeing the movie, but the only reason i wanted to read the book is because i saw the movie. Overall, a good movie that strayed pretty far from the path set by the book, but did a good job with giving some scenes better life then the book did. So I say, go check it out, see for yourself what you think.

    Even the most jaded horror movie addicts may find themselves squirming in parts of Peter Hyams' murky but well-made creature feature "The Relic" starring Penelope Ann Miller and Tom Sizemore. Meanwhile the faint of heart may want to reconsider enduring this experience. You'll lose count of the number of severed heads. You'll also lose count of the number of times that the filmmakers dare you to accompany heroes and victims down a catacomb of spooky hallways. Special effects wizard Stan Winston has created a huge, slimy, lizard critter with tusks for "The Relic" that would give "Alien," "Predator," and those "Jurassic Park" raptors a run for their money. "The Relic" is basically a haunted house chiller. Most of its grisly action occurs inside a creepy Chicago museum, within scores of shadowy corridors, labs, and staircases. A dinosaur reptile of amazing agility prowls these premises and feasts on flesh. Mainly, this hybrid monster tears your head off and munches a chunk of your brains. The melodramatic script pays homage to scary sagas such as "Jaws," "Alien," and "Jurassic Park." Penelope Ann Miller plays a dedicated but cute evolutionary biologist who pedals a bicycle to work and worries about who'll fund her research. She shares many of Ripley's heroic characteristics from the "Alien" franchise, except Penelope doesn't perform a strip tease for the monster. She keeps her clothes on and relies on her wits to outsmart the creature. Burly Tom Sizemore abets her as a superstitious Windy City cop. He wants to close the museum, but the mayor needs it open for a gala fund raiser. Naturally, the monster crashes the gala and heads roll. When the monster isn't terrifying the rich, the museum becomes an obstacle course. The monsters shuts down the power, and the wealthy patrons find themselves trapped in the dark, rained on by fire sprinklers. "The Relic" aspires to be more than just a horror movie. The worst thing about "The Relic" is its surplus of plot. What might have been a small horror movie turns into not only a big-scale scary movie, but also a disaster movie. The film opens with a jungle witchcraft scene that is supposed to frighten but winds up being incomprehensible. The filmmakers then build the plot and introduce their array of characters before the finally unleash the beast. Part of the time the scenarists clobber us with a load of scientific, computer gibberish that makes the movie sound realistic. Interestingly, everything that the monster devours becomes part of its DNA and guides it behavior. Peter Hyams lights the museum as if it were the space ship in "Alien." Hyams, who helmed "Outland" and "Running Scared," aims to scare the daylights out of you. He resorts to every tried-and-true truck to elicit paranoia and hype suspense. If you aren't family with how horror movies manipulate their audiences, you may find some scenes in "The Relic" a little intense. Predictability, of course, paralyzes the plot because Hyams spends too much time trying to be like other horror movies so that it breaks little new ground. But the effects may be gruesome enough that you forget the formula that the story follows. Hyams gets great help from composer John Debney whose tense, dramatic orchestral score heightens the tension. "The Relic" qualifies as a good horror movie boosted by glossy production values. This chiller is worth seeing at least once while you're searching for a genuine classic.

The CGI effects were sort of reminiscent of the effects in the original Predator, but every time the Klathagor (or whatever its called) beast would enter the scene, the scene lights flickered, flashed, dimmed, strobed or just went out entirely, leaving you guessing at what the gurgling screams and crunching sounds were about. Further, the camera angles were oblique at the critical moments and I kept looking at the wrong parts of the screen because the edits kept putting the beast at different locations and depths continuously. I hate chasing a movie around for 2 hours. Its an exhausting and irritating film. Did I mention that this was a turd of a movie?

    People don't hate this movie because it has bad effects, or bad acting. They hate it because it didn't stick too well to the book. But I don't know what they're complaining about It's an entertaining movie, and a lot of people hated it, and i just don't understand why. It's about a monster that runs rampid in a museum, and eats people's brains, that's it. If you wanted something more, like the meaning of life, you're not going to get it. But anyway, the film centers on a museum, which has just spent money it didn't really have on a new exhibit called superstitions. Needless to say, opening night is of the utmost importance, but the problem is, people are starting to be killed. By what, no one knows, but the murders are way to grizzly and gruesome to be human. So now it's up to Leiutnenant D'Agosta and a museum employee named Margo Green to find out what is causing the murders, and put an end to it before the opening night of the big exhibition. But despite their attempts, they find no murderer, and the exhibition opening still happens. At this point we've gathered that the killer requires nutrients from a plant that it cannot find. It just so happens that the Hyptothalamus region of the human brain also contains those nutrients. So The murderer, or monster,r because if you haven't figured out that it's a monster at this point, there's nothing to be said to you, takes to eating the museum employees brains to receive enough nutrients to survive. And with the big Exhibition opening with hundreds of people, it's pretty much a big smorgesborg for the creature. So when it attacks, a group of people get trapped in the building by a security system run awry. And now It's up to D'Agosta to get them out to safety. I'm not really going to explain anymore of the plot, because doing so would give away the twist ending, and it's also like trying to explain quantum physics in a few paragraphs that i'm far too lazy to type. But what I really want to talk about, is the comparison between the book and the movie. The Book I felt left something to be desired with the end, and a few scenes were just uneventful, like when the swat team goes into the museum. But the movie does a good job of giving the scenes more life. But it also wrote off a few good characters, and had an ending that was completely different to from the book(But i prefer the movie ending to the book ending). The monster is well made, and the movie is just good. My opinion could be different if i read the book before seeing the movie, but the only reason i wanted to read the book is because i saw the movie. Overall, a good movie that strayed pretty far from the path set by the book, but did a good job with giving some scenes better life then the book did. So I say, go check it out, see for yourself what you think.

    Even the most jaded horror movie addicts may find themselves squirming in parts of Peter Hyams' murky but well-made creature feature "The Relic" starring Penelope Ann Miller and Tom Sizemore. Meanwhile the faint of heart may want to reconsider enduring this experience. You'll lose count of the number of severed heads. You'll also lose count of the number of times that the filmmakers dare you to accompany heroes and victims down a catacomb of spooky hallways. Special effects wizard Stan Winston has created a huge, slimy, lizard critter with tusks for "The Relic" that would give "Alien," "Predator," and those "Jurassic Park" raptors a run for their money. "The Relic" is basically a haunted house chiller. Most of its grisly action occurs inside a creepy Chicago museum, within scores of shadowy corridors, labs, and staircases. A dinosaur reptile of amazing agility prowls these premises and feasts on flesh. Mainly, this hybrid monster tears your head off and munches a chunk of your brains. The melodramatic script pays homage to scary sagas such as "Jaws," "Alien," and "Jurassic Park." Penelope Ann Miller plays a dedicated but cute evolutionary biologist who pedals a bicycle to work and worries about who'll fund her research. She shares many of Ripley's heroic characteristics from the "Alien" franchise, except Penelope doesn't perform a strip tease for the monster. She keeps her clothes on and relies on her wits to outsmart the creature. Burly Tom Sizemore abets her as a superstitious Windy City cop. He wants to close the museum, but the mayor needs it open for a gala fund raiser. Naturally, the monster crashes the gala and heads roll. When the monster isn't terrifying the rich, the museum becomes an obstacle course. The monsters shuts down the power, and the wealthy patrons find themselves trapped in the dark, rained on by fire sprinklers. "The Relic" aspires to be more than just a horror movie. The worst thing about "The Relic" is its surplus of plot. What might have been a small horror movie turns into not only a big-scale scary movie, but also a disaster movie. The film opens with a jungle witchcraft scene that is supposed to frighten but winds up being incomprehensible. The filmmakers then build the plot and introduce their array of characters before the finally unleash the beast. Part of the time the scenarists clobber us with a load of scientific, computer gibberish that makes the movie sound realistic. Interestingly, everything that the monster devours becomes part of its DNA and guides it behavior. Peter Hyams lights the museum as if it were the space ship in "Alien." Hyams, who helmed "Outland" and "Running Scared," aims to scare the daylights out of you. He resorts to every tried-and-true truck to elicit paranoia and hype suspense. If you aren't family with how horror movies manipulate their audiences, you may find some scenes in "The Relic" a little intense. Predictability, of course, paralyzes the plot because Hyams spends too much time trying to be like other horror movies so that it breaks little new ground. But the effects may be gruesome enough that you forget the formula that the story follows. Hyams gets great help from composer John Debney whose tense, dramatic orchestral score heightens the tension. "The Relic" qualifies as a good horror movie boosted by glossy production values. This chiller is worth seeing at least once while you're searching for a genuine classic.

    After cargo from South America find its way to the Chicago Museum Of Natural History Sans owner, a series of brutal murders happen drawing the suspicions of Lt. Vincent (Tom Sizemore) who teams up with Margo (Penelope Ann Miller),a researcher at said museum who has some unanswered questions of her own, to find out what they're dealing with. First of all, let me get this out of the way. This movie is atrociously lit, so much so that if you're not watching it in a completely darkened room you'll be straining to see what's going on in some key scenes (and even then...). Despite this one, admittedly major gripe, the film was serviceable enough and a fun b-movie creature-feature IF you haven't read the far superior book before hand. If you have, your results may vary greatly. My Grade: D+ (the lighting subtracted a letter grade for me)

    "The Relic" is a film that will make you jump and squirm in your seat, it's THAT good. What results (in the novel and film) is a grotesque reptilian-mammalian creature that decapitates its victims and devours the one part of the victim's body that can supply the creature with the missing hormonal concoction: the human hypothalamus. Taking place mainly in the fictional "Natural History Museum of Chicago", the film offers viewers what goes on behind museum walls, like that museums only show about 2% of their collections that can sometimes reach numbers in the millions, or that the common domestic beetle cleans carcasses of their flesh in preparation for taxidermy. Aside from the educational aspects, the film also offers some of the most complicated human-creature interaction scenes ever filmed, as well as breath-taking visual and creature effects, most of them more complicated than the "Jurassic Park" series's scenes. The film also shows some of the most visually disturbing images (many which were cut from the final picture), like 2 on screen decapitations, and bodies being severed in two (please keep in mind though, all these scenes are done in taste, as opposed to the more famous "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Friday the 13th" series.) And even if you don't include the gore, just the lighting and ambiance of the film is eerie in itself. Other films, when attempting to show a "dark" scene, light up the picture with blue lights, allowing the audience to see the advisory right behind the main characters. In "The Relic" though, most of the scenes are lit only by a flashlight, allowing the audience to see only what the characters see. "The Relic", even though it did not get many good reviews, is an excellent film that gives you many thrills in under two hours. By the time the film is over, and if you're really into it, I guarantee that your pulse will be up by about 20 more beats per minute.

    A researcher at Chicago's Natural History Museum returns from South America with crates containing his findings. When they arrive at the museum without the owner there appears to be very little inside. Police discover gruesome remains on the cargo ship that brought the crates, and then another murder in the museum itself. Investigating the murder is Lt. D'Agosta who enlists the help of Dr. Green at the museum. Unknown to both though, there is a large creature roaming the museum, which is preparing itself for a benefit reception...... The relic hasn't aged very well since the last time I saw this back in 1998, and the script doesn't hold up either. The film is basically Night At The Museum for adults, and about as entertaining. It's by the numbers stuff, museum gets dark, people get picked off every now and again, the monster isn't seen until the very end, and only two teachers from Kindergarten Cop and Tom Sizemore can save the day. If this were made today, it'd be released straight to Blu Ray and vanish without a trace. The years have been really unkind to this film. Not as good as I remember.

    A homicide detective (Tom Sizemore) and an anthropologist (Penelope Ann Miller) try to destroy a South American lizard-like god, who is on a people eating rampage in a Chicago museum. I love this film because it is humorous and there is some bizarre obsession with various kinds of coffee (mocha, espresso and latte all get mentioned at different times). And that is before it turns into a monster movie. Ebert said it "combines the conventions of the horror and disaster genres" and "is actually a lot of fun, if you like special effects and gore." Siskel called it "surprisingly entertaining", and even Leonard Maltin had to say the monster "is especially impressive." Yet, the film allegedly cost 60 million and only made 33 million at the box office, making it a flop. Perhaps if the lead had been Harrison Ford rather than Tom Sizemore, this would have drawn in the extra people (and possibly have given the film a stronger actor, with all due respect to Sizemore). I tend to side with the critics on this one -- I thought it was a lot of fun if nothing else.

    One of my guilty pleasures is the collaborative efforts of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. I chanced up a copy of "Cabinet of Curiosities," a book in the middle of their combined canon. I wondered what else they had written, and so in the middle of my more serious reading, I went back and read all their books, including the one this film is based on. It is a bit of a ripoff of the 1931 Karloff "The Mummy." Things are brought back by museum curators for a huge exhibit at the Museum of Natural History. Of course, it unleashes a horror that brings death and destruction. There is a lot of the "jump out of the shadows" stuff, but the special effects aren't bad and it is pretty engaging. The two principle characters who appear in most of the books begin a bit of a relationship here. It has the pat technique of the arrogant, self-centered, selfish people victimized first. The museum provides a neat backdrop (it has all kinds of secret places, underground heating systems, doors that haven't been opened for a long time). It's a great place for a murderous beast to ply its trade. There are several literary sequels; however, this wasn't a big money-maker and I wonder if anyone will put up the money or commitment to try again.

    After a rash of deaths in the museum, a detective and a doctor learn a smuggled, mutated lizard from South America is the culprit and must stop it before the museum's charity event draws the creature closer. Overall a rather decent entry, there's enough here to make this worthwhile. One of the best is the rather plentiful gore on display, both in quality and quantity. Beyond numerous limbs being ripped off, a series of nasty scratches and the decapitations, the fact that the scenes look really good due to the high-quality effects used, both in the prosthetics and the creature itself, this one has an overall well-rounded base to provide it's great qualities on. While in overall size and appearance the beast is a little problematic, the fact that it's still created in a great manner is a nice point about it, and the effects do look good. This one also tends to feature a bit more suspense in its attacks than expected, with several attacks being real stand-out affairs. While it does have a bit of a logic problem in most regards, from the seemingly important like the creatures' origins and the science behind it, to the trivial matters that aren't going to appear that detrimental initially, this one has a real problem and is actually enough to knock it considerably. It's still really good, but it's got a pretty big flaw to hold it down. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and a small scene of drug use.

    I remember seeing this movie in the theaters when I was 17 and enjoying it. I saw it was on Netflix instant and gave it a whirl... I'm not going to rip into this movie because it was full of clich&eacute;s, its a monster movie for goodness sake. As far as the "ancient idol/horrible monster/kill everyone around" genre goes, its not bad at all. I enjoy Tom Sizemore as an actor and while the script was what one would expect of 4 credited (and lord knows how many uncredited) screenwriters, I felt he did a good job as his character. Honestly for a movie of this type, the acting was just fine. They weren't required to do much, but that was OK. However, if you watch this movie, get used to entire scenes where you have no idea what is happening because its so dark. I understand, keep the settings dim to create fear (and realism, the power is out most of the time though why everyone in the museum works in near total darkness 99% of the time is a bit mind-boggling) but I can't be scared if I can't see what's happening when I'm supposed to! Dark, extremely dark shots keep the viewer in the (I can't do it), keep the viewer confused in many scenes. It was bad enough that a moderate length movie (109m) seemed MUCH longer and not in a good way. Much like gimmicky camera tricks or abuse of slow-motion (I'm looking at you John Woo) can ruin a movie, the overly dark nature of so many shots just leaves you sitting there wish you could tell what the hell was going on. I will say, possibly watching it on a larger screen, or a better quality television (mine is a 32" Sony LCD, nothing fancy) might mitigate lighting issues a bit, I don't know. Overall, its an OK movie for the genre that is partially ruined by not being able to tell what the hell is going on.

I love this film because it is humorous and there is some bizarre obsession with various kinds of coffee (mocha, espresso and latte all get mentioned at different times). And that is before it turns into a monster movie. Ebert said it "combines the conventions of the horror and disaster genres" and "is actually a lot of fun, if you like special effects and gore." Siskel called it "surprisingly entertaining", and even Leonard Maltin had to say the monster "is especially impressive." Yet, the film allegedly cost 60 million and only made 33 million at the box office, making it a flop. Perhaps if the lead had been Harrison Ford rather than Tom Sizemore, this would have drawn in the extra people (and possibly have given the film a stronger actor, with all due respect to Sizemore). I tend to side with the critics on this one -- I thought it was a lot of fun if nothing else.

    One of my guilty pleasures is the collaborative efforts of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. I chanced up a copy of "Cabinet of Curiosities," a book in the middle of their combined canon. I wondered what else they had written, and so in the middle of my more serious reading, I went back and read all their books, including the one this film is based on. It is a bit of a ripoff of the 1931 Karloff "The Mummy." Things are brought back by museum curators for a huge exhibit at the Museum of Natural History. Of course, it unleashes a horror that brings death and destruction. There is a lot of the "jump out of the shadows" stuff, but the special effects aren't bad and it is pretty engaging. The two principle characters who appear in most of the books begin a bit of a relationship here. It has the pat technique of the arrogant, self-centered, selfish people victimized first. The museum provides a neat backdrop (it has all kinds of secret places, underground heating systems, doors that haven't been opened for a long time). It's a great place for a murderous beast to ply its trade. There are several literary sequels; however, this wasn't a big money-maker and I wonder if anyone will put up the money or commitment to try again.

    After a rash of deaths in the museum, a detective and a doctor learn a smuggled, mutated lizard from South America is the culprit and must stop it before the museum's charity event draws the creature closer. Overall a rather decent entry, there's enough here to make this worthwhile. One of the best is the rather plentiful gore on display, both in quality and quantity. Beyond numerous limbs being ripped off, a series of nasty scratches and the decapitations, the fact that the scenes look really good due to the high-quality effects used, both in the prosthetics and the creature itself, this one has an overall well-rounded base to provide it's great qualities on. While in overall size and appearance the beast is a little problematic, the fact that it's still created in a great manner is a nice point about it, and the effects do look good. This one also tends to feature a bit more suspense in its attacks than expected, with several attacks being real stand-out affairs. While it does have a bit of a logic problem in most regards, from the seemingly important like the creatures' origins and the science behind it, to the trivial matters that aren't going to appear that detrimental initially, this one has a real problem and is actually enough to knock it considerably. It's still really good, but it's got a pretty big flaw to hold it down. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and a small scene of drug use.

    I remember seeing this movie in the theaters when I was 17 and enjoying it. I saw it was on Netflix instant and gave it a whirl... I'm not going to rip into this movie because it was full of clich&eacute;s, its a monster movie for goodness sake. As far as the "ancient idol/horrible monster/kill everyone around" genre goes, its not bad at all. I enjoy Tom Sizemore as an actor and while the script was what one would expect of 4 credited (and lord knows how many uncredited) screenwriters, I felt he did a good job as his character. Honestly for a movie of this type, the acting was just fine. They weren't required to do much, but that was OK. However, if you watch this movie, get used to entire scenes where you have no idea what is happening because its so dark. I understand, keep the settings dim to create fear (and realism, the power is out most of the time though why everyone in the museum works in near total darkness 99% of the time is a bit mind-boggling) but I can't be scared if I can't see what's happening when I'm supposed to! Dark, extremely dark shots keep the viewer in the (I can't do it), keep the viewer confused in many scenes. It was bad enough that a moderate length movie (109m) seemed MUCH longer and not in a good way. Much like gimmicky camera tricks or abuse of slow-motion (I'm looking at you John Woo) can ruin a movie, the overly dark nature of so many shots just leaves you sitting there wish you could tell what the hell was going on. I will say, possibly watching it on a larger screen, or a better quality television (mine is a 32" Sony LCD, nothing fancy) might mitigate lighting issues a bit, I don't know. Overall, its an OK movie for the genre that is partially ruined by not being able to tell what the hell is going on.

    I kept thinking my monitor settings were off, so I streamed it on 2 other systems (via Netflix), and still had the same results: DARK and IMPOSSIBLE to discern what the heck was going on most of the time. Oh, and in between the shadow-play, the lit scenes were just awful, making me long for the dark scenes again. What a turd of a movie. The CGI effects were sort of reminiscent of the effects in the original Predator, but every time the Klathagor (or whatever its called) beast would enter the scene, the scene lights flickered, flashed, dimmed, strobed or just went out entirely, leaving you guessing at what the gurgling screams and crunching sounds were about. Further, the camera angles were oblique at the critical moments and I kept looking at the wrong parts of the screen because the edits kept putting the beast at different locations and depths continuously. I hate chasing a movie around for 2 hours. Its an exhausting and irritating film. Did I mention that this was a turd of a movie?

    People don't hate this movie because it has bad effects, or bad acting. They hate it because it didn't stick too well to the book. But I don't know what they're complaining about It's an entertaining movie, and a lot of people hated it, and i just don't understand why. It's about a monster that runs rampid in a museum, and eats people's brains, that's it. If you wanted something more, like the meaning of life, you're not going to get it. But anyway, the film centers on a museum, which has just spent money it didn't really have on a new exhibit called superstitions. Needless to say, opening night is of the utmost importance, but the problem is, people are starting to be killed. By what, no one knows, but the murders are way to grizzly and gruesome to be human. So now it's up to Leiutnenant D'Agosta and a museum employee named Margo Green to find out what is causing the murders, and put an end to it before the opening night of the big exhibition. But despite their attempts, they find no murderer, and the exhibition opening still happens. At this point we've gathered that the killer requires nutrients from a plant that it cannot find. It just so happens that the Hyptothalamus region of the human brain also contains those nutrients. So The murderer, or monster,r because if you haven't figured out that it's a monster at this point, there's nothing to be said to you, takes to eating the museum employees brains to receive enough nutrients to survive. And with the big Exhibition opening with hundreds of people, it's pretty much a big smorgesborg for the creature. So when it attacks, a group of people get trapped in the building by a security system run awry. And now It's up to D'Agosta to get them out to safety. I'm not really going to explain anymore of the plot, because doing so would give away the twist ending, and it's also like trying to explain quantum physics in a few paragraphs that i'm far too lazy to type. But what I really want to talk about, is the comparison between the book and the movie. The Book I felt left something to be desired with the end, and a few scenes were just uneventful, like when the swat team goes into the museum. But the movie does a good job of giving the scenes more life. But it also wrote off a few good characters, and had an ending that was completely different to from the book(But i prefer the movie ending to the book ending). The monster is well made, and the movie is just good. My opinion could be different if i read the book before seeing the movie, but the only reason i wanted to read the book is because i saw the movie. Overall, a good movie that strayed pretty far from the path set by the book, but did a good job with giving some scenes better life then the book did. So I say, go check it out, see for yourself what you think.

    Even the most jaded horror movie addicts may find themselves squirming in parts of Peter Hyams' murky but well-made creature feature "The Relic" starring Penelope Ann Miller and Tom Sizemore. Meanwhile the faint of heart may want to reconsider enduring this experience. You'll lose count of the number of severed heads. You'll also lose count of the number of times that the filmmakers dare you to accompany heroes and victims down a catacomb of spooky hallways. Special effects wizard Stan Winston has created a huge, slimy, lizard critter with tusks for "The Relic" that would give "Alien," "Predator," and those "Jurassic Park" raptors a run for their money. "The Relic" is basically a haunted house chiller. Most of its grisly action occurs inside a creepy Chicago museum, within scores of shadowy corridors, labs, and staircases. A dinosaur reptile of amazing agility prowls these premises and feasts on flesh. Mainly, this hybrid monster tears your head off and munches a chunk of your brains. The melodramatic script pays homage to scary sagas such as "Jaws," "Alien," and "Jurassic Park." Penelope Ann Miller plays a dedicated but cute evolutionary biologist who pedals a bicycle to work and worries about who'll fund her research. She shares many of Ripley's heroic characteristics from the "Alien" franchise, except Penelope doesn't perform a strip tease for the monster. She keeps her clothes on and relies on her wits to outsmart the creature. Burly Tom Sizemore abets her as a superstitious Windy City cop. He wants to close the museum, but the mayor needs it open for a gala fund raiser. Naturally, the monster crashes the gala and heads roll. When the monster isn't terrifying the rich, the museum becomes an obstacle course. The monsters shuts down the power, and the wealthy patrons find themselves trapped in the dark, rained on by fire sprinklers. "The Relic" aspires to be more than just a horror movie. The worst thing about "The Relic" is its surplus of plot. What might have been a small horror movie turns into not only a big-scale scary movie, but also a disaster movie. The film opens with a jungle witchcraft scene that is supposed to frighten but winds up being incomprehensible. The filmmakers then build the plot and introduce their array of characters before the finally unleash the beast. Part of the time the scenarists clobber us with a load of scientific, computer gibberish that makes the movie sound realistic. Interestingly, everything that the monster devours becomes part of its DNA and guides it behavior. Peter Hyams lights the museum as if it were the space ship in "Alien." Hyams, who helmed "Outland" and "Running Scared," aims to scare the daylights out of you. He resorts to every tried-and-true truck to elicit paranoia and hype suspense. If you aren't family with how horror movies manipulate their audiences, you may find some scenes in "The Relic" a little intense. Predictability, of course, paralyzes the plot because Hyams spends too much time trying to be like other horror movies so that it breaks little new ground. But the effects may be gruesome enough that you forget the formula that the story follows. Hyams gets great help from composer John Debney whose tense, dramatic orchestral score heightens the tension. "The Relic" qualifies as a good horror movie boosted by glossy production values. This chiller is worth seeing at least once while you're searching for a genuine classic.

    After cargo from South America find its way to the Chicago Museum Of Natural History Sans owner, a series of brutal murders happen drawing the suspicions of Lt. Vincent (Tom Sizemore) who teams up with Margo (Penelope Ann Miller),a researcher at said museum who has some unanswered questions of her own, to find out what they're dealing with. First of all, let me get this out of the way. This movie is atrociously lit, so much so that if you're not watching it in a completely darkened room you'll be straining to see what's going on in some key scenes (and even then...). Despite this one, admittedly major gripe, the film was serviceable enough and a fun b-movie creature-feature IF you haven't read the far superior book before hand. If you have, your results may vary greatly. My Grade: D+ (the lighting subtracted a letter grade for me)

    "The Relic" is a film that will make you jump and squirm in your seat, it's THAT good. What results (in the novel and film) is a grotesque reptilian-mammalian creature that decapitates its victims and devours the one part of the victim's body that can supply the creature with the missing hormonal concoction: the human hypothalamus. Taking place mainly in the fictional "Natural History Museum of Chicago", the film offers viewers what goes on behind museum walls, like that museums only show about 2% of their collections that can sometimes reach numbers in the millions, or that the common domestic beetle cleans carcasses of their flesh in preparation for taxidermy. Aside from the educational aspects, the film also offers some of the most complicated human-creature interaction scenes ever filmed, as well as breath-taking visual and creature effects, most of them more complicated than the "Jurassic Park" series's scenes. The film also shows some of the most visually disturbing images (many which were cut from the final picture), like 2 on screen decapitations, and bodies being severed in two (please keep in mind though, all these scenes are done in taste, as opposed to the more famous "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Friday the 13th" series.) And even if you don't include the gore, just the lighting and ambiance of the film is eerie in itself. Other films, when attempting to show a "dark" scene, light up the picture with blue lights, allowing the audience to see the advisory right behind the main characters. In "The Relic" though, most of the scenes are lit only by a flashlight, allowing the audience to see only what the characters see. "The Relic", even though it did not get many good reviews, is an excellent film that gives you many thrills in under two hours. By the time the film is over, and if you're really into it, I guarantee that your pulse will be up by about 20 more beats per minute.

    A researcher at Chicago's Natural History Museum returns from South America with crates containing his findings. When they arrive at the museum without the owner there appears to be very little inside. Police discover gruesome remains on the cargo ship that brought the crates, and then another murder in the museum itself. Investigating the murder is Lt. D'Agosta who enlists the help of Dr. Green at the museum. Unknown to both though, there is a large creature roaming the museum, which is preparing itself for a benefit reception...... The relic hasn't aged very well since the last time I saw this back in 1998, and the script doesn't hold up either. The film is basically Night At The Museum for adults, and about as entertaining. It's by the numbers stuff, museum gets dark, people get picked off every now and again, the monster isn't seen until the very end, and only two teachers from Kindergarten Cop and Tom Sizemore can save the day. If this were made today, it'd be released straight to Blu Ray and vanish without a trace. The years have been really unkind to this film. Not as good as I remember.

The monsters shuts down the power, and the wealthy patrons find themselves trapped in the dark, rained on by fire sprinklers. "The Relic" aspires to be more than just a horror movie. The worst thing about "The Relic" is its surplus of plot. What might have been a small horror movie turns into not only a big-scale scary movie, but also a disaster movie. The film opens with a jungle witchcraft scene that is supposed to frighten but winds up being incomprehensible. The filmmakers then build the plot and introduce their array of characters before the finally unleash the beast. Part of the time the scenarists clobber us with a load of scientific, computer gibberish that makes the movie sound realistic. Interestingly, everything that the monster devours becomes part of its DNA and guides it behavior. Peter Hyams lights the museum as if it were the space ship in "Alien." Hyams, who helmed "Outland" and "Running Scared," aims to scare the daylights out of you. He resorts to every tried-and-true truck to elicit paranoia and hype suspense. If you aren't family with how horror movies manipulate their audiences, you may find some scenes in "The Relic" a little intense. Predictability, of course, paralyzes the plot because Hyams spends too much time trying to be like other horror movies so that it breaks little new ground. But the effects may be gruesome enough that you forget the formula that the story follows. Hyams gets great help from composer John Debney whose tense, dramatic orchestral score heightens the tension. "The Relic" qualifies as a good horror movie boosted by glossy production values. This chiller is worth seeing at least once while you're searching for a genuine classic.

    After cargo from South America find its way to the Chicago Museum Of Natural History Sans owner, a series of brutal murders happen drawing the suspicions of Lt. Vincent (Tom Sizemore) who teams up with Margo (Penelope Ann Miller),a researcher at said museum who has some unanswered questions of her own, to find out what they're dealing with. First of all, let me get this out of the way. This movie is atrociously lit, so much so that if you're not watching it in a completely darkened room you'll be straining to see what's going on in some key scenes (and even then...). Despite this one, admittedly major gripe, the film was serviceable enough and a fun b-movie creature-feature IF you haven't read the far superior book before hand. If you have, your results may vary greatly. My Grade: D+ (the lighting subtracted a letter grade for me)

    "The Relic" is a film that will make you jump and squirm in your seat, it's THAT good. What results (in the novel and film) is a grotesque reptilian-mammalian creature that decapitates its victims and devours the one part of the victim's body that can supply the creature with the missing hormonal concoction: the human hypothalamus. Taking place mainly in the fictional "Natural History Museum of Chicago", the film offers viewers what goes on behind museum walls, like that museums only show about 2% of their collections that can sometimes reach numbers in the millions, or that the common domestic beetle cleans carcasses of their flesh in preparation for taxidermy. Aside from the educational aspects, the film also offers some of the most complicated human-creature interaction scenes ever filmed, as well as breath-taking visual and creature effects, most of them more complicated than the "Jurassic Park" series's scenes. The film also shows some of the most visually disturbing images (many which were cut from the final picture), like 2 on screen decapitations, and bodies being severed in two (please keep in mind though, all these scenes are done in taste, as opposed to the more famous "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Friday the 13th" series.) And even if you don't include the gore, just the lighting and ambiance of the film is eerie in itself. Other films, when attempting to show a "dark" scene, light up the picture with blue lights, allowing the audience to see the advisory right behind the main characters. In "The Relic" though, most of the scenes are lit only by a flashlight, allowing the audience to see only what the characters see. "The Relic", even though it did not get many good reviews, is an excellent film that gives you many thrills in under two hours. By the time the film is over, and if you're really into it, I guarantee that your pulse will be up by about 20 more beats per minute.
