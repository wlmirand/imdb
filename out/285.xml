    Brenda Blethyn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Timothy Spall, Phyllis Logan, and Claire Rushbrook star in "Secrets & Lies," a 1996 film written and directed by Mike Leigh. The script is actually improvised, with the actors learning what the characters learn as they go along. Brenda Blethyn is Cynthia Rose Purley, a factory worker and single mother with an obnoxious daughter, Roxanne (Rushbrook). Cynthia is dependent for the occasional handout by her successful photographer brother, Maurice (Spall). Maurice lives in a lovely home with his wife (Logan); Cynthia can't stand her and the feeling is mutual. Maurice no longer has the relationship that he once had with his niece Roxanne, and this bothers him. Cynthia gets a call one day from a woman named Hortense Cumberbatch (Jean-Baptiste) who claims to be the daughter she gave up for adoption. After some hemming and hawing, Cynthia agrees to meet her at a subway stop. When she meets Hortense, she's shocked. Hortense is black. This is a wonderful, poignant, and funny story with just the right amount of drama and humor. The scene in the restaurant, when Cynthia says that Hortense couldn't possibly be her daughter because she's never been with a black man is absolutely priceless. The performances are tremendous. Brenda Blethyn is marvelous as the fragile, needy, eager to please Cynthia, though the character gets a bit annoying with her high-pitched voice and constant talking. Timothy Spall plays a big man with a big heart and will bring one to tears toward the end of the film. It was great to see Phyllis Logan from Lovejoy in such a marvelous role, and she does a great job. Marianne Jean-Baptiste is wonderful as a successful young woman who fights to keep her equilibrium when she's in the midst of a family explosion. Really enjoyed this -- and I guess the name Cumberbatch isn't as unusual as I thought.

    it'f life and direct.- and every thing that comes after this sentence is to convince the computer to accept my review. The problem is that I don't have to say much more about the film. It speaks for itself; life and direct... beautiful acting raw in the making. pretty brilliant. there it is... and the rest is about filling the requirement of a stupid machine that does not understand the spice in the shortness of a review. But then again, this is worth some time and to fill a couple of lines is no bother to me. And so I do it. Well I try at least. The line just came to me, and I think it fits. Watching a on popcorn film and don't worrying about time is a compliment in itself. What else, what else...

    At first it seems like a fairly routine family drama, but as these characters work their way under your skin, they develop rich complexities and rewarding relationships. The results are intensely moving, and I'm not ashamed to admit that by the end I was a blubbering wreck. Not a note of it seems phony, contrived or forced. There is no "Jeremy" character as in NAKED, every "villain" is imbued with true humanity. It seems almost criminal to single out any particular performance, as the cast is brilliant across the board. But I must say I was especially taken with the heartbreaking Brenda Blethyn and the utterly endearing Marianne Jean-Baptiste, two actresses who I've only seen in bit parts in far lesser works. If I were nitpicking, I'd say the Ron Cook (the photographer that Timothy Spall bought his studio from) scene is unnecessary and a bit out of place. It's not a bad scene at all, just a bit distracting. But other than that minor quibble, I adored it. A warm, touching, magnificent look at family, the barriers that keep them apart, and the roles and disguises we maintain for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is about lies that family members keep to each other. We start with three lines. We have a low-class woman, named Cynthia. She has a daughter (Roxanne) whom she seems to have a problematic relation. There are discussions, mostly about her dating a boy. Then we have Hortense, which is a grown up woman and a very brave one, who gets interest in knowing who her real mother is (since her adoptive mother died recently). In her research in the registry she finds out that her mother is Cynthia. Then , Hortense meets Cynthia, and they start to get along. During the story of Cynthia and Hortense, there's Maurice and Monica who are a married couple. Maurice is Cynthia's brother who does photography for a living. He and Monica have problems too. There's a lot of tension in the air. It is maybe a sign that something needs to be told. The tension culminates in Roxanne's birthday party, where Hortense is invited too. Roxanne is told that Hortense is her sister. Cynthia argues with Monica reminding her of older problems with money. Cynthia implies with Monica because of her not giving a child to his brother. Maurice explodes and tells everyone that Monica is infertile. This film is all about how people try to hide their ghosts, maybe thinking that they won't be a mess. We live in a society that makes us close to ourselves, and hide our emotions and past events. We try everyday to forget about them. But they are there, alive and they tend to come back. I found this movie very emotional and moral at the same time. The actors were incredible,and there seemed to be a little of theatrical scenes, like the scene where Cynthia and Hortense take a tea. I loved the acting in this movie. Congratulations Mike Leigh.

    Review: i saw Another Year last year and was really impressed by Mike Leigh's enormous talent but most of all his unique and amazing style of filmmaking. i have seen Vera Drake a bit and will catch it soon but after watching this movie, i was stunned and surprised utterly by how flawless and mind blowing this movie was. Secrets & Lies is the reason why i am a big fan of Mike Leigh. he is a powerful film maker who gets the most out of his actors, something which lacks very much in everyone today. he is a very intelligent and classy director of this time that might reminds you of the geniuses of past. i think it is just great for anyone to tackle subjects that are so real among human beings and to have a such deeper approach towards society is just amazing though most film makers seems to avoid this kind of view in their movies. Woody Allen overall made some very good movie with great smart comedic undertones that you can't help but highly praise, his mind is filled with things and talk and talks that makes most of his movies masterpieces. on the other hand, Mike Leigh seems to be on a track where he makes these quite smart and genius dramatic movies with natural and quite real characters with one or other problems still having comic feel to it. he have made some characters that you can't help but laugh at them even though later on they are the one that makes you cry. they are somewhat similar but Woody Allen being more into Comedy than Leigh being into dramatics but not bring quite over dramatic and leaving us with a feel of comic characters or moments. i saw it many weeks ago and i don't know whether i would be able to talk about it the way i should as i have been quite lazy in the past few weeks as these reviews are piling up on me. okay so the most favorite and perhaps mind blowing thing about this movie is performances. Leigh seems to get everything out of his actors and he knows it so well. he gives them freedom to improvise to get even more of them and their own feelings into the characters. one thing i read was that Brenda herself didn't knew that the character of Hortense is suppose to be Black, she wasn't told that by anyone thus making her reaction at that train station so unbelievably real. Brenda Blethyn according to me is one of the best actress ever or she got one of the best characters ever as Cynthia because what i saw in this movie totally blew my mind and every bit of me away. she is just mind blowing and powerful in this movie. i can't believe that she didn't got Oscar for this. there were so many scenes where what you see is the performance of her life. what she does is cry and cry in so many scenes and the way she talks is out if this world. she was someone i reacted to while watching the movie. i can't believe how much of a fan i am of her now that i saw her perform so amazing. i am going to put her in my list of Best performances soon. it was not just her but everyone else performed really good too. Marianne Jean-Baptiste was superb as a supporting actress in a role of a woman searching and finding herself, her identity, her life. she performed amazingly too and was very believable and absorbed in the characters. even being a black woman the scenes of her and Brenda were so amazing you could see the mother daughter interaction in a very real way. Timothy Spall as Cynthia's brother gave the best performance of his career, in the final scene at the family gathering where all the secrets and lies are revealed, the perfect shot that he gives as he speaks very loud and frustrated by all what is going on in contrast to what he have been doing for this family is epic. great and memorable performance by everyone. Screenplay of this movie is just spectacular in every aspect where you don't see a movie but astonishingly a real life footage or a documentary because all that goes on in the movie is something that happens. written greatly by Leigh i loved every bit of this movie. this movie is simple in the structure but leaves you thinking forever. the interaction of the characters are just epic in a way you don't see anything like this in movies nowadays where everything seems so synthetic. some breathtaking and heart stopping moments in the movie like that emotional scene in the bar where Cynthia and Hortense meets for the first time is one of the best moments i have seen in a movie. it is a 8 minutes single uninterrupted shot. the reaction of Cynthia and all the emotions are so authentic and real it leaves you wondering. what Brenda Blethyn does in that single shot crying, explaining, shocked, wondering, laughing, recalling her past, thinking about her family and all the tensions going on and what would happen is easily seen in her pure performance. and the final scenes where everything is revealed in the swirls of emotions, shouts and cries is mind blowing. This movie is completely flawless and wonderful drama that i think is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life. you will see real people in the actors and everything else that happens will leave you speechless. this is a movie that you must see.

    Arguably this is Mike Leigh's most popular film as it obtained 5 Oscar nominations (BEST ACTRESS, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST PICTURE, BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS and BEST ORIGINAL SCRIPT) and the Golden Palm in Cannes that year. I love Leigh's work very much and I previously watched VERA DRAKE (2004) and NAKED (1993), both brave and extraordinary. Still waiting to watch his recent pictures ANOTHER YEAR (2010) and HAPPY-GO-LUCKY (2008). The film itself burrows deep into the process of a successful black orphan looking for her birth mother (who is surprisingly set to be a low-class single white woman), arresting its audience with its slow pace of unraveling the back-story of their skin difference and their family. The warm-hearted tone is rare to behold in a Mike Leigh's film, and the happy ending ambiguously serves to leave its viewers a feel-good impression after the credits' rolling up. I must admit that it is a smart move, and expands itself to a wider demography. Surely Leigh's poignant portrayal of ordinary citizens is his trump card and renders a platform to allow the excellent cast to showcase their kaleidoscopic capabilities and leave its audience mesmerized. the Oscar-nominated mother-and-daughter pair (Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is deservingly splendid, especially Brenda, I rank her as my win that year, the strength and suffer of her character is so tangible when she is on screen; also Timothy Spall fully exposes his talent for his chubby but charming role as the younger brother of the mother. It is a wondrous work to make a film handling with a seemingly overreached story in such a fascinating way and even offer some strong aftertaste for us to ruminate, a bravo job!

    English writer/director Mike Leigh's most successful film. Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white. Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a caf&eacute; in Holborn. The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet. The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard. The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.

    Secrets & Lies is the cold and sober truth after the relative joviality of Leigh's Life Is Sweet. The hangover, the wall of reality that hits you, in slowed down time. Not the same story or the same characters, of course. It's a slow absorbed process as each set of characters slowly and naturally unravel their stories. Through this somewhat sombre piece lie half a dozen or so people who possibly portray a more typical array of people in mid 90's London than usual, with some roles reversed from the stereotype. Hence the pivotal story of a young black professional woman seeking her blood mother after the death of her adoptive one. Brenda Blethin, giving a performance that always gives me a case of swallowing a lot - in both utter admiration and tingling connectivity as the white mother of her and her other white daughter, who happens to live awkwardly with her. Cynthia (Blethin) warms us with her typical East London hospitality and open-mindedness after the initial shock as the new mother and daughter explore each other's lives. Tim Spall, meanwhile, in complete contrast to his manic and accident prone 'restaurateur' in Life Is Sweet is a successful High Street photographer, methodically and professionally supporting his high- spending wife and their sumptuous suburban Lifestyle home. The reason for their emotional gap is brought to the fore as the fireworks go off over a family birthday barbecue. His relationship towards his sister Cynthia takes on a fresh but still emotionally distant renewal in the film. When I attended a scriptwriting course, I always wanted to add in each intonation, each exclamation mark. We were told that it's the actors and their interpretation that shape and form a script. If there was ever an advocate of this principle it is Mike Leigh. He is renowned for this and is often what film people talk of first when his name is mentioned. These are real people forming their own characters around a basic storyline and so they live and breath as them.

    A successful young black woman learns that the woman who gave her up for adoption is a working class white woman. While it takes a while to get going and it turns melodramatic at times, this comedy-drama is quite engaging. Leigh uses long takes for many of his scenes, letting the emotions build and adding a sense of realism to the interactions. He also elicits marvelous performances from his entire cast, who apparently were encouraged to improvise. Blethyn is superb as a woman with self-esteem issues who often carries on like a blithering idiot. Spall is likable as her supportive brother. Jean-Baptiste hits the right notes as the woman who seeks out her birth mother.

    "Secrets and Lies" is the suitable title for this movie as a dysfunctional family is about to have numerous secrets revealed to them. The secrets all comes alive when a black optometrist Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) pays a visit to her biological mother after her parents passed on. A social worker recommended not to seek out her real parents, but Hortense being passive of the warning decides to fulfill her search. Hortense phones her birth mother Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a frustrated factory worker who lives with her 20 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). After a series of disastrous phone calls, they finally get to to meet each other, much to the doubt in Cynthia's mind that she has a black daughter. And then suddenly, Cynthia starts to recall an event that happened to her a long time ago. We the audience are manipulated to believe that she was raped, but that was never really revealed. That's the uniqueness of director Mike Leigh's characters. They seem to have dark pasts that are really never touched. Another nice plus is that there is no racial issues between Hortense and her newly acquainted disjointed family. With the only exception being the doubt of Cynthia having a black daughter. As we follow Hortense on her journey, we also take focus on Cynthia's younger brother, Maurice (Timothy Spall) who's a successful photographer by profession. The movie itself isn't all drama and seriousness, there's plenty of humor added to the fray as well. One of the funnier moments is when Maurice is taking pictures of different people. The people behind those photographs gives you that felling of how they wish to be represented. Maurice has been estranged from his sister for quite a long time, mainly due to his cold, self-important wife Monica (Phyllis Logan). The pivotal moments happen when Hortense is invited to a barbecue and Cynthia decides to open up to the family revealing that Hortense is her daughter. Roxanne becomes distraught, Cynthia get emotional, and Maurice is at a loss of words. The dialogue of the movie title itself where the family is torn apart by the spilling of the beans doesn't offer much for the audience to draw up their own conclusions, but the overdone dialogue can be forgiven thanks mainly due to these earth-shattering revelations. With a group of lesser known performers, this movie would've been a dud. Sure the initiative in this movie was a bit painful to watch. The bombs that drop look like they're almost ready to explode. And we sympathize with Hortense by throwing the towel at her at what she's getting herself into. Bleak as the film might be, it still inspires you take take a closer look at your family and to say to yourself, that you are all very lucky. Every performer does an incredible performance with top honors to Blethyn, this movie will stick to your ribs for a long time to come.

Woody Allen overall made some very good movie with great smart comedic undertones that you can't help but highly praise, his mind is filled with things and talk and talks that makes most of his movies masterpieces. on the other hand, Mike Leigh seems to be on a track where he makes these quite smart and genius dramatic movies with natural and quite real characters with one or other problems still having comic feel to it. he have made some characters that you can't help but laugh at them even though later on they are the one that makes you cry. they are somewhat similar but Woody Allen being more into Comedy than Leigh being into dramatics but not bring quite over dramatic and leaving us with a feel of comic characters or moments. i saw it many weeks ago and i don't know whether i would be able to talk about it the way i should as i have been quite lazy in the past few weeks as these reviews are piling up on me. okay so the most favorite and perhaps mind blowing thing about this movie is performances. Leigh seems to get everything out of his actors and he knows it so well. he gives them freedom to improvise to get even more of them and their own feelings into the characters. one thing i read was that Brenda herself didn't knew that the character of Hortense is suppose to be Black, she wasn't told that by anyone thus making her reaction at that train station so unbelievably real. Brenda Blethyn according to me is one of the best actress ever or she got one of the best characters ever as Cynthia because what i saw in this movie totally blew my mind and every bit of me away. she is just mind blowing and powerful in this movie. i can't believe that she didn't got Oscar for this. there were so many scenes where what you see is the performance of her life. what she does is cry and cry in so many scenes and the way she talks is out if this world. she was someone i reacted to while watching the movie. i can't believe how much of a fan i am of her now that i saw her perform so amazing. i am going to put her in my list of Best performances soon. it was not just her but everyone else performed really good too. Marianne Jean-Baptiste was superb as a supporting actress in a role of a woman searching and finding herself, her identity, her life. she performed amazingly too and was very believable and absorbed in the characters. even being a black woman the scenes of her and Brenda were so amazing you could see the mother daughter interaction in a very real way. Timothy Spall as Cynthia's brother gave the best performance of his career, in the final scene at the family gathering where all the secrets and lies are revealed, the perfect shot that he gives as he speaks very loud and frustrated by all what is going on in contrast to what he have been doing for this family is epic. great and memorable performance by everyone. Screenplay of this movie is just spectacular in every aspect where you don't see a movie but astonishingly a real life footage or a documentary because all that goes on in the movie is something that happens. written greatly by Leigh i loved every bit of this movie. this movie is simple in the structure but leaves you thinking forever. the interaction of the characters are just epic in a way you don't see anything like this in movies nowadays where everything seems so synthetic. some breathtaking and heart stopping moments in the movie like that emotional scene in the bar where Cynthia and Hortense meets for the first time is one of the best moments i have seen in a movie. it is a 8 minutes single uninterrupted shot. the reaction of Cynthia and all the emotions are so authentic and real it leaves you wondering. what Brenda Blethyn does in that single shot crying, explaining, shocked, wondering, laughing, recalling her past, thinking about her family and all the tensions going on and what would happen is easily seen in her pure performance. and the final scenes where everything is revealed in the swirls of emotions, shouts and cries is mind blowing. This movie is completely flawless and wonderful drama that i think is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life. you will see real people in the actors and everything else that happens will leave you speechless. this is a movie that you must see.

    Arguably this is Mike Leigh's most popular film as it obtained 5 Oscar nominations (BEST ACTRESS, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST PICTURE, BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS and BEST ORIGINAL SCRIPT) and the Golden Palm in Cannes that year. I love Leigh's work very much and I previously watched VERA DRAKE (2004) and NAKED (1993), both brave and extraordinary. Still waiting to watch his recent pictures ANOTHER YEAR (2010) and HAPPY-GO-LUCKY (2008). The film itself burrows deep into the process of a successful black orphan looking for her birth mother (who is surprisingly set to be a low-class single white woman), arresting its audience with its slow pace of unraveling the back-story of their skin difference and their family. The warm-hearted tone is rare to behold in a Mike Leigh's film, and the happy ending ambiguously serves to leave its viewers a feel-good impression after the credits' rolling up. I must admit that it is a smart move, and expands itself to a wider demography. Surely Leigh's poignant portrayal of ordinary citizens is his trump card and renders a platform to allow the excellent cast to showcase their kaleidoscopic capabilities and leave its audience mesmerized. the Oscar-nominated mother-and-daughter pair (Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is deservingly splendid, especially Brenda, I rank her as my win that year, the strength and suffer of her character is so tangible when she is on screen; also Timothy Spall fully exposes his talent for his chubby but charming role as the younger brother of the mother. It is a wondrous work to make a film handling with a seemingly overreached story in such a fascinating way and even offer some strong aftertaste for us to ruminate, a bravo job!

    English writer/director Mike Leigh's most successful film. Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white. Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a caf&eacute; in Holborn. The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet. The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard. The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.

    Secrets & Lies is the cold and sober truth after the relative joviality of Leigh's Life Is Sweet. The hangover, the wall of reality that hits you, in slowed down time. Not the same story or the same characters, of course. It's a slow absorbed process as each set of characters slowly and naturally unravel their stories. Through this somewhat sombre piece lie half a dozen or so people who possibly portray a more typical array of people in mid 90's London than usual, with some roles reversed from the stereotype. Hence the pivotal story of a young black professional woman seeking her blood mother after the death of her adoptive one. Brenda Blethin, giving a performance that always gives me a case of swallowing a lot - in both utter admiration and tingling connectivity as the white mother of her and her other white daughter, who happens to live awkwardly with her. Cynthia (Blethin) warms us with her typical East London hospitality and open-mindedness after the initial shock as the new mother and daughter explore each other's lives. Tim Spall, meanwhile, in complete contrast to his manic and accident prone 'restaurateur' in Life Is Sweet is a successful High Street photographer, methodically and professionally supporting his high- spending wife and their sumptuous suburban Lifestyle home. The reason for their emotional gap is brought to the fore as the fireworks go off over a family birthday barbecue. His relationship towards his sister Cynthia takes on a fresh but still emotionally distant renewal in the film. When I attended a scriptwriting course, I always wanted to add in each intonation, each exclamation mark. We were told that it's the actors and their interpretation that shape and form a script. If there was ever an advocate of this principle it is Mike Leigh. He is renowned for this and is often what film people talk of first when his name is mentioned. These are real people forming their own characters around a basic storyline and so they live and breath as them.

    A successful young black woman learns that the woman who gave her up for adoption is a working class white woman. While it takes a while to get going and it turns melodramatic at times, this comedy-drama is quite engaging. Leigh uses long takes for many of his scenes, letting the emotions build and adding a sense of realism to the interactions. He also elicits marvelous performances from his entire cast, who apparently were encouraged to improvise. Blethyn is superb as a woman with self-esteem issues who often carries on like a blithering idiot. Spall is likable as her supportive brother. Jean-Baptiste hits the right notes as the woman who seeks out her birth mother.

    "Secrets and Lies" is the suitable title for this movie as a dysfunctional family is about to have numerous secrets revealed to them. The secrets all comes alive when a black optometrist Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) pays a visit to her biological mother after her parents passed on. A social worker recommended not to seek out her real parents, but Hortense being passive of the warning decides to fulfill her search. Hortense phones her birth mother Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a frustrated factory worker who lives with her 20 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). After a series of disastrous phone calls, they finally get to to meet each other, much to the doubt in Cynthia's mind that she has a black daughter. And then suddenly, Cynthia starts to recall an event that happened to her a long time ago. We the audience are manipulated to believe that she was raped, but that was never really revealed. That's the uniqueness of director Mike Leigh's characters. They seem to have dark pasts that are really never touched. Another nice plus is that there is no racial issues between Hortense and her newly acquainted disjointed family. With the only exception being the doubt of Cynthia having a black daughter. As we follow Hortense on her journey, we also take focus on Cynthia's younger brother, Maurice (Timothy Spall) who's a successful photographer by profession. The movie itself isn't all drama and seriousness, there's plenty of humor added to the fray as well. One of the funnier moments is when Maurice is taking pictures of different people. The people behind those photographs gives you that felling of how they wish to be represented. Maurice has been estranged from his sister for quite a long time, mainly due to his cold, self-important wife Monica (Phyllis Logan). The pivotal moments happen when Hortense is invited to a barbecue and Cynthia decides to open up to the family revealing that Hortense is her daughter. Roxanne becomes distraught, Cynthia get emotional, and Maurice is at a loss of words. The dialogue of the movie title itself where the family is torn apart by the spilling of the beans doesn't offer much for the audience to draw up their own conclusions, but the overdone dialogue can be forgiven thanks mainly due to these earth-shattering revelations. With a group of lesser known performers, this movie would've been a dud. Sure the initiative in this movie was a bit painful to watch. The bombs that drop look like they're almost ready to explode. And we sympathize with Hortense by throwing the towel at her at what she's getting herself into. Bleak as the film might be, it still inspires you take take a closer look at your family and to say to yourself, that you are all very lucky. Every performer does an incredible performance with top honors to Blethyn, this movie will stick to your ribs for a long time to come.

    Brenda Blethyn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Timothy Spall, Phyllis Logan, and Claire Rushbrook star in "Secrets & Lies," a 1996 film written and directed by Mike Leigh. The script is actually improvised, with the actors learning what the characters learn as they go along. Brenda Blethyn is Cynthia Rose Purley, a factory worker and single mother with an obnoxious daughter, Roxanne (Rushbrook). Cynthia is dependent for the occasional handout by her successful photographer brother, Maurice (Spall). Maurice lives in a lovely home with his wife (Logan); Cynthia can't stand her and the feeling is mutual. Maurice no longer has the relationship that he once had with his niece Roxanne, and this bothers him. Cynthia gets a call one day from a woman named Hortense Cumberbatch (Jean-Baptiste) who claims to be the daughter she gave up for adoption. After some hemming and hawing, Cynthia agrees to meet her at a subway stop. When she meets Hortense, she's shocked. Hortense is black. This is a wonderful, poignant, and funny story with just the right amount of drama and humor. The scene in the restaurant, when Cynthia says that Hortense couldn't possibly be her daughter because she's never been with a black man is absolutely priceless. The performances are tremendous. Brenda Blethyn is marvelous as the fragile, needy, eager to please Cynthia, though the character gets a bit annoying with her high-pitched voice and constant talking. Timothy Spall plays a big man with a big heart and will bring one to tears toward the end of the film. It was great to see Phyllis Logan from Lovejoy in such a marvelous role, and she does a great job. Marianne Jean-Baptiste is wonderful as a successful young woman who fights to keep her equilibrium when she's in the midst of a family explosion. Really enjoyed this -- and I guess the name Cumberbatch isn't as unusual as I thought.

    it'f life and direct.- and every thing that comes after this sentence is to convince the computer to accept my review. The problem is that I don't have to say much more about the film. It speaks for itself; life and direct... beautiful acting raw in the making. pretty brilliant. there it is... and the rest is about filling the requirement of a stupid machine that does not understand the spice in the shortness of a review. But then again, this is worth some time and to fill a couple of lines is no bother to me. And so I do it. Well I try at least. The line just came to me, and I think it fits. Watching a on popcorn film and don't worrying about time is a compliment in itself. What else, what else...

    At first it seems like a fairly routine family drama, but as these characters work their way under your skin, they develop rich complexities and rewarding relationships. The results are intensely moving, and I'm not ashamed to admit that by the end I was a blubbering wreck. Not a note of it seems phony, contrived or forced. There is no "Jeremy" character as in NAKED, every "villain" is imbued with true humanity. It seems almost criminal to single out any particular performance, as the cast is brilliant across the board. But I must say I was especially taken with the heartbreaking Brenda Blethyn and the utterly endearing Marianne Jean-Baptiste, two actresses who I've only seen in bit parts in far lesser works. If I were nitpicking, I'd say the Ron Cook (the photographer that Timothy Spall bought his studio from) scene is unnecessary and a bit out of place. It's not a bad scene at all, just a bit distracting. But other than that minor quibble, I adored it. A warm, touching, magnificent look at family, the barriers that keep them apart, and the roles and disguises we maintain for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is about lies that family members keep to each other. We start with three lines. We have a low-class woman, named Cynthia. She has a daughter (Roxanne) whom she seems to have a problematic relation. There are discussions, mostly about her dating a boy. Then we have Hortense, which is a grown up woman and a very brave one, who gets interest in knowing who her real mother is (since her adoptive mother died recently). In her research in the registry she finds out that her mother is Cynthia. Then , Hortense meets Cynthia, and they start to get along. During the story of Cynthia and Hortense, there's Maurice and Monica who are a married couple. Maurice is Cynthia's brother who does photography for a living. He and Monica have problems too. There's a lot of tension in the air. It is maybe a sign that something needs to be told. The tension culminates in Roxanne's birthday party, where Hortense is invited too. Roxanne is told that Hortense is her sister. Cynthia argues with Monica reminding her of older problems with money. Cynthia implies with Monica because of her not giving a child to his brother. Maurice explodes and tells everyone that Monica is infertile. This film is all about how people try to hide their ghosts, maybe thinking that they won't be a mess. We live in a society that makes us close to ourselves, and hide our emotions and past events. We try everyday to forget about them. But they are there, alive and they tend to come back. I found this movie very emotional and moral at the same time. The actors were incredible,and there seemed to be a little of theatrical scenes, like the scene where Cynthia and Hortense take a tea. I loved the acting in this movie. Congratulations Mike Leigh.

    English writer/director Mike Leigh's most successful film. Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white. Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a caf&eacute; in Holborn. The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet. The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard. The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.

Brenda Blethin, giving a performance that always gives me a case of swallowing a lot - in both utter admiration and tingling connectivity as the white mother of her and her other white daughter, who happens to live awkwardly with her. Cynthia (Blethin) warms us with her typical East London hospitality and open-mindedness after the initial shock as the new mother and daughter explore each other's lives. Tim Spall, meanwhile, in complete contrast to his manic and accident prone 'restaurateur' in Life Is Sweet is a successful High Street photographer, methodically and professionally supporting his high- spending wife and their sumptuous suburban Lifestyle home. The reason for their emotional gap is brought to the fore as the fireworks go off over a family birthday barbecue. His relationship towards his sister Cynthia takes on a fresh but still emotionally distant renewal in the film. When I attended a scriptwriting course, I always wanted to add in each intonation, each exclamation mark. We were told that it's the actors and their interpretation that shape and form a script. If there was ever an advocate of this principle it is Mike Leigh. He is renowned for this and is often what film people talk of first when his name is mentioned. These are real people forming their own characters around a basic storyline and so they live and breath as them.

    A successful young black woman learns that the woman who gave her up for adoption is a working class white woman. While it takes a while to get going and it turns melodramatic at times, this comedy-drama is quite engaging. Leigh uses long takes for many of his scenes, letting the emotions build and adding a sense of realism to the interactions. He also elicits marvelous performances from his entire cast, who apparently were encouraged to improvise. Blethyn is superb as a woman with self-esteem issues who often carries on like a blithering idiot. Spall is likable as her supportive brother. Jean-Baptiste hits the right notes as the woman who seeks out her birth mother.

    "Secrets and Lies" is the suitable title for this movie as a dysfunctional family is about to have numerous secrets revealed to them. The secrets all comes alive when a black optometrist Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) pays a visit to her biological mother after her parents passed on. A social worker recommended not to seek out her real parents, but Hortense being passive of the warning decides to fulfill her search. Hortense phones her birth mother Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a frustrated factory worker who lives with her 20 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). After a series of disastrous phone calls, they finally get to to meet each other, much to the doubt in Cynthia's mind that she has a black daughter. And then suddenly, Cynthia starts to recall an event that happened to her a long time ago. We the audience are manipulated to believe that she was raped, but that was never really revealed. That's the uniqueness of director Mike Leigh's characters. They seem to have dark pasts that are really never touched. Another nice plus is that there is no racial issues between Hortense and her newly acquainted disjointed family. With the only exception being the doubt of Cynthia having a black daughter. As we follow Hortense on her journey, we also take focus on Cynthia's younger brother, Maurice (Timothy Spall) who's a successful photographer by profession. The movie itself isn't all drama and seriousness, there's plenty of humor added to the fray as well. One of the funnier moments is when Maurice is taking pictures of different people. The people behind those photographs gives you that felling of how they wish to be represented. Maurice has been estranged from his sister for quite a long time, mainly due to his cold, self-important wife Monica (Phyllis Logan). The pivotal moments happen when Hortense is invited to a barbecue and Cynthia decides to open up to the family revealing that Hortense is her daughter. Roxanne becomes distraught, Cynthia get emotional, and Maurice is at a loss of words. The dialogue of the movie title itself where the family is torn apart by the spilling of the beans doesn't offer much for the audience to draw up their own conclusions, but the overdone dialogue can be forgiven thanks mainly due to these earth-shattering revelations. With a group of lesser known performers, this movie would've been a dud. Sure the initiative in this movie was a bit painful to watch. The bombs that drop look like they're almost ready to explode. And we sympathize with Hortense by throwing the towel at her at what she's getting herself into. Bleak as the film might be, it still inspires you take take a closer look at your family and to say to yourself, that you are all very lucky. Every performer does an incredible performance with top honors to Blethyn, this movie will stick to your ribs for a long time to come.

    Brenda Blethyn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Timothy Spall, Phyllis Logan, and Claire Rushbrook star in "Secrets & Lies," a 1996 film written and directed by Mike Leigh. The script is actually improvised, with the actors learning what the characters learn as they go along. Brenda Blethyn is Cynthia Rose Purley, a factory worker and single mother with an obnoxious daughter, Roxanne (Rushbrook). Cynthia is dependent for the occasional handout by her successful photographer brother, Maurice (Spall). Maurice lives in a lovely home with his wife (Logan); Cynthia can't stand her and the feeling is mutual. Maurice no longer has the relationship that he once had with his niece Roxanne, and this bothers him. Cynthia gets a call one day from a woman named Hortense Cumberbatch (Jean-Baptiste) who claims to be the daughter she gave up for adoption. After some hemming and hawing, Cynthia agrees to meet her at a subway stop. When she meets Hortense, she's shocked. Hortense is black. This is a wonderful, poignant, and funny story with just the right amount of drama and humor. The scene in the restaurant, when Cynthia says that Hortense couldn't possibly be her daughter because she's never been with a black man is absolutely priceless. The performances are tremendous. Brenda Blethyn is marvelous as the fragile, needy, eager to please Cynthia, though the character gets a bit annoying with her high-pitched voice and constant talking. Timothy Spall plays a big man with a big heart and will bring one to tears toward the end of the film. It was great to see Phyllis Logan from Lovejoy in such a marvelous role, and she does a great job. Marianne Jean-Baptiste is wonderful as a successful young woman who fights to keep her equilibrium when she's in the midst of a family explosion. Really enjoyed this -- and I guess the name Cumberbatch isn't as unusual as I thought.

It speaks for itself; life and direct... beautiful acting raw in the making. pretty brilliant. there it is... and the rest is about filling the requirement of a stupid machine that does not understand the spice in the shortness of a review. But then again, this is worth some time and to fill a couple of lines is no bother to me. And so I do it. Well I try at least. The line just came to me, and I think it fits.

    At first it seems like a fairly routine family drama, but as these characters work their way under your skin, they develop rich complexities and rewarding relationships. The results are intensely moving, and I'm not ashamed to admit that by the end I was a blubbering wreck. Not a note of it seems phony, contrived or forced. There is no "Jeremy" character as in NAKED, every "villain" is imbued with true humanity. It seems almost criminal to single out any particular performance, as the cast is brilliant across the board. But I must say I was especially taken with the heartbreaking Brenda Blethyn and the utterly endearing Marianne Jean-Baptiste, two actresses who I've only seen in bit parts in far lesser works. If I were nitpicking, I'd say the Ron Cook (the photographer that Timothy Spall bought his studio from) scene is unnecessary and a bit out of place. It's not a bad scene at all, just a bit distracting. But other than that minor quibble, I adored it. A warm, touching, magnificent look at family, the barriers that keep them apart, and the roles and disguises we maintain for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is about lies that family members keep to each other. We start with three lines. We have a low-class woman, named Cynthia. She has a daughter (Roxanne) whom she seems to have a problematic relation. There are discussions, mostly about her dating a boy. Then we have Hortense, which is a grown up woman and a very brave one, who gets interest in knowing who her real mother is (since her adoptive mother died recently). In her research in the registry she finds out that her mother is Cynthia. Then , Hortense meets Cynthia, and they start to get along. During the story of Cynthia and Hortense, there's Maurice and Monica who are a married couple. Maurice is Cynthia's brother who does photography for a living. He and Monica have problems too. There's a lot of tension in the air. It is maybe a sign that something needs to be told. The tension culminates in Roxanne's birthday party, where Hortense is invited too. Roxanne is told that Hortense is her sister. Cynthia argues with Monica reminding her of older problems with money. Cynthia implies with Monica because of her not giving a child to his brother. Maurice explodes and tells everyone that Monica is infertile. This film is all about how people try to hide their ghosts, maybe thinking that they won't be a mess. We live in a society that makes us close to ourselves, and hide our emotions and past events. We try everyday to forget about them. But they are there, alive and they tend to come back. I found this movie very emotional and moral at the same time. The actors were incredible,and there seemed to be a little of theatrical scenes, like the scene where Cynthia and Hortense take a tea. I loved the acting in this movie. Congratulations Mike Leigh.

    Review: i saw Another Year last year and was really impressed by Mike Leigh's enormous talent but most of all his unique and amazing style of filmmaking. i have seen Vera Drake a bit and will catch it soon but after watching this movie, i was stunned and surprised utterly by how flawless and mind blowing this movie was. Secrets & Lies is the reason why i am a big fan of Mike Leigh. he is a powerful film maker who gets the most out of his actors, something which lacks very much in everyone today. he is a very intelligent and classy director of this time that might reminds you of the geniuses of past. i think it is just great for anyone to tackle subjects that are so real among human beings and to have a such deeper approach towards society is just amazing though most film makers seems to avoid this kind of view in their movies. Woody Allen overall made some very good movie with great smart comedic undertones that you can't help but highly praise, his mind is filled with things and talk and talks that makes most of his movies masterpieces. on the other hand, Mike Leigh seems to be on a track where he makes these quite smart and genius dramatic movies with natural and quite real characters with one or other problems still having comic feel to it. he have made some characters that you can't help but laugh at them even though later on they are the one that makes you cry. they are somewhat similar but Woody Allen being more into Comedy than Leigh being into dramatics but not bring quite over dramatic and leaving us with a feel of comic characters or moments. i saw it many weeks ago and i don't know whether i would be able to talk about it the way i should as i have been quite lazy in the past few weeks as these reviews are piling up on me. okay so the most favorite and perhaps mind blowing thing about this movie is performances. Leigh seems to get everything out of his actors and he knows it so well. he gives them freedom to improvise to get even more of them and their own feelings into the characters. one thing i read was that Brenda herself didn't knew that the character of Hortense is suppose to be Black, she wasn't told that by anyone thus making her reaction at that train station so unbelievably real. Brenda Blethyn according to me is one of the best actress ever or she got one of the best characters ever as Cynthia because what i saw in this movie totally blew my mind and every bit of me away. she is just mind blowing and powerful in this movie. i can't believe that she didn't got Oscar for this. there were so many scenes where what you see is the performance of her life. what she does is cry and cry in so many scenes and the way she talks is out if this world. she was someone i reacted to while watching the movie. i can't believe how much of a fan i am of her now that i saw her perform so amazing. i am going to put her in my list of Best performances soon. it was not just her but everyone else performed really good too. Marianne Jean-Baptiste was superb as a supporting actress in a role of a woman searching and finding herself, her identity, her life. she performed amazingly too and was very believable and absorbed in the characters. even being a black woman the scenes of her and Brenda were so amazing you could see the mother daughter interaction in a very real way. Timothy Spall as Cynthia's brother gave the best performance of his career, in the final scene at the family gathering where all the secrets and lies are revealed, the perfect shot that he gives as he speaks very loud and frustrated by all what is going on in contrast to what he have been doing for this family is epic. great and memorable performance by everyone. Screenplay of this movie is just spectacular in every aspect where you don't see a movie but astonishingly a real life footage or a documentary because all that goes on in the movie is something that happens. written greatly by Leigh i loved every bit of this movie. this movie is simple in the structure but leaves you thinking forever. the interaction of the characters are just epic in a way you don't see anything like this in movies nowadays where everything seems so synthetic. some breathtaking and heart stopping moments in the movie like that emotional scene in the bar where Cynthia and Hortense meets for the first time is one of the best moments i have seen in a movie. it is a 8 minutes single uninterrupted shot. the reaction of Cynthia and all the emotions are so authentic and real it leaves you wondering. what Brenda Blethyn does in that single shot crying, explaining, shocked, wondering, laughing, recalling her past, thinking about her family and all the tensions going on and what would happen is easily seen in her pure performance. and the final scenes where everything is revealed in the swirls of emotions, shouts and cries is mind blowing. This movie is completely flawless and wonderful drama that i think is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life. you will see real people in the actors and everything else that happens will leave you speechless. this is a movie that you must see.

    Arguably this is Mike Leigh's most popular film as it obtained 5 Oscar nominations (BEST ACTRESS, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST PICTURE, BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS and BEST ORIGINAL SCRIPT) and the Golden Palm in Cannes that year. I love Leigh's work very much and I previously watched VERA DRAKE (2004) and NAKED (1993), both brave and extraordinary. Still waiting to watch his recent pictures ANOTHER YEAR (2010) and HAPPY-GO-LUCKY (2008). The film itself burrows deep into the process of a successful black orphan looking for her birth mother (who is surprisingly set to be a low-class single white woman), arresting its audience with its slow pace of unraveling the back-story of their skin difference and their family. The warm-hearted tone is rare to behold in a Mike Leigh's film, and the happy ending ambiguously serves to leave its viewers a feel-good impression after the credits' rolling up. I must admit that it is a smart move, and expands itself to a wider demography. Surely Leigh's poignant portrayal of ordinary citizens is his trump card and renders a platform to allow the excellent cast to showcase their kaleidoscopic capabilities and leave its audience mesmerized. the Oscar-nominated mother-and-daughter pair (Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is deservingly splendid, especially Brenda, I rank her as my win that year, the strength and suffer of her character is so tangible when she is on screen; also Timothy Spall fully exposes his talent for his chubby but charming role as the younger brother of the mother. It is a wondrous work to make a film handling with a seemingly overreached story in such a fascinating way and even offer some strong aftertaste for us to ruminate, a bravo job!

    English writer/director Mike Leigh's most successful film. Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white. Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a caf&eacute; in Holborn. The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet. The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard. The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.

    Secrets & Lies is the cold and sober truth after the relative joviality of Leigh's Life Is Sweet. The hangover, the wall of reality that hits you, in slowed down time. Not the same story or the same characters, of course. It's a slow absorbed process as each set of characters slowly and naturally unravel their stories. Through this somewhat sombre piece lie half a dozen or so people who possibly portray a more typical array of people in mid 90's London than usual, with some roles reversed from the stereotype. Hence the pivotal story of a young black professional woman seeking her blood mother after the death of her adoptive one. Brenda Blethin, giving a performance that always gives me a case of swallowing a lot - in both utter admiration and tingling connectivity as the white mother of her and her other white daughter, who happens to live awkwardly with her. Cynthia (Blethin) warms us with her typical East London hospitality and open-mindedness after the initial shock as the new mother and daughter explore each other's lives. Tim Spall, meanwhile, in complete contrast to his manic and accident prone 'restaurateur' in Life Is Sweet is a successful High Street photographer, methodically and professionally supporting his high- spending wife and their sumptuous suburban Lifestyle home. The reason for their emotional gap is brought to the fore as the fireworks go off over a family birthday barbecue. His relationship towards his sister Cynthia takes on a fresh but still emotionally distant renewal in the film. When I attended a scriptwriting course, I always wanted to add in each intonation, each exclamation mark. We were told that it's the actors and their interpretation that shape and form a script. If there was ever an advocate of this principle it is Mike Leigh. He is renowned for this and is often what film people talk of first when his name is mentioned. These are real people forming their own characters around a basic storyline and so they live and breath as them.

    A successful young black woman learns that the woman who gave her up for adoption is a working class white woman. While it takes a while to get going and it turns melodramatic at times, this comedy-drama is quite engaging. Leigh uses long takes for many of his scenes, letting the emotions build and adding a sense of realism to the interactions. He also elicits marvelous performances from his entire cast, who apparently were encouraged to improvise. Blethyn is superb as a woman with self-esteem issues who often carries on like a blithering idiot. Spall is likable as her supportive brother. Jean-Baptiste hits the right notes as the woman who seeks out her birth mother.

    This movie is about lies that family members keep to each other. We start with three lines. We have a low-class woman, named Cynthia. She has a daughter (Roxanne) whom she seems to have a problematic relation. There are discussions, mostly about her dating a boy. Then we have Hortense, which is a grown up woman and a very brave one, who gets interest in knowing who her real mother is (since her adoptive mother died recently). In her research in the registry she finds out that her mother is Cynthia. Then , Hortense meets Cynthia, and they start to get along. During the story of Cynthia and Hortense, there's Maurice and Monica who are a married couple. Maurice is Cynthia's brother who does photography for a living. He and Monica have problems too. There's a lot of tension in the air. It is maybe a sign that something needs to be told. The tension culminates in Roxanne's birthday party, where Hortense is invited too. Roxanne is told that Hortense is her sister. Cynthia argues with Monica reminding her of older problems with money. Cynthia implies with Monica because of her not giving a child to his brother. Maurice explodes and tells everyone that Monica is infertile. This film is all about how people try to hide their ghosts, maybe thinking that they won't be a mess. We live in a society that makes us close to ourselves, and hide our emotions and past events. We try everyday to forget about them. But they are there, alive and they tend to come back. I found this movie very emotional and moral at the same time. The actors were incredible,and there seemed to be a little of theatrical scenes, like the scene where Cynthia and Hortense take a tea. I loved the acting in this movie. Congratulations Mike Leigh.

    Review: i saw Another Year last year and was really impressed by Mike Leigh's enormous talent but most of all his unique and amazing style of filmmaking. i have seen Vera Drake a bit and will catch it soon but after watching this movie, i was stunned and surprised utterly by how flawless and mind blowing this movie was. Secrets & Lies is the reason why i am a big fan of Mike Leigh. he is a powerful film maker who gets the most out of his actors, something which lacks very much in everyone today. he is a very intelligent and classy director of this time that might reminds you of the geniuses of past. i think it is just great for anyone to tackle subjects that are so real among human beings and to have a such deeper approach towards society is just amazing though most film makers seems to avoid this kind of view in their movies. Woody Allen overall made some very good movie with great smart comedic undertones that you can't help but highly praise, his mind is filled with things and talk and talks that makes most of his movies masterpieces. on the other hand, Mike Leigh seems to be on a track where he makes these quite smart and genius dramatic movies with natural and quite real characters with one or other problems still having comic feel to it. he have made some characters that you can't help but laugh at them even though later on they are the one that makes you cry. they are somewhat similar but Woody Allen being more into Comedy than Leigh being into dramatics but not bring quite over dramatic and leaving us with a feel of comic characters or moments. i saw it many weeks ago and i don't know whether i would be able to talk about it the way i should as i have been quite lazy in the past few weeks as these reviews are piling up on me. okay so the most favorite and perhaps mind blowing thing about this movie is performances. Leigh seems to get everything out of his actors and he knows it so well. he gives them freedom to improvise to get even more of them and their own feelings into the characters. one thing i read was that Brenda herself didn't knew that the character of Hortense is suppose to be Black, she wasn't told that by anyone thus making her reaction at that train station so unbelievably real. Brenda Blethyn according to me is one of the best actress ever or she got one of the best characters ever as Cynthia because what i saw in this movie totally blew my mind and every bit of me away. she is just mind blowing and powerful in this movie. i can't believe that she didn't got Oscar for this. there were so many scenes where what you see is the performance of her life. what she does is cry and cry in so many scenes and the way she talks is out if this world. she was someone i reacted to while watching the movie. i can't believe how much of a fan i am of her now that i saw her perform so amazing. i am going to put her in my list of Best performances soon. it was not just her but everyone else performed really good too. Marianne Jean-Baptiste was superb as a supporting actress in a role of a woman searching and finding herself, her identity, her life. she performed amazingly too and was very believable and absorbed in the characters. even being a black woman the scenes of her and Brenda were so amazing you could see the mother daughter interaction in a very real way. Timothy Spall as Cynthia's brother gave the best performance of his career, in the final scene at the family gathering where all the secrets and lies are revealed, the perfect shot that he gives as he speaks very loud and frustrated by all what is going on in contrast to what he have been doing for this family is epic. great and memorable performance by everyone. Screenplay of this movie is just spectacular in every aspect where you don't see a movie but astonishingly a real life footage or a documentary because all that goes on in the movie is something that happens. written greatly by Leigh i loved every bit of this movie. this movie is simple in the structure but leaves you thinking forever. the interaction of the characters are just epic in a way you don't see anything like this in movies nowadays where everything seems so synthetic. some breathtaking and heart stopping moments in the movie like that emotional scene in the bar where Cynthia and Hortense meets for the first time is one of the best moments i have seen in a movie. it is a 8 minutes single uninterrupted shot. the reaction of Cynthia and all the emotions are so authentic and real it leaves you wondering. what Brenda Blethyn does in that single shot crying, explaining, shocked, wondering, laughing, recalling her past, thinking about her family and all the tensions going on and what would happen is easily seen in her pure performance. and the final scenes where everything is revealed in the swirls of emotions, shouts and cries is mind blowing. This movie is completely flawless and wonderful drama that i think is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life. you will see real people in the actors and everything else that happens will leave you speechless. this is a movie that you must see.

    Arguably this is Mike Leigh's most popular film as it obtained 5 Oscar nominations (BEST ACTRESS, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST PICTURE, BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS and BEST ORIGINAL SCRIPT) and the Golden Palm in Cannes that year. I love Leigh's work very much and I previously watched VERA DRAKE (2004) and NAKED (1993), both brave and extraordinary. Still waiting to watch his recent pictures ANOTHER YEAR (2010) and HAPPY-GO-LUCKY (2008). The film itself burrows deep into the process of a successful black orphan looking for her birth mother (who is surprisingly set to be a low-class single white woman), arresting its audience with its slow pace of unraveling the back-story of their skin difference and their family. The warm-hearted tone is rare to behold in a Mike Leigh's film, and the happy ending ambiguously serves to leave its viewers a feel-good impression after the credits' rolling up. I must admit that it is a smart move, and expands itself to a wider demography. Surely Leigh's poignant portrayal of ordinary citizens is his trump card and renders a platform to allow the excellent cast to showcase their kaleidoscopic capabilities and leave its audience mesmerized. the Oscar-nominated mother-and-daughter pair (Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is deservingly splendid, especially Brenda, I rank her as my win that year, the strength and suffer of her character is so tangible when she is on screen; also Timothy Spall fully exposes his talent for his chubby but charming role as the younger brother of the mother. It is a wondrous work to make a film handling with a seemingly overreached story in such a fascinating way and even offer some strong aftertaste for us to ruminate, a bravo job!

    English writer/director Mike Leigh's most successful film. Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white. Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a caf&eacute; in Holborn. The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet. The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard. The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.

    Secrets & Lies is the cold and sober truth after the relative joviality of Leigh's Life Is Sweet. The hangover, the wall of reality that hits you, in slowed down time. Not the same story or the same characters, of course. It's a slow absorbed process as each set of characters slowly and naturally unravel their stories. Through this somewhat sombre piece lie half a dozen or so people who possibly portray a more typical array of people in mid 90's London than usual, with some roles reversed from the stereotype. Hence the pivotal story of a young black professional woman seeking her blood mother after the death of her adoptive one. Brenda Blethin, giving a performance that always gives me a case of swallowing a lot - in both utter admiration and tingling connectivity as the white mother of her and her other white daughter, who happens to live awkwardly with her. Cynthia (Blethin) warms us with her typical East London hospitality and open-mindedness after the initial shock as the new mother and daughter explore each other's lives. Tim Spall, meanwhile, in complete contrast to his manic and accident prone 'restaurateur' in Life Is Sweet is a successful High Street photographer, methodically and professionally supporting his high- spending wife and their sumptuous suburban Lifestyle home. The reason for their emotional gap is brought to the fore as the fireworks go off over a family birthday barbecue. His relationship towards his sister Cynthia takes on a fresh but still emotionally distant renewal in the film. When I attended a scriptwriting course, I always wanted to add in each intonation, each exclamation mark. We were told that it's the actors and their interpretation that shape and form a script. If there was ever an advocate of this principle it is Mike Leigh. He is renowned for this and is often what film people talk of first when his name is mentioned. These are real people forming their own characters around a basic storyline and so they live and breath as them.

    A successful young black woman learns that the woman who gave her up for adoption is a working class white woman. While it takes a while to get going and it turns melodramatic at times, this comedy-drama is quite engaging. Leigh uses long takes for many of his scenes, letting the emotions build and adding a sense of realism to the interactions. He also elicits marvelous performances from his entire cast, who apparently were encouraged to improvise. Blethyn is superb as a woman with self-esteem issues who often carries on like a blithering idiot. Spall is likable as her supportive brother. Jean-Baptiste hits the right notes as the woman who seeks out her birth mother.

    "Secrets and Lies" is the suitable title for this movie as a dysfunctional family is about to have numerous secrets revealed to them. The secrets all comes alive when a black optometrist Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) pays a visit to her biological mother after her parents passed on. A social worker recommended not to seek out her real parents, but Hortense being passive of the warning decides to fulfill her search. Hortense phones her birth mother Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a frustrated factory worker who lives with her 20 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). After a series of disastrous phone calls, they finally get to to meet each other, much to the doubt in Cynthia's mind that she has a black daughter. And then suddenly, Cynthia starts to recall an event that happened to her a long time ago. We the audience are manipulated to believe that she was raped, but that was never really revealed. That's the uniqueness of director Mike Leigh's characters. They seem to have dark pasts that are really never touched. Another nice plus is that there is no racial issues between Hortense and her newly acquainted disjointed family. With the only exception being the doubt of Cynthia having a black daughter. As we follow Hortense on her journey, we also take focus on Cynthia's younger brother, Maurice (Timothy Spall) who's a successful photographer by profession. The movie itself isn't all drama and seriousness, there's plenty of humor added to the fray as well. One of the funnier moments is when Maurice is taking pictures of different people. The people behind those photographs gives you that felling of how they wish to be represented. Maurice has been estranged from his sister for quite a long time, mainly due to his cold, self-important wife Monica (Phyllis Logan). The pivotal moments happen when Hortense is invited to a barbecue and Cynthia decides to open up to the family revealing that Hortense is her daughter. Roxanne becomes distraught, Cynthia get emotional, and Maurice is at a loss of words. The dialogue of the movie title itself where the family is torn apart by the spilling of the beans doesn't offer much for the audience to draw up their own conclusions, but the overdone dialogue can be forgiven thanks mainly due to these earth-shattering revelations. With a group of lesser known performers, this movie would've been a dud. Sure the initiative in this movie was a bit painful to watch. The bombs that drop look like they're almost ready to explode. And we sympathize with Hortense by throwing the towel at her at what she's getting herself into. Bleak as the film might be, it still inspires you take take a closer look at your family and to say to yourself, that you are all very lucky. Every performer does an incredible performance with top honors to Blethyn, this movie will stick to your ribs for a long time to come.

    Brenda Blethyn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Timothy Spall, Phyllis Logan, and Claire Rushbrook star in "Secrets & Lies," a 1996 film written and directed by Mike Leigh. The script is actually improvised, with the actors learning what the characters learn as they go along. Brenda Blethyn is Cynthia Rose Purley, a factory worker and single mother with an obnoxious daughter, Roxanne (Rushbrook). Cynthia is dependent for the occasional handout by her successful photographer brother, Maurice (Spall). Maurice lives in a lovely home with his wife (Logan); Cynthia can't stand her and the feeling is mutual. Maurice no longer has the relationship that he once had with his niece Roxanne, and this bothers him. Cynthia gets a call one day from a woman named Hortense Cumberbatch (Jean-Baptiste) who claims to be the daughter she gave up for adoption. After some hemming and hawing, Cynthia agrees to meet her at a subway stop. When she meets Hortense, she's shocked. Hortense is black. This is a wonderful, poignant, and funny story with just the right amount of drama and humor. The scene in the restaurant, when Cynthia says that Hortense couldn't possibly be her daughter because she's never been with a black man is absolutely priceless. The performances are tremendous. Brenda Blethyn is marvelous as the fragile, needy, eager to please Cynthia, though the character gets a bit annoying with her high-pitched voice and constant talking. Timothy Spall plays a big man with a big heart and will bring one to tears toward the end of the film. It was great to see Phyllis Logan from Lovejoy in such a marvelous role, and she does a great job. Marianne Jean-Baptiste is wonderful as a successful young woman who fights to keep her equilibrium when she's in the midst of a family explosion. Really enjoyed this -- and I guess the name Cumberbatch isn't as unusual as I thought.

    it'f life and direct.- and every thing that comes after this sentence is to convince the computer to accept my review. The problem is that I don't have to say much more about the film. It speaks for itself; life and direct... beautiful acting raw in the making. pretty brilliant. there it is... and the rest is about filling the requirement of a stupid machine that does not understand the spice in the shortness of a review. But then again, this is worth some time and to fill a couple of lines is no bother to me. And so I do it. Well I try at least. The line just came to me, and I think it fits. Watching a on popcorn film and don't worrying about time is a compliment in itself. What else, what else...

    At first it seems like a fairly routine family drama, but as these characters work their way under your skin, they develop rich complexities and rewarding relationships. The results are intensely moving, and I'm not ashamed to admit that by the end I was a blubbering wreck. Not a note of it seems phony, contrived or forced. There is no "Jeremy" character as in NAKED, every "villain" is imbued with true humanity. It seems almost criminal to single out any particular performance, as the cast is brilliant across the board. But I must say I was especially taken with the heartbreaking Brenda Blethyn and the utterly endearing Marianne Jean-Baptiste, two actresses who I've only seen in bit parts in far lesser works. If I were nitpicking, I'd say the Ron Cook (the photographer that Timothy Spall bought his studio from) scene is unnecessary and a bit out of place. It's not a bad scene at all, just a bit distracting. But other than that minor quibble, I adored it. A warm, touching, magnificent look at family, the barriers that keep them apart, and the roles and disguises we maintain for all the wrong reasons.

    English writer/director Mike Leigh's most successful film. Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white. Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a caf&eacute; in Holborn. The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet. The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard. The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.

    Secrets & Lies is the cold and sober truth after the relative joviality of Leigh's Life Is Sweet. The hangover, the wall of reality that hits you, in slowed down time. Not the same story or the same characters, of course. It's a slow absorbed process as each set of characters slowly and naturally unravel their stories. Through this somewhat sombre piece lie half a dozen or so people who possibly portray a more typical array of people in mid 90's London than usual, with some roles reversed from the stereotype. Hence the pivotal story of a young black professional woman seeking her blood mother after the death of her adoptive one. Brenda Blethin, giving a performance that always gives me a case of swallowing a lot - in both utter admiration and tingling connectivity as the white mother of her and her other white daughter, who happens to live awkwardly with her. Cynthia (Blethin) warms us with her typical East London hospitality and open-mindedness after the initial shock as the new mother and daughter explore each other's lives. Tim Spall, meanwhile, in complete contrast to his manic and accident prone 'restaurateur' in Life Is Sweet is a successful High Street photographer, methodically and professionally supporting his high- spending wife and their sumptuous suburban Lifestyle home. The reason for their emotional gap is brought to the fore as the fireworks go off over a family birthday barbecue. His relationship towards his sister Cynthia takes on a fresh but still emotionally distant renewal in the film. When I attended a scriptwriting course, I always wanted to add in each intonation, each exclamation mark. We were told that it's the actors and their interpretation that shape and form a script. If there was ever an advocate of this principle it is Mike Leigh. He is renowned for this and is often what film people talk of first when his name is mentioned. These are real people forming their own characters around a basic storyline and so they live and breath as them.

    A successful young black woman learns that the woman who gave her up for adoption is a working class white woman. While it takes a while to get going and it turns melodramatic at times, this comedy-drama is quite engaging. Leigh uses long takes for many of his scenes, letting the emotions build and adding a sense of realism to the interactions. He also elicits marvelous performances from his entire cast, who apparently were encouraged to improvise. Blethyn is superb as a woman with self-esteem issues who often carries on like a blithering idiot. Spall is likable as her supportive brother. Jean-Baptiste hits the right notes as the woman who seeks out her birth mother.

    "Secrets and Lies" is the suitable title for this movie as a dysfunctional family is about to have numerous secrets revealed to them. The secrets all comes alive when a black optometrist Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) pays a visit to her biological mother after her parents passed on. A social worker recommended not to seek out her real parents, but Hortense being passive of the warning decides to fulfill her search. Hortense phones her birth mother Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a frustrated factory worker who lives with her 20 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). After a series of disastrous phone calls, they finally get to to meet each other, much to the doubt in Cynthia's mind that she has a black daughter. And then suddenly, Cynthia starts to recall an event that happened to her a long time ago. We the audience are manipulated to believe that she was raped, but that was never really revealed. That's the uniqueness of director Mike Leigh's characters. They seem to have dark pasts that are really never touched. Another nice plus is that there is no racial issues between Hortense and her newly acquainted disjointed family. With the only exception being the doubt of Cynthia having a black daughter. As we follow Hortense on her journey, we also take focus on Cynthia's younger brother, Maurice (Timothy Spall) who's a successful photographer by profession. The movie itself isn't all drama and seriousness, there's plenty of humor added to the fray as well. One of the funnier moments is when Maurice is taking pictures of different people. The people behind those photographs gives you that felling of how they wish to be represented. Maurice has been estranged from his sister for quite a long time, mainly due to his cold, self-important wife Monica (Phyllis Logan). The pivotal moments happen when Hortense is invited to a barbecue and Cynthia decides to open up to the family revealing that Hortense is her daughter. Roxanne becomes distraught, Cynthia get emotional, and Maurice is at a loss of words. The dialogue of the movie title itself where the family is torn apart by the spilling of the beans doesn't offer much for the audience to draw up their own conclusions, but the overdone dialogue can be forgiven thanks mainly due to these earth-shattering revelations. With a group of lesser known performers, this movie would've been a dud. Sure the initiative in this movie was a bit painful to watch. The bombs that drop look like they're almost ready to explode. And we sympathize with Hortense by throwing the towel at her at what she's getting herself into. Bleak as the film might be, it still inspires you take take a closer look at your family and to say to yourself, that you are all very lucky. Every performer does an incredible performance with top honors to Blethyn, this movie will stick to your ribs for a long time to come.

    Brenda Blethyn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Timothy Spall, Phyllis Logan, and Claire Rushbrook star in "Secrets & Lies," a 1996 film written and directed by Mike Leigh. The script is actually improvised, with the actors learning what the characters learn as they go along. Brenda Blethyn is Cynthia Rose Purley, a factory worker and single mother with an obnoxious daughter, Roxanne (Rushbrook). Cynthia is dependent for the occasional handout by her successful photographer brother, Maurice (Spall). Maurice lives in a lovely home with his wife (Logan); Cynthia can't stand her and the feeling is mutual. Maurice no longer has the relationship that he once had with his niece Roxanne, and this bothers him. Cynthia gets a call one day from a woman named Hortense Cumberbatch (Jean-Baptiste) who claims to be the daughter she gave up for adoption. After some hemming and hawing, Cynthia agrees to meet her at a subway stop. When she meets Hortense, she's shocked. Hortense is black. This is a wonderful, poignant, and funny story with just the right amount of drama and humor. The scene in the restaurant, when Cynthia says that Hortense couldn't possibly be her daughter because she's never been with a black man is absolutely priceless. The performances are tremendous. Brenda Blethyn is marvelous as the fragile, needy, eager to please Cynthia, though the character gets a bit annoying with her high-pitched voice and constant talking. Timothy Spall plays a big man with a big heart and will bring one to tears toward the end of the film. It was great to see Phyllis Logan from Lovejoy in such a marvelous role, and she does a great job. Marianne Jean-Baptiste is wonderful as a successful young woman who fights to keep her equilibrium when she's in the midst of a family explosion. Really enjoyed this -- and I guess the name Cumberbatch isn't as unusual as I thought.

    it'f life and direct.- and every thing that comes after this sentence is to convince the computer to accept my review. The problem is that I don't have to say much more about the film. It speaks for itself; life and direct... beautiful acting raw in the making. pretty brilliant. there it is... and the rest is about filling the requirement of a stupid machine that does not understand the spice in the shortness of a review. But then again, this is worth some time and to fill a couple of lines is no bother to me. And so I do it. Well I try at least. The line just came to me, and I think it fits. Watching a on popcorn film and don't worrying about time is a compliment in itself. What else, what else...

    At first it seems like a fairly routine family drama, but as these characters work their way under your skin, they develop rich complexities and rewarding relationships. The results are intensely moving, and I'm not ashamed to admit that by the end I was a blubbering wreck. Not a note of it seems phony, contrived or forced. There is no "Jeremy" character as in NAKED, every "villain" is imbued with true humanity. It seems almost criminal to single out any particular performance, as the cast is brilliant across the board. But I must say I was especially taken with the heartbreaking Brenda Blethyn and the utterly endearing Marianne Jean-Baptiste, two actresses who I've only seen in bit parts in far lesser works. If I were nitpicking, I'd say the Ron Cook (the photographer that Timothy Spall bought his studio from) scene is unnecessary and a bit out of place. It's not a bad scene at all, just a bit distracting. But other than that minor quibble, I adored it. A warm, touching, magnificent look at family, the barriers that keep them apart, and the roles and disguises we maintain for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is about lies that family members keep to each other. We start with three lines. We have a low-class woman, named Cynthia. She has a daughter (Roxanne) whom she seems to have a problematic relation. There are discussions, mostly about her dating a boy. Then we have Hortense, which is a grown up woman and a very brave one, who gets interest in knowing who her real mother is (since her adoptive mother died recently). In her research in the registry she finds out that her mother is Cynthia. Then , Hortense meets Cynthia, and they start to get along. During the story of Cynthia and Hortense, there's Maurice and Monica who are a married couple. Maurice is Cynthia's brother who does photography for a living. He and Monica have problems too. There's a lot of tension in the air. It is maybe a sign that something needs to be told. The tension culminates in Roxanne's birthday party, where Hortense is invited too. Roxanne is told that Hortense is her sister. Cynthia argues with Monica reminding her of older problems with money. Cynthia implies with Monica because of her not giving a child to his brother. Maurice explodes and tells everyone that Monica is infertile. This film is all about how people try to hide their ghosts, maybe thinking that they won't be a mess. We live in a society that makes us close to ourselves, and hide our emotions and past events. We try everyday to forget about them. But they are there, alive and they tend to come back. I found this movie very emotional and moral at the same time. The actors were incredible,and there seemed to be a little of theatrical scenes, like the scene where Cynthia and Hortense take a tea. I loved the acting in this movie. Congratulations Mike Leigh.

    Review: i saw Another Year last year and was really impressed by Mike Leigh's enormous talent but most of all his unique and amazing style of filmmaking. i have seen Vera Drake a bit and will catch it soon but after watching this movie, i was stunned and surprised utterly by how flawless and mind blowing this movie was. Secrets & Lies is the reason why i am a big fan of Mike Leigh. he is a powerful film maker who gets the most out of his actors, something which lacks very much in everyone today. he is a very intelligent and classy director of this time that might reminds you of the geniuses of past. i think it is just great for anyone to tackle subjects that are so real among human beings and to have a such deeper approach towards society is just amazing though most film makers seems to avoid this kind of view in their movies. Woody Allen overall made some very good movie with great smart comedic undertones that you can't help but highly praise, his mind is filled with things and talk and talks that makes most of his movies masterpieces. on the other hand, Mike Leigh seems to be on a track where he makes these quite smart and genius dramatic movies with natural and quite real characters with one or other problems still having comic feel to it. he have made some characters that you can't help but laugh at them even though later on they are the one that makes you cry. they are somewhat similar but Woody Allen being more into Comedy than Leigh being into dramatics but not bring quite over dramatic and leaving us with a feel of comic characters or moments. i saw it many weeks ago and i don't know whether i would be able to talk about it the way i should as i have been quite lazy in the past few weeks as these reviews are piling up on me. okay so the most favorite and perhaps mind blowing thing about this movie is performances. Leigh seems to get everything out of his actors and he knows it so well. he gives them freedom to improvise to get even more of them and their own feelings into the characters. one thing i read was that Brenda herself didn't knew that the character of Hortense is suppose to be Black, she wasn't told that by anyone thus making her reaction at that train station so unbelievably real. Brenda Blethyn according to me is one of the best actress ever or she got one of the best characters ever as Cynthia because what i saw in this movie totally blew my mind and every bit of me away. she is just mind blowing and powerful in this movie. i can't believe that she didn't got Oscar for this. there were so many scenes where what you see is the performance of her life. what she does is cry and cry in so many scenes and the way she talks is out if this world. she was someone i reacted to while watching the movie. i can't believe how much of a fan i am of her now that i saw her perform so amazing. i am going to put her in my list of Best performances soon. it was not just her but everyone else performed really good too. Marianne Jean-Baptiste was superb as a supporting actress in a role of a woman searching and finding herself, her identity, her life. she performed amazingly too and was very believable and absorbed in the characters. even being a black woman the scenes of her and Brenda were so amazing you could see the mother daughter interaction in a very real way. Timothy Spall as Cynthia's brother gave the best performance of his career, in the final scene at the family gathering where all the secrets and lies are revealed, the perfect shot that he gives as he speaks very loud and frustrated by all what is going on in contrast to what he have been doing for this family is epic. great and memorable performance by everyone. Screenplay of this movie is just spectacular in every aspect where you don't see a movie but astonishingly a real life footage or a documentary because all that goes on in the movie is something that happens. written greatly by Leigh i loved every bit of this movie. this movie is simple in the structure but leaves you thinking forever. the interaction of the characters are just epic in a way you don't see anything like this in movies nowadays where everything seems so synthetic. some breathtaking and heart stopping moments in the movie like that emotional scene in the bar where Cynthia and Hortense meets for the first time is one of the best moments i have seen in a movie. it is a 8 minutes single uninterrupted shot. the reaction of Cynthia and all the emotions are so authentic and real it leaves you wondering. what Brenda Blethyn does in that single shot crying, explaining, shocked, wondering, laughing, recalling her past, thinking about her family and all the tensions going on and what would happen is easily seen in her pure performance. and the final scenes where everything is revealed in the swirls of emotions, shouts and cries is mind blowing. This movie is completely flawless and wonderful drama that i think is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life. you will see real people in the actors and everything else that happens will leave you speechless. this is a movie that you must see.

    Arguably this is Mike Leigh's most popular film as it obtained 5 Oscar nominations (BEST ACTRESS, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST PICTURE, BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS and BEST ORIGINAL SCRIPT) and the Golden Palm in Cannes that year. I love Leigh's work very much and I previously watched VERA DRAKE (2004) and NAKED (1993), both brave and extraordinary. Still waiting to watch his recent pictures ANOTHER YEAR (2010) and HAPPY-GO-LUCKY (2008). The film itself burrows deep into the process of a successful black orphan looking for her birth mother (who is surprisingly set to be a low-class single white woman), arresting its audience with its slow pace of unraveling the back-story of their skin difference and their family. The warm-hearted tone is rare to behold in a Mike Leigh's film, and the happy ending ambiguously serves to leave its viewers a feel-good impression after the credits' rolling up. I must admit that it is a smart move, and expands itself to a wider demography. Surely Leigh's poignant portrayal of ordinary citizens is his trump card and renders a platform to allow the excellent cast to showcase their kaleidoscopic capabilities and leave its audience mesmerized. the Oscar-nominated mother-and-daughter pair (Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is deservingly splendid, especially Brenda, I rank her as my win that year, the strength and suffer of her character is so tangible when she is on screen; also Timothy Spall fully exposes his talent for his chubby but charming role as the younger brother of the mother. It is a wondrous work to make a film handling with a seemingly overreached story in such a fascinating way and even offer some strong aftertaste for us to ruminate, a bravo job!

    English writer/director Mike Leigh's most successful film. Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white. Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a caf&eacute; in Holborn. The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet. The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard. The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.

    it'f life and direct.- and every thing that comes after this sentence is to convince the computer to accept my review. The problem is that I don't have to say much more about the film. It speaks for itself; life and direct... beautiful acting raw in the making. pretty brilliant. there it is... and the rest is about filling the requirement of a stupid machine that does not understand the spice in the shortness of a review. But then again, this is worth some time and to fill a couple of lines is no bother to me. And so I do it. Well I try at least. The line just came to me, and I think it fits. Watching a on popcorn film and don't worrying about time is a compliment in itself. What else, what else...

    At first it seems like a fairly routine family drama, but as these characters work their way under your skin, they develop rich complexities and rewarding relationships. The results are intensely moving, and I'm not ashamed to admit that by the end I was a blubbering wreck. Not a note of it seems phony, contrived or forced. There is no "Jeremy" character as in NAKED, every "villain" is imbued with true humanity. It seems almost criminal to single out any particular performance, as the cast is brilliant across the board. But I must say I was especially taken with the heartbreaking Brenda Blethyn and the utterly endearing Marianne Jean-Baptiste, two actresses who I've only seen in bit parts in far lesser works. If I were nitpicking, I'd say the Ron Cook (the photographer that Timothy Spall bought his studio from) scene is unnecessary and a bit out of place. It's not a bad scene at all, just a bit distracting. But other than that minor quibble, I adored it. A warm, touching, magnificent look at family, the barriers that keep them apart, and the roles and disguises we maintain for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is about lies that family members keep to each other. We start with three lines. We have a low-class woman, named Cynthia. She has a daughter (Roxanne) whom she seems to have a problematic relation. There are discussions, mostly about her dating a boy. Then we have Hortense, which is a grown up woman and a very brave one, who gets interest in knowing who her real mother is (since her adoptive mother died recently). In her research in the registry she finds out that her mother is Cynthia. Then , Hortense meets Cynthia, and they start to get along. During the story of Cynthia and Hortense, there's Maurice and Monica who are a married couple. Maurice is Cynthia's brother who does photography for a living. He and Monica have problems too. There's a lot of tension in the air. It is maybe a sign that something needs to be told. The tension culminates in Roxanne's birthday party, where Hortense is invited too. Roxanne is told that Hortense is her sister. Cynthia argues with Monica reminding her of older problems with money. Cynthia implies with Monica because of her not giving a child to his brother. Maurice explodes and tells everyone that Monica is infertile. This film is all about how people try to hide their ghosts, maybe thinking that they won't be a mess. We live in a society that makes us close to ourselves, and hide our emotions and past events. We try everyday to forget about them. But they are there, alive and they tend to come back. I found this movie very emotional and moral at the same time. The actors were incredible,and there seemed to be a little of theatrical scenes, like the scene where Cynthia and Hortense take a tea. I loved the acting in this movie. Congratulations Mike Leigh.

    Review: i saw Another Year last year and was really impressed by Mike Leigh's enormous talent but most of all his unique and amazing style of filmmaking. i have seen Vera Drake a bit and will catch it soon but after watching this movie, i was stunned and surprised utterly by how flawless and mind blowing this movie was. Secrets & Lies is the reason why i am a big fan of Mike Leigh. he is a powerful film maker who gets the most out of his actors, something which lacks very much in everyone today. he is a very intelligent and classy director of this time that might reminds you of the geniuses of past. i think it is just great for anyone to tackle subjects that are so real among human beings and to have a such deeper approach towards society is just amazing though most film makers seems to avoid this kind of view in their movies. Woody Allen overall made some very good movie with great smart comedic undertones that you can't help but highly praise, his mind is filled with things and talk and talks that makes most of his movies masterpieces. on the other hand, Mike Leigh seems to be on a track where he makes these quite smart and genius dramatic movies with natural and quite real characters with one or other problems still having comic feel to it. he have made some characters that you can't help but laugh at them even though later on they are the one that makes you cry. they are somewhat similar but Woody Allen being more into Comedy than Leigh being into dramatics but not bring quite over dramatic and leaving us with a feel of comic characters or moments. i saw it many weeks ago and i don't know whether i would be able to talk about it the way i should as i have been quite lazy in the past few weeks as these reviews are piling up on me. okay so the most favorite and perhaps mind blowing thing about this movie is performances. Leigh seems to get everything out of his actors and he knows it so well. he gives them freedom to improvise to get even more of them and their own feelings into the characters. one thing i read was that Brenda herself didn't knew that the character of Hortense is suppose to be Black, she wasn't told that by anyone thus making her reaction at that train station so unbelievably real. Brenda Blethyn according to me is one of the best actress ever or she got one of the best characters ever as Cynthia because what i saw in this movie totally blew my mind and every bit of me away. she is just mind blowing and powerful in this movie. i can't believe that she didn't got Oscar for this. there were so many scenes where what you see is the performance of her life. what she does is cry and cry in so many scenes and the way she talks is out if this world. she was someone i reacted to while watching the movie. i can't believe how much of a fan i am of her now that i saw her perform so amazing. i am going to put her in my list of Best performances soon. it was not just her but everyone else performed really good too. Marianne Jean-Baptiste was superb as a supporting actress in a role of a woman searching and finding herself, her identity, her life. she performed amazingly too and was very believable and absorbed in the characters. even being a black woman the scenes of her and Brenda were so amazing you could see the mother daughter interaction in a very real way. Timothy Spall as Cynthia's brother gave the best performance of his career, in the final scene at the family gathering where all the secrets and lies are revealed, the perfect shot that he gives as he speaks very loud and frustrated by all what is going on in contrast to what he have been doing for this family is epic. great and memorable performance by everyone. Screenplay of this movie is just spectacular in every aspect where you don't see a movie but astonishingly a real life footage or a documentary because all that goes on in the movie is something that happens. written greatly by Leigh i loved every bit of this movie. this movie is simple in the structure but leaves you thinking forever. the interaction of the characters are just epic in a way you don't see anything like this in movies nowadays where everything seems so synthetic. some breathtaking and heart stopping moments in the movie like that emotional scene in the bar where Cynthia and Hortense meets for the first time is one of the best moments i have seen in a movie. it is a 8 minutes single uninterrupted shot. the reaction of Cynthia and all the emotions are so authentic and real it leaves you wondering. what Brenda Blethyn does in that single shot crying, explaining, shocked, wondering, laughing, recalling her past, thinking about her family and all the tensions going on and what would happen is easily seen in her pure performance. and the final scenes where everything is revealed in the swirls of emotions, shouts and cries is mind blowing. This movie is completely flawless and wonderful drama that i think is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life. you will see real people in the actors and everything else that happens will leave you speechless. this is a movie that you must see.

    Arguably this is Mike Leigh's most popular film as it obtained 5 Oscar nominations (BEST ACTRESS, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST PICTURE, BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS and BEST ORIGINAL SCRIPT) and the Golden Palm in Cannes that year. I love Leigh's work very much and I previously watched VERA DRAKE (2004) and NAKED (1993), both brave and extraordinary. Still waiting to watch his recent pictures ANOTHER YEAR (2010) and HAPPY-GO-LUCKY (2008). The film itself burrows deep into the process of a successful black orphan looking for her birth mother (who is surprisingly set to be a low-class single white woman), arresting its audience with its slow pace of unraveling the back-story of their skin difference and their family. The warm-hearted tone is rare to behold in a Mike Leigh's film, and the happy ending ambiguously serves to leave its viewers a feel-good impression after the credits' rolling up. I must admit that it is a smart move, and expands itself to a wider demography. Surely Leigh's poignant portrayal of ordinary citizens is his trump card and renders a platform to allow the excellent cast to showcase their kaleidoscopic capabilities and leave its audience mesmerized. the Oscar-nominated mother-and-daughter pair (Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is deservingly splendid, especially Brenda, I rank her as my win that year, the strength and suffer of her character is so tangible when she is on screen; also Timothy Spall fully exposes his talent for his chubby but charming role as the younger brother of the mother. It is a wondrous work to make a film handling with a seemingly overreached story in such a fascinating way and even offer some strong aftertaste for us to ruminate, a bravo job!

    English writer/director Mike Leigh's most successful film. Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white. Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a caf&eacute; in Holborn. The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet. The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard. The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.

    Secrets & Lies is the cold and sober truth after the relative joviality of Leigh's Life Is Sweet. The hangover, the wall of reality that hits you, in slowed down time. Not the same story or the same characters, of course. It's a slow absorbed process as each set of characters slowly and naturally unravel their stories. Through this somewhat sombre piece lie half a dozen or so people who possibly portray a more typical array of people in mid 90's London than usual, with some roles reversed from the stereotype. Hence the pivotal story of a young black professional woman seeking her blood mother after the death of her adoptive one. Brenda Blethin, giving a performance that always gives me a case of swallowing a lot - in both utter admiration and tingling connectivity as the white mother of her and her other white daughter, who happens to live awkwardly with her. Cynthia (Blethin) warms us with her typical East London hospitality and open-mindedness after the initial shock as the new mother and daughter explore each other's lives. Tim Spall, meanwhile, in complete contrast to his manic and accident prone 'restaurateur' in Life Is Sweet is a successful High Street photographer, methodically and professionally supporting his high- spending wife and their sumptuous suburban Lifestyle home. The reason for their emotional gap is brought to the fore as the fireworks go off over a family birthday barbecue. His relationship towards his sister Cynthia takes on a fresh but still emotionally distant renewal in the film. When I attended a scriptwriting course, I always wanted to add in each intonation, each exclamation mark. We were told that it's the actors and their interpretation that shape and form a script. If there was ever an advocate of this principle it is Mike Leigh. He is renowned for this and is often what film people talk of first when his name is mentioned. These are real people forming their own characters around a basic storyline and so they live and breath as them.

    A successful young black woman learns that the woman who gave her up for adoption is a working class white woman. While it takes a while to get going and it turns melodramatic at times, this comedy-drama is quite engaging. Leigh uses long takes for many of his scenes, letting the emotions build and adding a sense of realism to the interactions. He also elicits marvelous performances from his entire cast, who apparently were encouraged to improvise. Blethyn is superb as a woman with self-esteem issues who often carries on like a blithering idiot. Spall is likable as her supportive brother. Jean-Baptiste hits the right notes as the woman who seeks out her birth mother.

    "Secrets and Lies" is the suitable title for this movie as a dysfunctional family is about to have numerous secrets revealed to them. The secrets all comes alive when a black optometrist Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) pays a visit to her biological mother after her parents passed on. A social worker recommended not to seek out her real parents, but Hortense being passive of the warning decides to fulfill her search. Hortense phones her birth mother Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a frustrated factory worker who lives with her 20 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). After a series of disastrous phone calls, they finally get to to meet each other, much to the doubt in Cynthia's mind that she has a black daughter. And then suddenly, Cynthia starts to recall an event that happened to her a long time ago. We the audience are manipulated to believe that she was raped, but that was never really revealed. That's the uniqueness of director Mike Leigh's characters. They seem to have dark pasts that are really never touched. Another nice plus is that there is no racial issues between Hortense and her newly acquainted disjointed family. With the only exception being the doubt of Cynthia having a black daughter. As we follow Hortense on her journey, we also take focus on Cynthia's younger brother, Maurice (Timothy Spall) who's a successful photographer by profession. The movie itself isn't all drama and seriousness, there's plenty of humor added to the fray as well. One of the funnier moments is when Maurice is taking pictures of different people. The people behind those photographs gives you that felling of how they wish to be represented. Maurice has been estranged from his sister for quite a long time, mainly due to his cold, self-important wife Monica (Phyllis Logan). The pivotal moments happen when Hortense is invited to a barbecue and Cynthia decides to open up to the family revealing that Hortense is her daughter. Roxanne becomes distraught, Cynthia get emotional, and Maurice is at a loss of words. The dialogue of the movie title itself where the family is torn apart by the spilling of the beans doesn't offer much for the audience to draw up their own conclusions, but the overdone dialogue can be forgiven thanks mainly due to these earth-shattering revelations. With a group of lesser known performers, this movie would've been a dud. Sure the initiative in this movie was a bit painful to watch. The bombs that drop look like they're almost ready to explode. And we sympathize with Hortense by throwing the towel at her at what she's getting herself into. Bleak as the film might be, it still inspires you take take a closer look at your family and to say to yourself, that you are all very lucky. Every performer does an incredible performance with top honors to Blethyn, this movie will stick to your ribs for a long time to come.

    Brenda Blethyn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Timothy Spall, Phyllis Logan, and Claire Rushbrook star in "Secrets & Lies," a 1996 film written and directed by Mike Leigh. The script is actually improvised, with the actors learning what the characters learn as they go along. Brenda Blethyn is Cynthia Rose Purley, a factory worker and single mother with an obnoxious daughter, Roxanne (Rushbrook). Cynthia is dependent for the occasional handout by her successful photographer brother, Maurice (Spall). Maurice lives in a lovely home with his wife (Logan); Cynthia can't stand her and the feeling is mutual. Maurice no longer has the relationship that he once had with his niece Roxanne, and this bothers him. Cynthia gets a call one day from a woman named Hortense Cumberbatch (Jean-Baptiste) who claims to be the daughter she gave up for adoption. After some hemming and hawing, Cynthia agrees to meet her at a subway stop. When she meets Hortense, she's shocked. Hortense is black. This is a wonderful, poignant, and funny story with just the right amount of drama and humor. The scene in the restaurant, when Cynthia says that Hortense couldn't possibly be her daughter because she's never been with a black man is absolutely priceless. The performances are tremendous. Brenda Blethyn is marvelous as the fragile, needy, eager to please Cynthia, though the character gets a bit annoying with her high-pitched voice and constant talking. Timothy Spall plays a big man with a big heart and will bring one to tears toward the end of the film. It was great to see Phyllis Logan from Lovejoy in such a marvelous role, and she does a great job. Marianne Jean-Baptiste is wonderful as a successful young woman who fights to keep her equilibrium when she's in the midst of a family explosion. Really enjoyed this -- and I guess the name Cumberbatch isn't as unusual as I thought.

The warm-hearted tone is rare to behold in a Mike Leigh's film, and the happy ending ambiguously serves to leave its viewers a feel-good impression after the credits' rolling up. I must admit that it is a smart move, and expands itself to a wider demography. Surely Leigh's poignant portrayal of ordinary citizens is his trump card and renders a platform to allow the excellent cast to showcase their kaleidoscopic capabilities and leave its audience mesmerized. the Oscar-nominated mother-and-daughter pair (Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is deservingly splendid, especially Brenda, I rank her as my win that year, the strength and suffer of her character is so tangible when she is on screen; also Timothy Spall fully exposes his talent for his chubby but charming role as the younger brother of the mother. It is a wondrous work to make a film handling with a seemingly overreached story in such a fascinating way and even offer some strong aftertaste for us to ruminate, a bravo job!

    English writer/director Mike Leigh's most successful film. Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white. Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a caf&eacute; in Holborn. The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet. The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard. The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.

    Secrets & Lies is the cold and sober truth after the relative joviality of Leigh's Life Is Sweet. The hangover, the wall of reality that hits you, in slowed down time. Not the same story or the same characters, of course. It's a slow absorbed process as each set of characters slowly and naturally unravel their stories. Through this somewhat sombre piece lie half a dozen or so people who possibly portray a more typical array of people in mid 90's London than usual, with some roles reversed from the stereotype. Hence the pivotal story of a young black professional woman seeking her blood mother after the death of her adoptive one. Brenda Blethin, giving a performance that always gives me a case of swallowing a lot - in both utter admiration and tingling connectivity as the white mother of her and her other white daughter, who happens to live awkwardly with her. Cynthia (Blethin) warms us with her typical East London hospitality and open-mindedness after the initial shock as the new mother and daughter explore each other's lives. Tim Spall, meanwhile, in complete contrast to his manic and accident prone 'restaurateur' in Life Is Sweet is a successful High Street photographer, methodically and professionally supporting his high- spending wife and their sumptuous suburban Lifestyle home. The reason for their emotional gap is brought to the fore as the fireworks go off over a family birthday barbecue. His relationship towards his sister Cynthia takes on a fresh but still emotionally distant renewal in the film. When I attended a scriptwriting course, I always wanted to add in each intonation, each exclamation mark. We were told that it's the actors and their interpretation that shape and form a script. If there was ever an advocate of this principle it is Mike Leigh. He is renowned for this and is often what film people talk of first when his name is mentioned. These are real people forming their own characters around a basic storyline and so they live and breath as them.

    A successful young black woman learns that the woman who gave her up for adoption is a working class white woman. While it takes a while to get going and it turns melodramatic at times, this comedy-drama is quite engaging. Leigh uses long takes for many of his scenes, letting the emotions build and adding a sense of realism to the interactions. He also elicits marvelous performances from his entire cast, who apparently were encouraged to improvise. Blethyn is superb as a woman with self-esteem issues who often carries on like a blithering idiot. Spall is likable as her supportive brother. Jean-Baptiste hits the right notes as the woman who seeks out her birth mother.

    "Secrets and Lies" is the suitable title for this movie as a dysfunctional family is about to have numerous secrets revealed to them. The secrets all comes alive when a black optometrist Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) pays a visit to her biological mother after her parents passed on. A social worker recommended not to seek out her real parents, but Hortense being passive of the warning decides to fulfill her search. Hortense phones her birth mother Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a frustrated factory worker who lives with her 20 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). After a series of disastrous phone calls, they finally get to to meet each other, much to the doubt in Cynthia's mind that she has a black daughter. And then suddenly, Cynthia starts to recall an event that happened to her a long time ago. We the audience are manipulated to believe that she was raped, but that was never really revealed. That's the uniqueness of director Mike Leigh's characters. They seem to have dark pasts that are really never touched. Another nice plus is that there is no racial issues between Hortense and her newly acquainted disjointed family. With the only exception being the doubt of Cynthia having a black daughter. As we follow Hortense on her journey, we also take focus on Cynthia's younger brother, Maurice (Timothy Spall) who's a successful photographer by profession. The movie itself isn't all drama and seriousness, there's plenty of humor added to the fray as well. One of the funnier moments is when Maurice is taking pictures of different people. The people behind those photographs gives you that felling of how they wish to be represented. Maurice has been estranged from his sister for quite a long time, mainly due to his cold, self-important wife Monica (Phyllis Logan). The pivotal moments happen when Hortense is invited to a barbecue and Cynthia decides to open up to the family revealing that Hortense is her daughter. Roxanne becomes distraught, Cynthia get emotional, and Maurice is at a loss of words. The dialogue of the movie title itself where the family is torn apart by the spilling of the beans doesn't offer much for the audience to draw up their own conclusions, but the overdone dialogue can be forgiven thanks mainly due to these earth-shattering revelations. With a group of lesser known performers, this movie would've been a dud. Sure the initiative in this movie was a bit painful to watch. The bombs that drop look like they're almost ready to explode. And we sympathize with Hortense by throwing the towel at her at what she's getting herself into. Bleak as the film might be, it still inspires you take take a closer look at your family and to say to yourself, that you are all very lucky. Every performer does an incredible performance with top honors to Blethyn, this movie will stick to your ribs for a long time to come.

    Brenda Blethyn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Timothy Spall, Phyllis Logan, and Claire Rushbrook star in "Secrets & Lies," a 1996 film written and directed by Mike Leigh. The script is actually improvised, with the actors learning what the characters learn as they go along. Brenda Blethyn is Cynthia Rose Purley, a factory worker and single mother with an obnoxious daughter, Roxanne (Rushbrook). Cynthia is dependent for the occasional handout by her successful photographer brother, Maurice (Spall). Maurice lives in a lovely home with his wife (Logan); Cynthia can't stand her and the feeling is mutual. Maurice no longer has the relationship that he once had with his niece Roxanne, and this bothers him. Cynthia gets a call one day from a woman named Hortense Cumberbatch (Jean-Baptiste) who claims to be the daughter she gave up for adoption. After some hemming and hawing, Cynthia agrees to meet her at a subway stop. When she meets Hortense, she's shocked. Hortense is black. This is a wonderful, poignant, and funny story with just the right amount of drama and humor. The scene in the restaurant, when Cynthia says that Hortense couldn't possibly be her daughter because she's never been with a black man is absolutely priceless. The performances are tremendous. Brenda Blethyn is marvelous as the fragile, needy, eager to please Cynthia, though the character gets a bit annoying with her high-pitched voice and constant talking. Timothy Spall plays a big man with a big heart and will bring one to tears toward the end of the film. It was great to see Phyllis Logan from Lovejoy in such a marvelous role, and she does a great job. Marianne Jean-Baptiste is wonderful as a successful young woman who fights to keep her equilibrium when she's in the midst of a family explosion. Really enjoyed this -- and I guess the name Cumberbatch isn't as unusual as I thought.

    it'f life and direct.- and every thing that comes after this sentence is to convince the computer to accept my review. The problem is that I don't have to say much more about the film. It speaks for itself; life and direct... beautiful acting raw in the making. pretty brilliant. there it is... and the rest is about filling the requirement of a stupid machine that does not understand the spice in the shortness of a review. But then again, this is worth some time and to fill a couple of lines is no bother to me. And so I do it. Well I try at least. The line just came to me, and I think it fits. Watching a on popcorn film and don't worrying about time is a compliment in itself. What else, what else...

    At first it seems like a fairly routine family drama, but as these characters work their way under your skin, they develop rich complexities and rewarding relationships. The results are intensely moving, and I'm not ashamed to admit that by the end I was a blubbering wreck. Not a note of it seems phony, contrived or forced. There is no "Jeremy" character as in NAKED, every "villain" is imbued with true humanity. It seems almost criminal to single out any particular performance, as the cast is brilliant across the board. But I must say I was especially taken with the heartbreaking Brenda Blethyn and the utterly endearing Marianne Jean-Baptiste, two actresses who I've only seen in bit parts in far lesser works. If I were nitpicking, I'd say the Ron Cook (the photographer that Timothy Spall bought his studio from) scene is unnecessary and a bit out of place. It's not a bad scene at all, just a bit distracting. But other than that minor quibble, I adored it. A warm, touching, magnificent look at family, the barriers that keep them apart, and the roles and disguises we maintain for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is about lies that family members keep to each other. We start with three lines. We have a low-class woman, named Cynthia. She has a daughter (Roxanne) whom she seems to have a problematic relation. There are discussions, mostly about her dating a boy. Then we have Hortense, which is a grown up woman and a very brave one, who gets interest in knowing who her real mother is (since her adoptive mother died recently). In her research in the registry she finds out that her mother is Cynthia. Then , Hortense meets Cynthia, and they start to get along. During the story of Cynthia and Hortense, there's Maurice and Monica who are a married couple. Maurice is Cynthia's brother who does photography for a living. He and Monica have problems too. There's a lot of tension in the air. It is maybe a sign that something needs to be told. The tension culminates in Roxanne's birthday party, where Hortense is invited too. Roxanne is told that Hortense is her sister. Cynthia argues with Monica reminding her of older problems with money. Cynthia implies with Monica because of her not giving a child to his brother. Maurice explodes and tells everyone that Monica is infertile. This film is all about how people try to hide their ghosts, maybe thinking that they won't be a mess. We live in a society that makes us close to ourselves, and hide our emotions and past events. We try everyday to forget about them. But they are there, alive and they tend to come back. I found this movie very emotional and moral at the same time. The actors were incredible,and there seemed to be a little of theatrical scenes, like the scene where Cynthia and Hortense take a tea. I loved the acting in this movie. Congratulations Mike Leigh.

    Review: i saw Another Year last year and was really impressed by Mike Leigh's enormous talent but most of all his unique and amazing style of filmmaking. i have seen Vera Drake a bit and will catch it soon but after watching this movie, i was stunned and surprised utterly by how flawless and mind blowing this movie was. Secrets & Lies is the reason why i am a big fan of Mike Leigh. he is a powerful film maker who gets the most out of his actors, something which lacks very much in everyone today. he is a very intelligent and classy director of this time that might reminds you of the geniuses of past. i think it is just great for anyone to tackle subjects that are so real among human beings and to have a such deeper approach towards society is just amazing though most film makers seems to avoid this kind of view in their movies. Woody Allen overall made some very good movie with great smart comedic undertones that you can't help but highly praise, his mind is filled with things and talk and talks that makes most of his movies masterpieces. on the other hand, Mike Leigh seems to be on a track where he makes these quite smart and genius dramatic movies with natural and quite real characters with one or other problems still having comic feel to it. he have made some characters that you can't help but laugh at them even though later on they are the one that makes you cry. they are somewhat similar but Woody Allen being more into Comedy than Leigh being into dramatics but not bring quite over dramatic and leaving us with a feel of comic characters or moments. i saw it many weeks ago and i don't know whether i would be able to talk about it the way i should as i have been quite lazy in the past few weeks as these reviews are piling up on me. okay so the most favorite and perhaps mind blowing thing about this movie is performances. Leigh seems to get everything out of his actors and he knows it so well. he gives them freedom to improvise to get even more of them and their own feelings into the characters. one thing i read was that Brenda herself didn't knew that the character of Hortense is suppose to be Black, she wasn't told that by anyone thus making her reaction at that train station so unbelievably real. Brenda Blethyn according to me is one of the best actress ever or she got one of the best characters ever as Cynthia because what i saw in this movie totally blew my mind and every bit of me away. she is just mind blowing and powerful in this movie. i can't believe that she didn't got Oscar for this. there were so many scenes where what you see is the performance of her life. what she does is cry and cry in so many scenes and the way she talks is out if this world. she was someone i reacted to while watching the movie. i can't believe how much of a fan i am of her now that i saw her perform so amazing. i am going to put her in my list of Best performances soon. it was not just her but everyone else performed really good too. Marianne Jean-Baptiste was superb as a supporting actress in a role of a woman searching and finding herself, her identity, her life. she performed amazingly too and was very believable and absorbed in the characters. even being a black woman the scenes of her and Brenda were so amazing you could see the mother daughter interaction in a very real way. Timothy Spall as Cynthia's brother gave the best performance of his career, in the final scene at the family gathering where all the secrets and lies are revealed, the perfect shot that he gives as he speaks very loud and frustrated by all what is going on in contrast to what he have been doing for this family is epic. great and memorable performance by everyone. Screenplay of this movie is just spectacular in every aspect where you don't see a movie but astonishingly a real life footage or a documentary because all that goes on in the movie is something that happens. written greatly by Leigh i loved every bit of this movie. this movie is simple in the structure but leaves you thinking forever. the interaction of the characters are just epic in a way you don't see anything like this in movies nowadays where everything seems so synthetic. some breathtaking and heart stopping moments in the movie like that emotional scene in the bar where Cynthia and Hortense meets for the first time is one of the best moments i have seen in a movie. it is a 8 minutes single uninterrupted shot. the reaction of Cynthia and all the emotions are so authentic and real it leaves you wondering. what Brenda Blethyn does in that single shot crying, explaining, shocked, wondering, laughing, recalling her past, thinking about her family and all the tensions going on and what would happen is easily seen in her pure performance. and the final scenes where everything is revealed in the swirls of emotions, shouts and cries is mind blowing. This movie is completely flawless and wonderful drama that i think is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life. you will see real people in the actors and everything else that happens will leave you speechless. this is a movie that you must see.

    Arguably this is Mike Leigh's most popular film as it obtained 5 Oscar nominations (BEST ACTRESS, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST PICTURE, BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS and BEST ORIGINAL SCRIPT) and the Golden Palm in Cannes that year. I love Leigh's work very much and I previously watched VERA DRAKE (2004) and NAKED (1993), both brave and extraordinary. Still waiting to watch his recent pictures ANOTHER YEAR (2010) and HAPPY-GO-LUCKY (2008). The film itself burrows deep into the process of a successful black orphan looking for her birth mother (who is surprisingly set to be a low-class single white woman), arresting its audience with its slow pace of unraveling the back-story of their skin difference and their family. The warm-hearted tone is rare to behold in a Mike Leigh's film, and the happy ending ambiguously serves to leave its viewers a feel-good impression after the credits' rolling up. I must admit that it is a smart move, and expands itself to a wider demography. Surely Leigh's poignant portrayal of ordinary citizens is his trump card and renders a platform to allow the excellent cast to showcase their kaleidoscopic capabilities and leave its audience mesmerized. the Oscar-nominated mother-and-daughter pair (Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is deservingly splendid, especially Brenda, I rank her as my win that year, the strength and suffer of her character is so tangible when she is on screen; also Timothy Spall fully exposes his talent for his chubby but charming role as the younger brother of the mother.

    English writer/director Mike Leigh's most successful film. Back in 1996 it won the Palm D'Or and Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival and three BAFTAs (Best British Film, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). SECRETS AND LIES features Brenda Blethyn as Cynitha, a permanently emotional, low intellect and anxious single mother in her late 40s living with her 21 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). Cynthia is down-trodden, smokes and bursts into tears a lot. This happens a great deal because her long lost daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) appears from nowhere. She's a likable and easy-to-relate to 27-year old optician. Hortense's adoptive mother had died, so she set off to find her biological one. But Hortense is black and Cynthia is white. Leigh's strength is the roundedness of his characters. His film is a pithy observation of mid-1990s London life - part heartwarming and part tragic. In his previous film NAKED, London was shot in washed out and drab colours during winter. Here, everything seems bright and drenched in summer sunshine to reflect the more humane mood. The other principle character is Maurice (Timothy Spall), Cynthia's bearded bear of a brother who is a successful photographer. The best scenes are of his clients posing for the camera (including Alison Steadman - Leigh's ex-wife - as a dog owner). Other memorable moments include an encounter between Maurice and the person he bought the business from (Ron Peck), who is now an embittered drunk. Also, a lengthy unbroken single take of almost 8 minutes as Hortense and Cynthia meet for the first time at a caf&eacute; in Holborn. The interiors of the houses speak volumes about the social divisions in 1990s England. Maurice and his wife live in colour-scheme luxury (three bedrooms, a four-poster bed); Cynthia and her daughter live in a dilapidated hovel still with an outdoor toilet. The climax takes place at Maurice's house on Roxanne's 21st birthday. Cynthia reveals Hortense's identity to everyone. This is a shock for Roxanne and Maurice, then Maurice - previously calmly understated - makes a passionate speech about how much better everyone would be if they didn't keep secrets from each other. Hortense was determined to discover the truth and take the consequences. There is much tears and hugging before the happy resolution with Cynthia, Hortense and Roxanne all sitting together reconciled in Cynthia's back yard. The details of the acting, camera work and art direction in this film demand a second viewing for full appreciation of its excellence.
