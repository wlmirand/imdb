    Hitchcock was a master of his craft- everyone is aware of that- and his ideas revolutionized and popularized the thriller genre, one of my personal favorites. Skimming through his rich filmography, every addition is fueled by unmatched suspense. This is no different with one of Hitchcock's highly-acclaimed classics, Read Window. The film promises so much potential with its opening act in which the camera is technically the first participant and onlooker as it manages to give us a considerable amount of backstory without any verbal language in its first five minutes or so. It carefully observes a fascinating environment/setting- one in which every neighbor's life is visible through their open windows. The way the set was built and is in appearance is simply genius and (almost) never was the set of a film as crucial to its story and themes as it is here. Right from the get-go, you witness an underlying theme in that this picture conveys the isolated and individualistic nature of neighborhoods in our current world. No one seems to be interested in their neighbors besides Jeff (and he even mentions this in one of his clever lines) so much so that they aren't even concerned about what they're actually partaking in those rooms of theirs; the neighbors are never aware anyways. However, on the opposite side, it can be argued that people in current society are frankly too obsessed with another's conversation or activities. Apparently, we stick our noses in everyone's business, and it can be argued on a political scale as well. We do, in fact, watch our foreign neighbors far too closely with invasive binoculars, and in this manner, Jeff could actually be perceived as the villain of Rear Window in a way. In sum, there are countless perspectives one can judge this film from, occasionally conflicting with one another due to their opposing scopes. Anyways, I can't place my eye on the exact reason, but actors were so much more capable of delivering with a charming character back in those days because the audience immediately recognizes the charisma of the film's protagonist as he daringly speaks out with clever, hilarious, and/or downright convincingly serious lines. His lovable personality is loud and clear with the story's development, and eventually, it's met with the beauty of Grace Kelly's character (Lisa). On a side note, as the intriguing plot progressed, the whole idea undoubtedly reminded me of Disturbia (2007). Moving on, albeit its heavily suspenseful and compelling nature, there were some faults I happened to identify. First of all, did the entire case really mean that much to Jeff to the point where he just couldn't bring himself to yell out when Lisa, his future wife, was endangered by Mr. Thorwald's intimidating and threatening presence? There was a sense of awkwardness in that I was viewing this curious fellow experiencing anxiety with visible sweat pouring down his face though he still continues to watch on as his love nears possible death. In addition, the result of this riveting mystery felt somewhat anticlimactic, and this slightly stemmed from the expectations one usually possesses upon viewing a Hitchcock film for there is usually a twist that shocks and awes the audience towards its end. We never got that from Rear Window as everything was exactly as it seemed. It could've been the main point of the feature, but still, I predicted the garden being the burial spot of the poor woman in the movie's first hour. And if the message of the film was that everything is truly as it seems, then why did another theme intrude the ending where you see a short, fat lover show up at the breathlessly gorgeous model's apartment? There and then, it seemed as if not everything is what it seems; so, already you have two contradictory (possible) themes on your plate. Which one was Hitchcock's actual intention? After all is said and done, Rear Window is a fantastic thriller with a not-as-satisfying end result, but it definitely impressed me the way most Hitchcock films have already. (North by Northwest is definitely next on my list.)

    This movie is on everyone's Top-Something list. Rightfully so. It is amazing that 99% of the movie is told from the single room. Hitchcock is at his best. He manages to keep the viewer is on the edge of his/her respective seat throughout the whole movie. He keeps the viewer in suspense through the whole thing. It is a very unique quality from a director who can keep one engaged and unless it's pointed out, you don't even realize that you haven't really changed scenes. Hitchcock is pure genius in this film. This is a film that even though I have seen it many times, somehow it always catches me. Now I make sure that I see this movie once a year. This is true cinema magic.

    Starting off with the pleasantries, the plot dives into something deeper. And that thing is the suspense in the first half. In the second half, however, the suspense is something else. It is the job & fun of the viewers to find it out. James Stewart is amazing, but the antagonist in here is adorable & in the limelight. Performances are immense & I am in love with the dialogs, especially those delivered by Stewart's smart alecky finesse. Music is fine, so is the direction. Cinematography is exceptional as is usual in a Hitchcock movie. I cannot end this without mentioning that apart from crime & investigation & spying, large part of it deals with relationships, slapstick & heavy sarcasm which is, of course, a treat for eyes & ears. Being not an original work, I rate it a huge 8.6 out of 10 for the maximum entertainment. Although, I cannot dub this as the makers' best. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended. A wonderful suspense thriller with humor. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Violence/Gore: Implied; Mild visuals | Sex/Nudity: Implied; No visuals | Smoking/Drugs: Very Mild | Alcohol: Mediocre | Mouth-Kiss: Mediocre | Nudity: Mild

    "Rear Window" is an another Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. This movie has to do with a photographer who spies his neighbors only from his apartment and he is convinced that one of them has committed a murder. James Stewart plays as L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies a photographer of a newspaper and the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont who is a high society fashion consultant and his girlfriend. I like more this old version than the new one with Christopher Reeve and Daryl Hannah. I can not compare these two because the differences between these two films are many and the time difference (44 years) are too much, but I stay in my opinion that the old version is better than the new one.

    Action photographer and journalist,"Jeff" (played by Jimmy Stewart) is wheel chair bound with a broken leg. His only activities during his convalescence are visits from the insurance nurse (played by and watching his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. He has visits from his glamorous model and dress designer girlfriend, Lisa (played by Grace Kelly) while he plays peeping Tom on his neighbors. Jeff watches his neighbors daily, even naming them (ex. Miss Torso, a dancer; Miss Lonely Heart, has dinner parties with imaginary friends; and the music man). From the opening scenes of Rear Window, the transitions and pace of the film are apparent. Immediately, we know what the main character does and how he became wheel chair bound. The film flows from the image of a thermometer to Jeff; his broken leg and wheel chair. The scene smoothly transitions to the broken camera and crash pictures on his wall and lastly a negative film image of a woman. This scene and several others are shot without spoken word. It is the transition of the images that speaks to the viewer and creates the suspense of what may or may not happen. The timing and transition of each piece of film tells the back story so we have information about Jeff and why he is viewing his word through the rear window of his apartment building. In 1 hour and 55 minutes, you are taken on a suspenseful ride of psychological terror. The movie follows an indirect subjective point of view, as we are drawn into the action. The director, Alfred Hitchcock, has once again pulled the viewer into his world of voyeurism and suspense. This movie is in his typical style where the blonde is elevated to a status and the male role either feels he is not good enough as in Jeff in Rear Window, or obsessed with her like the character Norman Bates. As in both movies the female lead is in jeopardy creating a back story to the suspense.

    Rear window is a great film. It couldn't have been any better. Direction is absolutely top notch, characters so strong, wonderfully scripted. Great acting, attention to details is of highest standard. I loved the role of Grace Kelly in the film. not only she's the most beautiful actress I've ever seen, but I was so impressed about her real life and depressed by her fate. Cant't wait to grab the new Nicole Kidman movie based on her life, Grace of Monaco. This is the best Hitchcock film I've seen yet, and I would certainly recommend it to all. Why 8stars then? just a comparative rating with all the movies I've seen. 1950s was surely the best decade of Hollywood in my opinion.

    Considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, 'Rear Window' follows the life L. B. Jeffries, portrayed brilliantly by James Stewart as a man trapped inside his own apartment following a leg injury. Temporarily in a wheelchair, the frustrated photographer spends his days staring outside of his rear window, observing the events of those around him, finding himself the witness of what he believes to be a murder. Grace Kelly plays the part of Jeffries' partner, Lisa Fremont as Hitchcock introduces us initially to the lives of the film's main characters for which we spend the majority of the first part of the film getting to know. It's through an incredibly detailed set, natural sound and great, natural shots that the viewer becomes involved in the film. Disabled, unable to move and only being able to see, from a distance, the actions of his neighbours, Jeffries' feels trapped and frustrated and his emotions can be felt in the way the film is displayed. Hitchcock, known as the master of suspense certainly lives up to this title in the film. Throughout we see the characters left in worrying and potentially dangerous situations, the viewer feels exactly like Jeffries on looking from a distance at situations developing beyond any type of control, wanting to intervene but ultimately being prevented to do so, frustratingly. The set and camera-work is utilised to the best it can be by Hitchcock who uses Jeffries' position 'spying' on others to explore a number of interesting sub-plots such as Miss Lonelyhearts lonely life, in one great scene she is scene acting out a dinner with herself, raising a glass to herself, an action mirrored by Jeffries who is watching. 'Rear Window' combines a mysterious thriller with romance, with a slight humorous and ironic feel as well. But the film is far from being violent; it's not a film in which the crime is a spectacle for the viewer but instead one that crime creates an eerie and worrying atmosphere through the mysterious and unknown possibilities. Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald gives a chilling performance, he is not needed to display himself emotionally for the majority which only builds up our expectations of the mysterious character before the film's final scenes occur, and the truth is revealed. Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is a great film and an extremely entertaining one to watch for so many reasons with great acting, brilliantly efficient use of a seemingly limiting set/location through excellent camera work and shots which help generate a mysterious and worrying atmosphere, creating suspense that builds up for the film's final scenes.

    The first film I saw by the British director. And it's a gruesomely dramatic Hitchcock movie. James Stewart (1908-1997) plays a photographer who has broken his leg. From his New York apartment he scouts the neighbors and believes himself to be a witness to a murder. Two female friends - played by Grace Kelly (1928-1982) and Thelma Ritter (1905-1969) - helps him solve the case. The film received four Oscar nominations, including best screenplay and directing, but did not win in any of the classes. Still counted as one of the director's best films. When it was filmed, it was filmed entirely indoors at Paramount Studios, this was the largest studio building ever in Hollywood. Cult Fact: This was the only film where Grace Kelly was smoking a cigarette. She refused to do it on any other film.

    Alfred Hitchcock was a master director, and Rear Window is a fine example of his extreme cleverness and subtlety. It's strange reviewing this film first after all of the Star Wars films, because they're complete polar opposites. Rear Window is a prime example of Hitchcock's genius, since, apart from one or two shots, the entire film is shot from James Stewart's apartment. This means that all action in the film, whether of Stewart and Kelly inside or the inhabitants of other apartments, is seen from the point of view of Stewart's character. This completely changes the way that we might view the film, since you're seeing it in the same way as Stewart  as a voyeur, peeking into the private lives of the other people on the block. It's extremely effective, and adds to the suspense of the film greatly. The story itself is both interesting and clever, with the main character trying to convince others that he has witnessed a murder, and attempting to find proof in what he sees whilst spying on his neighbours. Hitchcock introduces a large number of characters who we never properly meet, yet we feel that we know them very well. For example, "Miss Lonelyheart" is a character who at one point is about to commit suicide, and Hitchcock provides us with a good background to her story, as well as a fitting conclusion to it. The clearest evidence as to how much we have been spying on these people is their changes at the end of the film. We can clearly see how each group, whether it is the married couple, the songwriter or the dancer, has continued living and changed in the process. The murder case itself is very cleverly laid out, as is Stewart's logic throughout. Hitchcock knows exactly where to point the camera, constantly hinting to things which are later figured out. I was very proud that I figured out what the dog was doing far before any of the characters, since Hitchcock seemed to show him to us too frequently for his actions to be ordinary. The final battle is a bit over the top, but I thought Stewart's use of flash bulbs was a clever defence technique. However the build up to Mr. Thorwald entering his apartment is very tense and a tiny bit scary. On the whole this is an intelligent crime thriller, with a great insight into humanity's "spying and gossip" nature.

    this is my personal favorite Alfred Hitchcock film it is simply a masterpiece but there aren't any real twists at the end about the murders but it doesn't need any because the plot just strings you along the audience is the puppet and the director was the puppeteer if there is a top ten list for Hitchcock this movie is on the list it is just incredible the cast is great even the lonely Ms. Lonely hearts who is just in the background but she is great the neighbors are great the plot is great the characters are great everything is great about this movieand if you want to have a good edge of your seat thriller watch this film now

'Rear Window' combines a mysterious thriller with romance, with a slight humorous and ironic feel as well. But the film is far from being violent; it's not a film in which the crime is a spectacle for the viewer but instead one that crime creates an eerie and worrying atmosphere through the mysterious and unknown possibilities. Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald gives a chilling performance, he is not needed to display himself emotionally for the majority which only builds up our expectations of the mysterious character before the film's final scenes occur, and the truth is revealed. Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is a great film and an extremely entertaining one to watch for so many reasons with great acting, brilliantly efficient use of a seemingly limiting set/location through excellent camera work and shots which help generate a mysterious and worrying atmosphere, creating suspense that builds up for the film's final scenes.

    The first film I saw by the British director. And it's a gruesomely dramatic Hitchcock movie. James Stewart (1908-1997) plays a photographer who has broken his leg. From his New York apartment he scouts the neighbors and believes himself to be a witness to a murder. Two female friends - played by Grace Kelly (1928-1982) and Thelma Ritter (1905-1969) - helps him solve the case. The film received four Oscar nominations, including best screenplay and directing, but did not win in any of the classes. Still counted as one of the director's best films. When it was filmed, it was filmed entirely indoors at Paramount Studios, this was the largest studio building ever in Hollywood. Cult Fact: This was the only film where Grace Kelly was smoking a cigarette. She refused to do it on any other film.

    Alfred Hitchcock was a master director, and Rear Window is a fine example of his extreme cleverness and subtlety. It's strange reviewing this film first after all of the Star Wars films, because they're complete polar opposites. Rear Window is a prime example of Hitchcock's genius, since, apart from one or two shots, the entire film is shot from James Stewart's apartment. This means that all action in the film, whether of Stewart and Kelly inside or the inhabitants of other apartments, is seen from the point of view of Stewart's character. This completely changes the way that we might view the film, since you're seeing it in the same way as Stewart  as a voyeur, peeking into the private lives of the other people on the block. It's extremely effective, and adds to the suspense of the film greatly. The story itself is both interesting and clever, with the main character trying to convince others that he has witnessed a murder, and attempting to find proof in what he sees whilst spying on his neighbours. Hitchcock introduces a large number of characters who we never properly meet, yet we feel that we know them very well. For example, "Miss Lonelyheart" is a character who at one point is about to commit suicide, and Hitchcock provides us with a good background to her story, as well as a fitting conclusion to it. The clearest evidence as to how much we have been spying on these people is their changes at the end of the film. We can clearly see how each group, whether it is the married couple, the songwriter or the dancer, has continued living and changed in the process. The murder case itself is very cleverly laid out, as is Stewart's logic throughout. Hitchcock knows exactly where to point the camera, constantly hinting to things which are later figured out. I was very proud that I figured out what the dog was doing far before any of the characters, since Hitchcock seemed to show him to us too frequently for his actions to be ordinary. The final battle is a bit over the top, but I thought Stewart's use of flash bulbs was a clever defence technique. However the build up to Mr. Thorwald entering his apartment is very tense and a tiny bit scary. On the whole this is an intelligent crime thriller, with a great insight into humanity's "spying and gossip" nature.

    Hitchcock was a master of his craft- everyone is aware of that- and his ideas revolutionized and popularized the thriller genre, one of my personal favorites. Skimming through his rich filmography, every addition is fueled by unmatched suspense. This is no different with one of Hitchcock's highly-acclaimed classics, Read Window. The film promises so much potential with its opening act in which the camera is technically the first participant and onlooker as it manages to give us a considerable amount of backstory without any verbal language in its first five minutes or so. It carefully observes a fascinating environment/setting- one in which every neighbor's life is visible through their open windows. The way the set was built and is in appearance is simply genius and (almost) never was the set of a film as crucial to its story and themes as it is here. Right from the get-go, you witness an underlying theme in that this picture conveys the isolated and individualistic nature of neighborhoods in our current world. No one seems to be interested in their neighbors besides Jeff (and he even mentions this in one of his clever lines) so much so that they aren't even concerned about what they're actually partaking in those rooms of theirs; the neighbors are never aware anyways. However, on the opposite side, it can be argued that people in current society are frankly too obsessed with another's conversation or activities. Apparently, we stick our noses in everyone's business, and it can be argued on a political scale as well. We do, in fact, watch our foreign neighbors far too closely with invasive binoculars, and in this manner, Jeff could actually be perceived as the villain of Rear Window in a way. In sum, there are countless perspectives one can judge this film from, occasionally conflicting with one another due to their opposing scopes. Anyways, I can't place my eye on the exact reason, but actors were so much more capable of delivering with a charming character back in those days because the audience immediately recognizes the charisma of the film's protagonist as he daringly speaks out with clever, hilarious, and/or downright convincingly serious lines. His lovable personality is loud and clear with the story's development, and eventually, it's met with the beauty of Grace Kelly's character (Lisa). On a side note, as the intriguing plot progressed, the whole idea undoubtedly reminded me of Disturbia (2007). Moving on, albeit its heavily suspenseful and compelling nature, there were some faults I happened to identify. First of all, did the entire case really mean that much to Jeff to the point where he just couldn't bring himself to yell out when Lisa, his future wife, was endangered by Mr. Thorwald's intimidating and threatening presence? There was a sense of awkwardness in that I was viewing this curious fellow experiencing anxiety with visible sweat pouring down his face though he still continues to watch on as his love nears possible death. In addition, the result of this riveting mystery felt somewhat anticlimactic, and this slightly stemmed from the expectations one usually possesses upon viewing a Hitchcock film for there is usually a twist that shocks and awes the audience towards its end. We never got that from Rear Window as everything was exactly as it seemed. It could've been the main point of the feature, but still, I predicted the garden being the burial spot of the poor woman in the movie's first hour. And if the message of the film was that everything is truly as it seems, then why did another theme intrude the ending where you see a short, fat lover show up at the breathlessly gorgeous model's apartment? There and then, it seemed as if not everything is what it seems; so, already you have two contradictory (possible) themes on your plate. Which one was Hitchcock's actual intention? After all is said and done, Rear Window is a fantastic thriller with a not-as-satisfying end result, but it definitely impressed me the way most Hitchcock films have already. (North by Northwest is definitely next on my list.)

    This movie is on everyone's Top-Something list. Rightfully so. It is amazing that 99% of the movie is told from the single room. Hitchcock is at his best. He manages to keep the viewer is on the edge of his/her respective seat throughout the whole movie. He keeps the viewer in suspense through the whole thing. It is a very unique quality from a director who can keep one engaged and unless it's pointed out, you don't even realize that you haven't really changed scenes. Hitchcock is pure genius in this film. This is a film that even though I have seen it many times, somehow it always catches me. Now I make sure that I see this movie once a year. This is true cinema magic.

    Starting off with the pleasantries, the plot dives into something deeper. And that thing is the suspense in the first half. In the second half, however, the suspense is something else. It is the job & fun of the viewers to find it out. James Stewart is amazing, but the antagonist in here is adorable & in the limelight. Performances are immense & I am in love with the dialogs, especially those delivered by Stewart's smart alecky finesse. Music is fine, so is the direction. Cinematography is exceptional as is usual in a Hitchcock movie. I cannot end this without mentioning that apart from crime & investigation & spying, large part of it deals with relationships, slapstick & heavy sarcasm which is, of course, a treat for eyes & ears. Being not an original work, I rate it a huge 8.6 out of 10 for the maximum entertainment. Although, I cannot dub this as the makers' best. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended. A wonderful suspense thriller with humor. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Violence/Gore: Implied; Mild visuals | Sex/Nudity: Implied; No visuals | Smoking/Drugs: Very Mild | Alcohol: Mediocre | Mouth-Kiss: Mediocre | Nudity: Mild

    "Rear Window" is an another Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. This movie has to do with a photographer who spies his neighbors only from his apartment and he is convinced that one of them has committed a murder. James Stewart plays as L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies a photographer of a newspaper and the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont who is a high society fashion consultant and his girlfriend. I like more this old version than the new one with Christopher Reeve and Daryl Hannah. I can not compare these two because the differences between these two films are many and the time difference (44 years) are too much, but I stay in my opinion that the old version is better than the new one.

    Action photographer and journalist,"Jeff" (played by Jimmy Stewart) is wheel chair bound with a broken leg. His only activities during his convalescence are visits from the insurance nurse (played by and watching his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. He has visits from his glamorous model and dress designer girlfriend, Lisa (played by Grace Kelly) while he plays peeping Tom on his neighbors. Jeff watches his neighbors daily, even naming them (ex. Miss Torso, a dancer; Miss Lonely Heart, has dinner parties with imaginary friends; and the music man). From the opening scenes of Rear Window, the transitions and pace of the film are apparent. Immediately, we know what the main character does and how he became wheel chair bound. The film flows from the image of a thermometer to Jeff; his broken leg and wheel chair. The scene smoothly transitions to the broken camera and crash pictures on his wall and lastly a negative film image of a woman. This scene and several others are shot without spoken word. It is the transition of the images that speaks to the viewer and creates the suspense of what may or may not happen. The timing and transition of each piece of film tells the back story so we have information about Jeff and why he is viewing his word through the rear window of his apartment building. In 1 hour and 55 minutes, you are taken on a suspenseful ride of psychological terror. The movie follows an indirect subjective point of view, as we are drawn into the action. The director, Alfred Hitchcock, has once again pulled the viewer into his world of voyeurism and suspense. This movie is in his typical style where the blonde is elevated to a status and the male role either feels he is not good enough as in Jeff in Rear Window, or obsessed with her like the character Norman Bates. As in both movies the female lead is in jeopardy creating a back story to the suspense.

    Rear window is a great film. It couldn't have been any better. Direction is absolutely top notch, characters so strong, wonderfully scripted. Great acting, attention to details is of highest standard. I loved the role of Grace Kelly in the film. not only she's the most beautiful actress I've ever seen, but I was so impressed about her real life and depressed by her fate. Cant't wait to grab the new Nicole Kidman movie based on her life, Grace of Monaco. This is the best Hitchcock film I've seen yet, and I would certainly recommend it to all. Why 8stars then? just a comparative rating with all the movies I've seen. 1950s was surely the best decade of Hollywood in my opinion.

    Considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, 'Rear Window' follows the life L. B. Jeffries, portrayed brilliantly by James Stewart as a man trapped inside his own apartment following a leg injury. Temporarily in a wheelchair, the frustrated photographer spends his days staring outside of his rear window, observing the events of those around him, finding himself the witness of what he believes to be a murder. Grace Kelly plays the part of Jeffries' partner, Lisa Fremont as Hitchcock introduces us initially to the lives of the film's main characters for which we spend the majority of the first part of the film getting to know. It's through an incredibly detailed set, natural sound and great, natural shots that the viewer becomes involved in the film. Disabled, unable to move and only being able to see, from a distance, the actions of his neighbours, Jeffries' feels trapped and frustrated and his emotions can be felt in the way the film is displayed. Hitchcock, known as the master of suspense certainly lives up to this title in the film. Throughout we see the characters left in worrying and potentially dangerous situations, the viewer feels exactly like Jeffries on looking from a distance at situations developing beyond any type of control, wanting to intervene but ultimately being prevented to do so, frustratingly. The set and camera-work is utilised to the best it can be by Hitchcock who uses Jeffries' position 'spying' on others to explore a number of interesting sub-plots such as Miss Lonelyhearts lonely life, in one great scene she is scene acting out a dinner with herself, raising a glass to herself, an action mirrored by Jeffries who is watching. 'Rear Window' combines a mysterious thriller with romance, with a slight humorous and ironic feel as well. But the film is far from being violent; it's not a film in which the crime is a spectacle for the viewer but instead one that crime creates an eerie and worrying atmosphere through the mysterious and unknown possibilities. Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald gives a chilling performance, he is not needed to display himself emotionally for the majority which only builds up our expectations of the mysterious character before the film's final scenes occur, and the truth is revealed. Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is a great film and an extremely entertaining one to watch for so many reasons with great acting, brilliantly efficient use of a seemingly limiting set/location through excellent camera work and shots which help generate a mysterious and worrying atmosphere, creating suspense that builds up for the film's final scenes.

His only activities during his convalescence are visits from the insurance nurse (played by and watching his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment.

Immediately, we know what the main character does and how he became wheel chair bound. The film flows from the image of a thermometer to Jeff; his broken leg and wheel chair. The scene smoothly transitions to the broken camera and crash pictures on his wall and lastly a negative film image of a woman. This scene and several others are shot without spoken word. It is the transition of the images that speaks to the viewer and creates the suspense of what may or may not happen. The timing and transition of each piece of film tells the back story so we have information about Jeff and why he is viewing his word through the rear window of his apartment building. In 1 hour and 55 minutes, you are taken on a suspenseful ride of psychological terror. The movie follows an indirect subjective point of view, as we are drawn into the action. The director, Alfred Hitchcock, has once again pulled the viewer into his world of voyeurism and suspense. This movie is in his typical style where the blonde is elevated to a status and the male role either feels he is not good enough as in Jeff in Rear Window, or obsessed with her like the character Norman Bates. As in both movies the female lead is in jeopardy creating a back story to the suspense.

    Rear window is a great film. It couldn't have been any better. Direction is absolutely top notch, characters so strong, wonderfully scripted. Great acting, attention to details is of highest standard. I loved the role of Grace Kelly in the film. not only she's the most beautiful actress I've ever seen, but I was so impressed about her real life and depressed by her fate. Cant't wait to grab the new Nicole Kidman movie based on her life, Grace of Monaco. This is the best Hitchcock film I've seen yet, and I would certainly recommend it to all. Why 8stars then? just a comparative rating with all the movies I've seen. 1950s was surely the best decade of Hollywood in my opinion.

    Considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, 'Rear Window' follows the life L. B. Jeffries, portrayed brilliantly by James Stewart as a man trapped inside his own apartment following a leg injury. Temporarily in a wheelchair, the frustrated photographer spends his days staring outside of his rear window, observing the events of those around him, finding himself the witness of what he believes to be a murder. Grace Kelly plays the part of Jeffries' partner, Lisa Fremont as Hitchcock introduces us initially to the lives of the film's main characters for which we spend the majority of the first part of the film getting to know. It's through an incredibly detailed set, natural sound and great, natural shots that the viewer becomes involved in the film. Disabled, unable to move and only being able to see, from a distance, the actions of his neighbours, Jeffries' feels trapped and frustrated and his emotions can be felt in the way the film is displayed. Hitchcock, known as the master of suspense certainly lives up to this title in the film. Throughout we see the characters left in worrying and potentially dangerous situations, the viewer feels exactly like Jeffries on looking from a distance at situations developing beyond any type of control, wanting to intervene but ultimately being prevented to do so, frustratingly. The set and camera-work is utilised to the best it can be by Hitchcock who uses Jeffries' position 'spying' on others to explore a number of interesting sub-plots such as Miss Lonelyhearts lonely life, in one great scene she is scene acting out a dinner with herself, raising a glass to herself, an action mirrored by Jeffries who is watching. 'Rear Window' combines a mysterious thriller with romance, with a slight humorous and ironic feel as well. But the film is far from being violent; it's not a film in which the crime is a spectacle for the viewer but instead one that crime creates an eerie and worrying atmosphere through the mysterious and unknown possibilities. Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald gives a chilling performance, he is not needed to display himself emotionally for the majority which only builds up our expectations of the mysterious character before the film's final scenes occur, and the truth is revealed. Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is a great film and an extremely entertaining one to watch for so many reasons with great acting, brilliantly efficient use of a seemingly limiting set/location through excellent camera work and shots which help generate a mysterious and worrying atmosphere, creating suspense that builds up for the film's final scenes.

    The first film I saw by the British director. And it's a gruesomely dramatic Hitchcock movie. James Stewart (1908-1997) plays a photographer who has broken his leg. From his New York apartment he scouts the neighbors and believes himself to be a witness to a murder. Two female friends - played by Grace Kelly (1928-1982) and Thelma Ritter (1905-1969) - helps him solve the case. The film received four Oscar nominations, including best screenplay and directing, but did not win in any of the classes. Still counted as one of the director's best films. When it was filmed, it was filmed entirely indoors at Paramount Studios, this was the largest studio building ever in Hollywood. Cult Fact: This was the only film where Grace Kelly was smoking a cigarette. She refused to do it on any other film.

    Alfred Hitchcock was a master director, and Rear Window is a fine example of his extreme cleverness and subtlety. It's strange reviewing this film first after all of the Star Wars films, because they're complete polar opposites. Rear Window is a prime example of Hitchcock's genius, since, apart from one or two shots, the entire film is shot from James Stewart's apartment. This means that all action in the film, whether of Stewart and Kelly inside or the inhabitants of other apartments, is seen from the point of view of Stewart's character. This completely changes the way that we might view the film, since you're seeing it in the same way as Stewart  as a voyeur, peeking into the private lives of the other people on the block. It's extremely effective, and adds to the suspense of the film greatly. The story itself is both interesting and clever, with the main character trying to convince others that he has witnessed a murder, and attempting to find proof in what he sees whilst spying on his neighbours. Hitchcock introduces a large number of characters who we never properly meet, yet we feel that we know them very well. For example, "Miss Lonelyheart" is a character who at one point is about to commit suicide, and Hitchcock provides us with a good background to her story, as well as a fitting conclusion to it. The clearest evidence as to how much we have been spying on these people is their changes at the end of the film. We can clearly see how each group, whether it is the married couple, the songwriter or the dancer, has continued living and changed in the process. The murder case itself is very cleverly laid out, as is Stewart's logic throughout. Hitchcock knows exactly where to point the camera, constantly hinting to things which are later figured out. I was very proud that I figured out what the dog was doing far before any of the characters, since Hitchcock seemed to show him to us too frequently for his actions to be ordinary. The final battle is a bit over the top, but I thought Stewart's use of flash bulbs was a clever defence technique. However the build up to Mr. Thorwald entering his apartment is very tense and a tiny bit scary. On the whole this is an intelligent crime thriller, with a great insight into humanity's "spying and gossip" nature.

    Hitchcock was a master of his craft- everyone is aware of that- and his ideas revolutionized and popularized the thriller genre, one of my personal favorites. Skimming through his rich filmography, every addition is fueled by unmatched suspense. This is no different with one of Hitchcock's highly-acclaimed classics, Read Window. The film promises so much potential with its opening act in which the camera is technically the first participant and onlooker as it manages to give us a considerable amount of backstory without any verbal language in its first five minutes or so. It carefully observes a fascinating environment/setting- one in which every neighbor's life is visible through their open windows. The way the set was built and is in appearance is simply genius and (almost) never was the set of a film as crucial to its story and themes as it is here. Right from the get-go, you witness an underlying theme in that this picture conveys the isolated and individualistic nature of neighborhoods in our current world. No one seems to be interested in their neighbors besides Jeff (and he even mentions this in one of his clever lines) so much so that they aren't even concerned about what they're actually partaking in those rooms of theirs; the neighbors are never aware anyways. However, on the opposite side, it can be argued that people in current society are frankly too obsessed with another's conversation or activities. Apparently, we stick our noses in everyone's business, and it can be argued on a political scale as well. We do, in fact, watch our foreign neighbors far too closely with invasive binoculars, and in this manner, Jeff could actually be perceived as the villain of Rear Window in a way. In sum, there are countless perspectives one can judge this film from, occasionally conflicting with one another due to their opposing scopes. Anyways, I can't place my eye on the exact reason, but actors were so much more capable of delivering with a charming character back in those days because the audience immediately recognizes the charisma of the film's protagonist as he daringly speaks out with clever, hilarious, and/or downright convincingly serious lines. His lovable personality is loud and clear with the story's development, and eventually, it's met with the beauty of Grace Kelly's character (Lisa). On a side note, as the intriguing plot progressed, the whole idea undoubtedly reminded me of Disturbia (2007). Moving on, albeit its heavily suspenseful and compelling nature, there were some faults I happened to identify. First of all, did the entire case really mean that much to Jeff to the point where he just couldn't bring himself to yell out when Lisa, his future wife, was endangered by Mr. Thorwald's intimidating and threatening presence? There was a sense of awkwardness in that I was viewing this curious fellow experiencing anxiety with visible sweat pouring down his face though he still continues to watch on as his love nears possible death. In addition, the result of this riveting mystery felt somewhat anticlimactic, and this slightly stemmed from the expectations one usually possesses upon viewing a Hitchcock film for there is usually a twist that shocks and awes the audience towards its end. We never got that from Rear Window as everything was exactly as it seemed. It could've been the main point of the feature, but still, I predicted the garden being the burial spot of the poor woman in the movie's first hour. And if the message of the film was that everything is truly as it seems, then why did another theme intrude the ending where you see a short, fat lover show up at the breathlessly gorgeous model's apartment? There and then, it seemed as if not everything is what it seems; so, already you have two contradictory (possible) themes on your plate. Which one was Hitchcock's actual intention? After all is said and done, Rear Window is a fantastic thriller with a not-as-satisfying end result, but it definitely impressed me the way most Hitchcock films have already. (North by Northwest is definitely next on my list.)

    This movie is on everyone's Top-Something list. Rightfully so. It is amazing that 99% of the movie is told from the single room. Hitchcock is at his best. He manages to keep the viewer is on the edge of his/her respective seat throughout the whole movie. He keeps the viewer in suspense through the whole thing. It is a very unique quality from a director who can keep one engaged and unless it's pointed out, you don't even realize that you haven't really changed scenes. Hitchcock is pure genius in this film. This is a film that even though I have seen it many times, somehow it always catches me. Now I make sure that I see this movie once a year. This is true cinema magic.

    Starting off with the pleasantries, the plot dives into something deeper. And that thing is the suspense in the first half. In the second half, however, the suspense is something else. It is the job & fun of the viewers to find it out. James Stewart is amazing, but the antagonist in here is adorable & in the limelight. Performances are immense & I am in love with the dialogs, especially those delivered by Stewart's smart alecky finesse. Music is fine, so is the direction. Cinematography is exceptional as is usual in a Hitchcock movie. I cannot end this without mentioning that apart from crime & investigation & spying, large part of it deals with relationships, slapstick & heavy sarcasm which is, of course, a treat for eyes & ears. Being not an original work, I rate it a huge 8.6 out of 10 for the maximum entertainment. Although, I cannot dub this as the makers' best. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended. A wonderful suspense thriller with humor. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Violence/Gore: Implied; Mild visuals | Sex/Nudity: Implied; No visuals | Smoking/Drugs: Very Mild | Alcohol: Mediocre | Mouth-Kiss: Mediocre | Nudity: Mild

    "Rear Window" is an another Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. This movie has to do with a photographer who spies his neighbors only from his apartment and he is convinced that one of them has committed a murder. James Stewart plays as L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies a photographer of a newspaper and the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont who is a high society fashion consultant and his girlfriend. I like more this old version than the new one with Christopher Reeve and Daryl Hannah. I can not compare these two because the differences between these two films are many and the time difference (44 years) are too much, but I stay in my opinion that the old version is better than the new one.

    Action photographer and journalist,"Jeff" (played by Jimmy Stewart) is wheel chair bound with a broken leg. His only activities during his convalescence are visits from the insurance nurse (played by and watching his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. He has visits from his glamorous model and dress designer girlfriend, Lisa (played by Grace Kelly) while he plays peeping Tom on his neighbors. Jeff watches his neighbors daily, even naming them (ex. Miss Torso, a dancer; Miss Lonely Heart, has dinner parties with imaginary friends; and the music man). From the opening scenes of Rear Window, the transitions and pace of the film are apparent. Immediately, we know what the main character does and how he became wheel chair bound. The film flows from the image of a thermometer to Jeff; his broken leg and wheel chair. The scene smoothly transitions to the broken camera and crash pictures on his wall and lastly a negative film image of a woman. This scene and several others are shot without spoken word. It is the transition of the images that speaks to the viewer and creates the suspense of what may or may not happen. The timing and transition of each piece of film tells the back story so we have information about Jeff and why he is viewing his word through the rear window of his apartment building.

This movie is in his typical style where the blonde is elevated to a status and the male role either feels he is not good enough as in Jeff in Rear Window, or obsessed with her like the character Norman Bates. As in both movies the female lead is in jeopardy creating a back story to the suspense.

    Starting off with the pleasantries, the plot dives into something deeper. And that thing is the suspense in the first half. In the second half, however, the suspense is something else. It is the job & fun of the viewers to find it out. James Stewart is amazing, but the antagonist in here is adorable & in the limelight. Performances are immense & I am in love with the dialogs, especially those delivered by Stewart's smart alecky finesse. Music is fine, so is the direction. Cinematography is exceptional as is usual in a Hitchcock movie. I cannot end this without mentioning that apart from crime & investigation & spying, large part of it deals with relationships, slapstick & heavy sarcasm which is, of course, a treat for eyes & ears. Being not an original work, I rate it a huge 8.6 out of 10 for the maximum entertainment. Although, I cannot dub this as the makers' best. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended. A wonderful suspense thriller with humor. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Violence/Gore: Implied; Mild visuals | Sex/Nudity: Implied; No visuals | Smoking/Drugs: Very Mild | Alcohol: Mediocre | Mouth-Kiss: Mediocre | Nudity: Mild

    "Rear Window" is an another Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. This movie has to do with a photographer who spies his neighbors only from his apartment and he is convinced that one of them has committed a murder. James Stewart plays as L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies a photographer of a newspaper and the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont who is a high society fashion consultant and his girlfriend. I like more this old version than the new one with Christopher Reeve and Daryl Hannah. I can not compare these two because the differences between these two films are many and the time difference (44 years) are too much, but I stay in my opinion that the old version is better than the new one.

    Action photographer and journalist,"Jeff" (played by Jimmy Stewart) is wheel chair bound with a broken leg. His only activities during his convalescence are visits from the insurance nurse (played by and watching his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. He has visits from his glamorous model and dress designer girlfriend, Lisa (played by Grace Kelly) while he plays peeping Tom on his neighbors. Jeff watches his neighbors daily, even naming them (ex. Miss Torso, a dancer; Miss Lonely Heart, has dinner parties with imaginary friends; and the music man). From the opening scenes of Rear Window, the transitions and pace of the film are apparent. Immediately, we know what the main character does and how he became wheel chair bound. The film flows from the image of a thermometer to Jeff; his broken leg and wheel chair. The scene smoothly transitions to the broken camera and crash pictures on his wall and lastly a negative film image of a woman. This scene and several others are shot without spoken word. It is the transition of the images that speaks to the viewer and creates the suspense of what may or may not happen. The timing and transition of each piece of film tells the back story so we have information about Jeff and why he is viewing his word through the rear window of his apartment building. In 1 hour and 55 minutes, you are taken on a suspenseful ride of psychological terror. The movie follows an indirect subjective point of view, as we are drawn into the action. The director, Alfred Hitchcock, has once again pulled the viewer into his world of voyeurism and suspense. This movie is in his typical style where the blonde is elevated to a status and the male role either feels he is not good enough as in Jeff in Rear Window, or obsessed with her like the character Norman Bates. As in both movies the female lead is in jeopardy creating a back story to the suspense.

    Rear window is a great film. It couldn't have been any better. Direction is absolutely top notch, characters so strong, wonderfully scripted. Great acting, attention to details is of highest standard. I loved the role of Grace Kelly in the film. not only she's the most beautiful actress I've ever seen, but I was so impressed about her real life and depressed by her fate. Cant't wait to grab the new Nicole Kidman movie based on her life, Grace of Monaco. This is the best Hitchcock film I've seen yet, and I would certainly recommend it to all. Why 8stars then? just a comparative rating with all the movies I've seen. 1950s was surely the best decade of Hollywood in my opinion.

    Considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, 'Rear Window' follows the life L. B. Jeffries, portrayed brilliantly by James Stewart as a man trapped inside his own apartment following a leg injury. Temporarily in a wheelchair, the frustrated photographer spends his days staring outside of his rear window, observing the events of those around him, finding himself the witness of what he believes to be a murder. Grace Kelly plays the part of Jeffries' partner, Lisa Fremont as Hitchcock introduces us initially to the lives of the film's main characters for which we spend the majority of the first part of the film getting to know. It's through an incredibly detailed set, natural sound and great, natural shots that the viewer becomes involved in the film. Disabled, unable to move and only being able to see, from a distance, the actions of his neighbours, Jeffries' feels trapped and frustrated and his emotions can be felt in the way the film is displayed. Hitchcock, known as the master of suspense certainly lives up to this title in the film. Throughout we see the characters left in worrying and potentially dangerous situations, the viewer feels exactly like Jeffries on looking from a distance at situations developing beyond any type of control, wanting to intervene but ultimately being prevented to do so, frustratingly. The set and camera-work is utilised to the best it can be by Hitchcock who uses Jeffries' position 'spying' on others to explore a number of interesting sub-plots such as Miss Lonelyhearts lonely life, in one great scene she is scene acting out a dinner with herself, raising a glass to herself, an action mirrored by Jeffries who is watching. 'Rear Window' combines a mysterious thriller with romance, with a slight humorous and ironic feel as well. But the film is far from being violent; it's not a film in which the crime is a spectacle for the viewer but instead one that crime creates an eerie and worrying atmosphere through the mysterious and unknown possibilities. Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald gives a chilling performance, he is not needed to display himself emotionally for the majority which only builds up our expectations of the mysterious character before the film's final scenes occur, and the truth is revealed. Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is a great film and an extremely entertaining one to watch for so many reasons with great acting, brilliantly efficient use of a seemingly limiting set/location through excellent camera work and shots which help generate a mysterious and worrying atmosphere, creating suspense that builds up for the film's final scenes.

    The first film I saw by the British director. And it's a gruesomely dramatic Hitchcock movie. James Stewart (1908-1997) plays a photographer who has broken his leg. From his New York apartment he scouts the neighbors and believes himself to be a witness to a murder. Two female friends - played by Grace Kelly (1928-1982) and Thelma Ritter (1905-1969) - helps him solve the case. The film received four Oscar nominations, including best screenplay and directing, but did not win in any of the classes. Still counted as one of the director's best films. When it was filmed, it was filmed entirely indoors at Paramount Studios, this was the largest studio building ever in Hollywood. Cult Fact: This was the only film where Grace Kelly was smoking a cigarette. She refused to do it on any other film.

    Alfred Hitchcock was a master director, and Rear Window is a fine example of his extreme cleverness and subtlety. It's strange reviewing this film first after all of the Star Wars films, because they're complete polar opposites. Rear Window is a prime example of Hitchcock's genius, since, apart from one or two shots, the entire film is shot from James Stewart's apartment. This means that all action in the film, whether of Stewart and Kelly inside or the inhabitants of other apartments, is seen from the point of view of Stewart's character. This completely changes the way that we might view the film, since you're seeing it in the same way as Stewart  as a voyeur, peeking into the private lives of the other people on the block. It's extremely effective, and adds to the suspense of the film greatly. The story itself is both interesting and clever, with the main character trying to convince others that he has witnessed a murder, and attempting to find proof in what he sees whilst spying on his neighbours. Hitchcock introduces a large number of characters who we never properly meet, yet we feel that we know them very well. For example, "Miss Lonelyheart" is a character who at one point is about to commit suicide, and Hitchcock provides us with a good background to her story, as well as a fitting conclusion to it. The clearest evidence as to how much we have been spying on these people is their changes at the end of the film. We can clearly see how each group, whether it is the married couple, the songwriter or the dancer, has continued living and changed in the process. The murder case itself is very cleverly laid out, as is Stewart's logic throughout. Hitchcock knows exactly where to point the camera, constantly hinting to things which are later figured out. I was very proud that I figured out what the dog was doing far before any of the characters, since Hitchcock seemed to show him to us too frequently for his actions to be ordinary. The final battle is a bit over the top, but I thought Stewart's use of flash bulbs was a clever defence technique. However the build up to Mr. Thorwald entering his apartment is very tense and a tiny bit scary. On the whole this is an intelligent crime thriller, with a great insight into humanity's "spying and gossip" nature.

    Hitchcock was a master of his craft- everyone is aware of that- and his ideas revolutionized and popularized the thriller genre, one of my personal favorites. Skimming through his rich filmography, every addition is fueled by unmatched suspense. This is no different with one of Hitchcock's highly-acclaimed classics, Read Window. The film promises so much potential with its opening act in which the camera is technically the first participant and onlooker as it manages to give us a considerable amount of backstory without any verbal language in its first five minutes or so. It carefully observes a fascinating environment/setting- one in which every neighbor's life is visible through their open windows. The way the set was built and is in appearance is simply genius and (almost) never was the set of a film as crucial to its story and themes as it is here. Right from the get-go, you witness an underlying theme in that this picture conveys the isolated and individualistic nature of neighborhoods in our current world. No one seems to be interested in their neighbors besides Jeff (and he even mentions this in one of his clever lines) so much so that they aren't even concerned about what they're actually partaking in those rooms of theirs; the neighbors are never aware anyways. However, on the opposite side, it can be argued that people in current society are frankly too obsessed with another's conversation or activities. Apparently, we stick our noses in everyone's business, and it can be argued on a political scale as well. We do, in fact, watch our foreign neighbors far too closely with invasive binoculars, and in this manner, Jeff could actually be perceived as the villain of Rear Window in a way. In sum, there are countless perspectives one can judge this film from, occasionally conflicting with one another due to their opposing scopes. Anyways, I can't place my eye on the exact reason, but actors were so much more capable of delivering with a charming character back in those days because the audience immediately recognizes the charisma of the film's protagonist as he daringly speaks out with clever, hilarious, and/or downright convincingly serious lines. His lovable personality is loud and clear with the story's development, and eventually, it's met with the beauty of Grace Kelly's character (Lisa). On a side note, as the intriguing plot progressed, the whole idea undoubtedly reminded me of Disturbia (2007). Moving on, albeit its heavily suspenseful and compelling nature, there were some faults I happened to identify. First of all, did the entire case really mean that much to Jeff to the point where he just couldn't bring himself to yell out when Lisa, his future wife, was endangered by Mr. Thorwald's intimidating and threatening presence? There was a sense of awkwardness in that I was viewing this curious fellow experiencing anxiety with visible sweat pouring down his face though he still continues to watch on as his love nears possible death. In addition, the result of this riveting mystery felt somewhat anticlimactic, and this slightly stemmed from the expectations one usually possesses upon viewing a Hitchcock film for there is usually a twist that shocks and awes the audience towards its end. We never got that from Rear Window as everything was exactly as it seemed. It could've been the main point of the feature, but still, I predicted the garden being the burial spot of the poor woman in the movie's first hour. And if the message of the film was that everything is truly as it seems, then why did another theme intrude the ending where you see a short, fat lover show up at the breathlessly gorgeous model's apartment? There and then, it seemed as if not everything is what it seems; so, already you have two contradictory (possible) themes on your plate. Which one was Hitchcock's actual intention? After all is said and done, Rear Window is a fantastic thriller with a not-as-satisfying end result, but it definitely impressed me the way most Hitchcock films have already. (North by Northwest is definitely next on my list.)

    This movie is on everyone's Top-Something list. Rightfully so. It is amazing that 99% of the movie is told from the single room. Hitchcock is at his best. He manages to keep the viewer is on the edge of his/her respective seat throughout the whole movie. He keeps the viewer in suspense through the whole thing. It is a very unique quality from a director who can keep one engaged and unless it's pointed out, you don't even realize that you haven't really changed scenes. Hitchcock is pure genius in this film. This is a film that even though I have seen it many times, somehow it always catches me. Now I make sure that I see this movie once a year. This is true cinema magic.

We do, in fact, watch our foreign neighbors far too closely with invasive binoculars, and in this manner, Jeff could actually be perceived as the villain of Rear Window in a way. In sum, there are countless perspectives one can judge this film from, occasionally conflicting with one another due to their opposing scopes. Anyways, I can't place my eye on the exact reason, but actors were so much more capable of delivering with a charming character back in those days because the audience immediately recognizes the charisma of the film's protagonist as he daringly speaks out with clever, hilarious, and/or downright convincingly serious lines. His lovable personality is loud and clear with the story's development, and eventually, it's met with the beauty of Grace Kelly's character (Lisa). On a side note, as the intriguing plot progressed, the whole idea undoubtedly reminded me of Disturbia (2007). Moving on, albeit its heavily suspenseful and compelling nature, there were some faults I happened to identify. First of all, did the entire case really mean that much to Jeff to the point where he just couldn't bring himself to yell out when Lisa, his future wife, was endangered by Mr. Thorwald's intimidating and threatening presence? There was a sense of awkwardness in that I was viewing this curious fellow experiencing anxiety with visible sweat pouring down his face though he still continues to watch on as his love nears possible death. In addition, the result of this riveting mystery felt somewhat anticlimactic, and this slightly stemmed from the expectations one usually possesses upon viewing a Hitchcock film for there is usually a twist that shocks and awes the audience towards its end. We never got that from Rear Window as everything was exactly as it seemed. It could've been the main point of the feature, but still, I predicted the garden being the burial spot of the poor woman in the movie's first hour. And if the message of the film was that everything is truly as it seems, then why did another theme intrude the ending where you see a short, fat lover show up at the breathlessly gorgeous model's apartment? There and then, it seemed as if not everything is what it seems; so, already you have two contradictory (possible) themes on your plate. Which one was Hitchcock's actual intention? After all is said and done, Rear Window is a fantastic thriller with a not-as-satisfying end result, but it definitely impressed me the way most Hitchcock films have already. (North by Northwest is definitely next on my list.)

    This movie is on everyone's Top-Something list. Rightfully so. It is amazing that 99% of the movie is told from the single room. Hitchcock is at his best. He manages to keep the viewer is on the edge of his/her respective seat throughout the whole movie. He keeps the viewer in suspense through the whole thing. It is a very unique quality from a director who can keep one engaged and unless it's pointed out, you don't even realize that you haven't really changed scenes. Hitchcock is pure genius in this film. This is a film that even though I have seen it many times, somehow it always catches me. Now I make sure that I see this movie once a year. This is true cinema magic.

    Starting off with the pleasantries, the plot dives into something deeper. And that thing is the suspense in the first half. In the second half, however, the suspense is something else. It is the job & fun of the viewers to find it out. James Stewart is amazing, but the antagonist in here is adorable & in the limelight. Performances are immense & I am in love with the dialogs, especially those delivered by Stewart's smart alecky finesse. Music is fine, so is the direction. Cinematography is exceptional as is usual in a Hitchcock movie. I cannot end this without mentioning that apart from crime & investigation & spying, large part of it deals with relationships, slapstick & heavy sarcasm which is, of course, a treat for eyes & ears. Being not an original work, I rate it a huge 8.6 out of 10 for the maximum entertainment. Although, I cannot dub this as the makers' best. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended. A wonderful suspense thriller with humor. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Violence/Gore: Implied; Mild visuals | Sex/Nudity: Implied; No visuals | Smoking/Drugs: Very Mild | Alcohol: Mediocre | Mouth-Kiss: Mediocre | Nudity: Mild

    "Rear Window" is an another Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. This movie has to do with a photographer who spies his neighbors only from his apartment and he is convinced that one of them has committed a murder. James Stewart plays as L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies a photographer of a newspaper and the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont who is a high society fashion consultant and his girlfriend. I like more this old version than the new one with Christopher Reeve and Daryl Hannah. I can not compare these two because the differences between these two films are many and the time difference (44 years) are too much, but I stay in my opinion that the old version is better than the new one.

    Action photographer and journalist,"Jeff" (played by Jimmy Stewart) is wheel chair bound with a broken leg. His only activities during his convalescence are visits from the insurance nurse (played by and watching his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. He has visits from his glamorous model and dress designer girlfriend, Lisa (played by Grace Kelly) while he plays peeping Tom on his neighbors. Jeff watches his neighbors daily, even naming them (ex. Miss Torso, a dancer; Miss Lonely Heart, has dinner parties with imaginary friends; and the music man). From the opening scenes of Rear Window, the transitions and pace of the film are apparent. Immediately, we know what the main character does and how he became wheel chair bound. The film flows from the image of a thermometer to Jeff; his broken leg and wheel chair. The scene smoothly transitions to the broken camera and crash pictures on his wall and lastly a negative film image of a woman. This scene and several others are shot without spoken word. It is the transition of the images that speaks to the viewer and creates the suspense of what may or may not happen. The timing and transition of each piece of film tells the back story so we have information about Jeff and why he is viewing his word through the rear window of his apartment building. In 1 hour and 55 minutes, you are taken on a suspenseful ride of psychological terror. The movie follows an indirect subjective point of view, as we are drawn into the action. The director, Alfred Hitchcock, has once again pulled the viewer into his world of voyeurism and suspense. This movie is in his typical style where the blonde is elevated to a status and the male role either feels he is not good enough as in Jeff in Rear Window, or obsessed with her like the character Norman Bates. As in both movies the female lead is in jeopardy creating a back story to the suspense.

    Rear window is a great film. It couldn't have been any better. Direction is absolutely top notch, characters so strong, wonderfully scripted. Great acting, attention to details is of highest standard. I loved the role of Grace Kelly in the film. not only she's the most beautiful actress I've ever seen, but I was so impressed about her real life and depressed by her fate. Cant't wait to grab the new Nicole Kidman movie based on her life, Grace of Monaco. This is the best Hitchcock film I've seen yet, and I would certainly recommend it to all. Why 8stars then? just a comparative rating with all the movies I've seen. 1950s was surely the best decade of Hollywood in my opinion.

    Considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, 'Rear Window' follows the life L. B. Jeffries, portrayed brilliantly by James Stewart as a man trapped inside his own apartment following a leg injury. Temporarily in a wheelchair, the frustrated photographer spends his days staring outside of his rear window, observing the events of those around him, finding himself the witness of what he believes to be a murder. Grace Kelly plays the part of Jeffries' partner, Lisa Fremont as Hitchcock introduces us initially to the lives of the film's main characters for which we spend the majority of the first part of the film getting to know. It's through an incredibly detailed set, natural sound and great, natural shots that the viewer becomes involved in the film. Disabled, unable to move and only being able to see, from a distance, the actions of his neighbours, Jeffries' feels trapped and frustrated and his emotions can be felt in the way the film is displayed. Hitchcock, known as the master of suspense certainly lives up to this title in the film. Throughout we see the characters left in worrying and potentially dangerous situations, the viewer feels exactly like Jeffries on looking from a distance at situations developing beyond any type of control, wanting to intervene but ultimately being prevented to do so, frustratingly. The set and camera-work is utilised to the best it can be by Hitchcock who uses Jeffries' position 'spying' on others to explore a number of interesting sub-plots such as Miss Lonelyhearts lonely life, in one great scene she is scene acting out a dinner with herself, raising a glass to herself, an action mirrored by Jeffries who is watching. 'Rear Window' combines a mysterious thriller with romance, with a slight humorous and ironic feel as well. But the film is far from being violent; it's not a film in which the crime is a spectacle for the viewer but instead one that crime creates an eerie and worrying atmosphere through the mysterious and unknown possibilities. Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald gives a chilling performance, he is not needed to display himself emotionally for the majority which only builds up our expectations of the mysterious character before the film's final scenes occur, and the truth is revealed. Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is a great film and an extremely entertaining one to watch for so many reasons with great acting, brilliantly efficient use of a seemingly limiting set/location through excellent camera work and shots which help generate a mysterious and worrying atmosphere, creating suspense that builds up for the film's final scenes.

    The first film I saw by the British director. And it's a gruesomely dramatic Hitchcock movie. James Stewart (1908-1997) plays a photographer who has broken his leg. From his New York apartment he scouts the neighbors and believes himself to be a witness to a murder. Two female friends - played by Grace Kelly (1928-1982) and Thelma Ritter (1905-1969) - helps him solve the case. The film received four Oscar nominations, including best screenplay and directing, but did not win in any of the classes. Still counted as one of the director's best films. When it was filmed, it was filmed entirely indoors at Paramount Studios, this was the largest studio building ever in Hollywood. Cult Fact: This was the only film where Grace Kelly was smoking a cigarette. She refused to do it on any other film.

    Alfred Hitchcock was a master director, and Rear Window is a fine example of his extreme cleverness and subtlety. It's strange reviewing this film first after all of the Star Wars films, because they're complete polar opposites. Rear Window is a prime example of Hitchcock's genius, since, apart from one or two shots, the entire film is shot from James Stewart's apartment. This means that all action in the film, whether of Stewart and Kelly inside or the inhabitants of other apartments, is seen from the point of view of Stewart's character. This completely changes the way that we might view the film, since you're seeing it in the same way as Stewart  as a voyeur, peeking into the private lives of the other people on the block. It's extremely effective, and adds to the suspense of the film greatly. The story itself is both interesting and clever, with the main character trying to convince others that he has witnessed a murder, and attempting to find proof in what he sees whilst spying on his neighbours. Hitchcock introduces a large number of characters who we never properly meet, yet we feel that we know them very well. For example, "Miss Lonelyheart" is a character who at one point is about to commit suicide, and Hitchcock provides us with a good background to her story, as well as a fitting conclusion to it. The clearest evidence as to how much we have been spying on these people is their changes at the end of the film. We can clearly see how each group, whether it is the married couple, the songwriter or the dancer, has continued living and changed in the process. The murder case itself is very cleverly laid out, as is Stewart's logic throughout. Hitchcock knows exactly where to point the camera, constantly hinting to things which are later figured out. I was very proud that I figured out what the dog was doing far before any of the characters, since Hitchcock seemed to show him to us too frequently for his actions to be ordinary. The final battle is a bit over the top, but I thought Stewart's use of flash bulbs was a clever defence technique. However the build up to Mr. Thorwald entering his apartment is very tense and a tiny bit scary. On the whole this is an intelligent crime thriller, with a great insight into humanity's "spying and gossip" nature.

    this is my personal favorite Alfred Hitchcock film it is simply a masterpiece but there aren't any real twists at the end about the murders but it doesn't need any because the plot just strings you along the audience is the puppet and the director was the puppeteer if there is a top ten list for Hitchcock this movie is on the list it is just incredible the cast is great even the lonely Ms. Lonely hearts who is just in the background but she is great the neighbors are great the plot is great the characters are great everything is great about this movieand if you want to have a good edge of your seat thriller watch this film now

    Hitchcock was a master of his craft- everyone is aware of that- and his ideas revolutionized and popularized the thriller genre, one of my personal favorites. Skimming through his rich filmography, every addition is fueled by unmatched suspense. This is no different with one of Hitchcock's highly-acclaimed classics, Read Window. The film promises so much potential with its opening act in which the camera is technically the first participant and onlooker as it manages to give us a considerable amount of backstory without any verbal language in its first five minutes or so. It carefully observes a fascinating environment/setting- one in which every neighbor's life is visible through their open windows. The way the set was built and is in appearance is simply genius and (almost) never was the set of a film as crucial to its story and themes as it is here. Right from the get-go, you witness an underlying theme in that this picture conveys the isolated and individualistic nature of neighborhoods in our current world. No one seems to be interested in their neighbors besides Jeff (and he even mentions this in one of his clever lines) so much so that they aren't even concerned about what they're actually partaking in those rooms of theirs; the neighbors are never aware anyways. However, on the opposite side, it can be argued that people in current society are frankly too obsessed with another's conversation or activities. Apparently, we stick our noses in everyone's business, and it can be argued on a political scale as well. We do, in fact, watch our foreign neighbors far too closely with invasive binoculars, and in this manner, Jeff could actually be perceived as the villain of Rear Window in a way. In sum, there are countless perspectives one can judge this film from, occasionally conflicting with one another due to their opposing scopes. Anyways, I can't place my eye on the exact reason, but actors were so much more capable of delivering with a charming character back in those days because the audience immediately recognizes the charisma of the film's protagonist as he daringly speaks out with clever, hilarious, and/or downright convincingly serious lines. His lovable personality is loud and clear with the story's development, and eventually, it's met with the beauty of Grace Kelly's character (Lisa). On a side note, as the intriguing plot progressed, the whole idea undoubtedly reminded me of Disturbia (2007). Moving on, albeit its heavily suspenseful and compelling nature, there were some faults I happened to identify. First of all, did the entire case really mean that much to Jeff to the point where he just couldn't bring himself to yell out when Lisa, his future wife, was endangered by Mr. Thorwald's intimidating and threatening presence?

The clearest evidence as to how much we have been spying on these people is their changes at the end of the film. We can clearly see how each group, whether it is the married couple, the songwriter or the dancer, has continued living and changed in the process. The murder case itself is very cleverly laid out, as is Stewart's logic throughout. Hitchcock knows exactly where to point the camera, constantly hinting to things which are later figured out. I was very proud that I figured out what the dog was doing far before any of the characters, since Hitchcock seemed to show him to us too frequently for his actions to be ordinary. The final battle is a bit over the top, but I thought Stewart's use of flash bulbs was a clever defence technique. However the build up to Mr. Thorwald entering his apartment is very tense and a tiny bit scary. On the whole this is an intelligent crime thriller, with a great insight into humanity's "spying and gossip" nature.

    Hitchcock was a master of his craft- everyone is aware of that- and his ideas revolutionized and popularized the thriller genre, one of my personal favorites. Skimming through his rich filmography, every addition is fueled by unmatched suspense. This is no different with one of Hitchcock's highly-acclaimed classics, Read Window. The film promises so much potential with its opening act in which the camera is technically the first participant and onlooker as it manages to give us a considerable amount of backstory without any verbal language in its first five minutes or so. It carefully observes a fascinating environment/setting- one in which every neighbor's life is visible through their open windows. The way the set was built and is in appearance is simply genius and (almost) never was the set of a film as crucial to its story and themes as it is here. Right from the get-go, you witness an underlying theme in that this picture conveys the isolated and individualistic nature of neighborhoods in our current world. No one seems to be interested in their neighbors besides Jeff (and he even mentions this in one of his clever lines) so much so that they aren't even concerned about what they're actually partaking in those rooms of theirs; the neighbors are never aware anyways. However, on the opposite side, it can be argued that people in current society are frankly too obsessed with another's conversation or activities. Apparently, we stick our noses in everyone's business, and it can be argued on a political scale as well. We do, in fact, watch our foreign neighbors far too closely with invasive binoculars, and in this manner, Jeff could actually be perceived as the villain of Rear Window in a way. In sum, there are countless perspectives one can judge this film from, occasionally conflicting with one another due to their opposing scopes. Anyways, I can't place my eye on the exact reason, but actors were so much more capable of delivering with a charming character back in those days because the audience immediately recognizes the charisma of the film's protagonist as he daringly speaks out with clever, hilarious, and/or downright convincingly serious lines. His lovable personality is loud and clear with the story's development, and eventually, it's met with the beauty of Grace Kelly's character (Lisa). On a side note, as the intriguing plot progressed, the whole idea undoubtedly reminded me of Disturbia (2007). Moving on, albeit its heavily suspenseful and compelling nature, there were some faults I happened to identify. First of all, did the entire case really mean that much to Jeff to the point where he just couldn't bring himself to yell out when Lisa, his future wife, was endangered by Mr. Thorwald's intimidating and threatening presence? There was a sense of awkwardness in that I was viewing this curious fellow experiencing anxiety with visible sweat pouring down his face though he still continues to watch on as his love nears possible death. In addition, the result of this riveting mystery felt somewhat anticlimactic, and this slightly stemmed from the expectations one usually possesses upon viewing a Hitchcock film for there is usually a twist that shocks and awes the audience towards its end. We never got that from Rear Window as everything was exactly as it seemed. It could've been the main point of the feature, but still, I predicted the garden being the burial spot of the poor woman in the movie's first hour. And if the message of the film was that everything is truly as it seems, then why did another theme intrude the ending where you see a short, fat lover show up at the breathlessly gorgeous model's apartment? There and then, it seemed as if not everything is what it seems; so, already you have two contradictory (possible) themes on your plate. Which one was Hitchcock's actual intention? After all is said and done, Rear Window is a fantastic thriller with a not-as-satisfying end result, but it definitely impressed me the way most Hitchcock films have already. (North by Northwest is definitely next on my list.)

    This movie is on everyone's Top-Something list. Rightfully so. It is amazing that 99% of the movie is told from the single room. Hitchcock is at his best. He manages to keep the viewer is on the edge of his/her respective seat throughout the whole movie. He keeps the viewer in suspense through the whole thing. It is a very unique quality from a director who can keep one engaged and unless it's pointed out, you don't even realize that you haven't really changed scenes. Hitchcock is pure genius in this film. This is a film that even though I have seen it many times, somehow it always catches me. Now I make sure that I see this movie once a year. This is true cinema magic.

    Starting off with the pleasantries, the plot dives into something deeper. And that thing is the suspense in the first half. In the second half, however, the suspense is something else. It is the job & fun of the viewers to find it out. James Stewart is amazing, but the antagonist in here is adorable & in the limelight. Performances are immense & I am in love with the dialogs, especially those delivered by Stewart's smart alecky finesse. Music is fine, so is the direction. Cinematography is exceptional as is usual in a Hitchcock movie. I cannot end this without mentioning that apart from crime & investigation & spying, large part of it deals with relationships, slapstick & heavy sarcasm which is, of course, a treat for eyes & ears. Being not an original work, I rate it a huge 8.6 out of 10 for the maximum entertainment. Although, I cannot dub this as the makers' best. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended. A wonderful suspense thriller with humor. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Violence/Gore: Implied; Mild visuals | Sex/Nudity: Implied; No visuals | Smoking/Drugs: Very Mild | Alcohol: Mediocre | Mouth-Kiss: Mediocre | Nudity: Mild

    "Rear Window" is an another Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. This movie has to do with a photographer who spies his neighbors only from his apartment and he is convinced that one of them has committed a murder. James Stewart plays as L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies a photographer of a newspaper and the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont who is a high society fashion consultant and his girlfriend. I like more this old version than the new one with Christopher Reeve and Daryl Hannah. I can not compare these two because the differences between these two films are many and the time difference (44 years) are too much, but I stay in my opinion that the old version is better than the new one.

    Action photographer and journalist,"Jeff" (played by Jimmy Stewart) is wheel chair bound with a broken leg. His only activities during his convalescence are visits from the insurance nurse (played by and watching his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. He has visits from his glamorous model and dress designer girlfriend, Lisa (played by Grace Kelly) while he plays peeping Tom on his neighbors. Jeff watches his neighbors daily, even naming them (ex. Miss Torso, a dancer; Miss Lonely Heart, has dinner parties with imaginary friends; and the music man). From the opening scenes of Rear Window, the transitions and pace of the film are apparent. Immediately, we know what the main character does and how he became wheel chair bound. The film flows from the image of a thermometer to Jeff; his broken leg and wheel chair. The scene smoothly transitions to the broken camera and crash pictures on his wall and lastly a negative film image of a woman. This scene and several others are shot without spoken word. It is the transition of the images that speaks to the viewer and creates the suspense of what may or may not happen. The timing and transition of each piece of film tells the back story so we have information about Jeff and why he is viewing his word through the rear window of his apartment building. In 1 hour and 55 minutes, you are taken on a suspenseful ride of psychological terror. The movie follows an indirect subjective point of view, as we are drawn into the action. The director, Alfred Hitchcock, has once again pulled the viewer into his world of voyeurism and suspense. This movie is in his typical style where the blonde is elevated to a status and the male role either feels he is not good enough as in Jeff in Rear Window, or obsessed with her like the character Norman Bates. As in both movies the female lead is in jeopardy creating a back story to the suspense.

    Rear window is a great film. It couldn't have been any better. Direction is absolutely top notch, characters so strong, wonderfully scripted. Great acting, attention to details is of highest standard. I loved the role of Grace Kelly in the film. not only she's the most beautiful actress I've ever seen, but I was so impressed about her real life and depressed by her fate. Cant't wait to grab the new Nicole Kidman movie based on her life, Grace of Monaco. This is the best Hitchcock film I've seen yet, and I would certainly recommend it to all. Why 8stars then? just a comparative rating with all the movies I've seen. 1950s was surely the best decade of Hollywood in my opinion.

    Considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, 'Rear Window' follows the life L. B. Jeffries, portrayed brilliantly by James Stewart as a man trapped inside his own apartment following a leg injury. Temporarily in a wheelchair, the frustrated photographer spends his days staring outside of his rear window, observing the events of those around him, finding himself the witness of what he believes to be a murder. Grace Kelly plays the part of Jeffries' partner, Lisa Fremont as Hitchcock introduces us initially to the lives of the film's main characters for which we spend the majority of the first part of the film getting to know. It's through an incredibly detailed set, natural sound and great, natural shots that the viewer becomes involved in the film. Disabled, unable to move and only being able to see, from a distance, the actions of his neighbours, Jeffries' feels trapped and frustrated and his emotions can be felt in the way the film is displayed. Hitchcock, known as the master of suspense certainly lives up to this title in the film. Throughout we see the characters left in worrying and potentially dangerous situations, the viewer feels exactly like Jeffries on looking from a distance at situations developing beyond any type of control, wanting to intervene but ultimately being prevented to do so, frustratingly. The set and camera-work is utilised to the best it can be by Hitchcock who uses Jeffries' position 'spying' on others to explore a number of interesting sub-plots such as Miss Lonelyhearts lonely life, in one great scene she is scene acting out a dinner with herself, raising a glass to herself, an action mirrored by Jeffries who is watching. 'Rear Window' combines a mysterious thriller with romance, with a slight humorous and ironic feel as well. But the film is far from being violent; it's not a film in which the crime is a spectacle for the viewer but instead one that crime creates an eerie and worrying atmosphere through the mysterious and unknown possibilities. Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald gives a chilling performance, he is not needed to display himself emotionally for the majority which only builds up our expectations of the mysterious character before the film's final scenes occur, and the truth is revealed. Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is a great film and an extremely entertaining one to watch for so many reasons with great acting, brilliantly efficient use of a seemingly limiting set/location through excellent camera work and shots which help generate a mysterious and worrying atmosphere, creating suspense that builds up for the film's final scenes.

    The first film I saw by the British director. And it's a gruesomely dramatic Hitchcock movie. James Stewart (1908-1997) plays a photographer who has broken his leg. From his New York apartment he scouts the neighbors and believes himself to be a witness to a murder. Two female friends - played by Grace Kelly (1928-1982) and Thelma Ritter (1905-1969) - helps him solve the case. The film received four Oscar nominations, including best screenplay and directing, but did not win in any of the classes. Still counted as one of the director's best films. When it was filmed, it was filmed entirely indoors at Paramount Studios, this was the largest studio building ever in Hollywood. Cult Fact: This was the only film where Grace Kelly was smoking a cigarette. She refused to do it on any other film.

    Alfred Hitchcock was a master director, and Rear Window is a fine example of his extreme cleverness and subtlety. It's strange reviewing this film first after all of the Star Wars films, because they're complete polar opposites. Rear Window is a prime example of Hitchcock's genius, since, apart from one or two shots, the entire film is shot from James Stewart's apartment. This means that all action in the film, whether of Stewart and Kelly inside or the inhabitants of other apartments, is seen from the point of view of Stewart's character. This completely changes the way that we might view the film, since you're seeing it in the same way as Stewart  as a voyeur, peeking into the private lives of the other people on the block. It's extremely effective, and adds to the suspense of the film greatly. The story itself is both interesting and clever, with the main character trying to convince others that he has witnessed a murder, and attempting to find proof in what he sees whilst spying on his neighbours. Hitchcock introduces a large number of characters who we never properly meet, yet we feel that we know them very well. For example, "Miss Lonelyheart" is a character who at one point is about to commit suicide, and Hitchcock provides us with a good background to her story, as well as a fitting conclusion to it. The clearest evidence as to how much we have been spying on these people is their changes at the end of the film. We can clearly see how each group, whether it is the married couple, the songwriter or the dancer, has continued living and changed in the process. The murder case itself is very cleverly laid out, as is Stewart's logic throughout. Hitchcock knows exactly where to point the camera, constantly hinting to things which are later figured out. I was very proud that I figured out what the dog was doing far before any of the characters, since Hitchcock seemed to show him to us too frequently for his actions to be ordinary. The final battle is a bit over the top, but I thought Stewart's use of flash bulbs was a clever defence technique. However the build up to Mr. Thorwald entering his apartment is very tense and a tiny bit scary. On the whole this is an intelligent crime thriller, with a great insight into humanity's "spying and gossip" nature.
