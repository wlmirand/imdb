    As other reviewers have noted, the first half of this film is effectively a semi-remake of The Defiant Ones (without the racial overtones) as we see chained together computer hacker Stephen Baldwin and undercover cop Larry Fishburne flee from a chain gang. Their bid for freedom is complicated by the fact that Baldwin and his partner hacked into the computer system of a Mafia mobster who is now desperate to get his hands on the disk they have containing the information. The odd couple are aided in their escape by an accommodating Salma Hayek. Fled is highly derivative of other action movies, but also has the kind of momentum that prevents you from disliking it too much. Just when you're starting to dwell on the pedestrian dialogue, the clich&eacute;d situation or the plot holes, another action set piece comes along and makes you forget them all for a while. The characters are also constantly referencing other movies throughout - a clue perhaps that the screenwriter Preston A. Whitmore has allowed himself to be influenced by too many of the films he has seen and liked while penning this opus. Best viewed as bubble-gum for the brain when you're tired of thinking and just want to sit back and sink a couple of beers in front of the TV.

An adventure plot ensues, involving a missing floppy disk, an attractive woman that assists them, a sinister Federal marshal, an honest cop, and the Cuban mafia.... Sounded like a good idea at the time. Baldwin who was reasonably fresh from 'The Usual Suspects' and Larry 'I'll Change my name to Laurence' Fishburne, chained together and on the run, sounded like it could have been a good buddy movie with lots of one liners and good set pieces. It isn't i'm afraid. What you get is stereotypical characters coming and going, weak plot, and cheap production values, only made better by half decent performances from Patton And Fishbourne. It tries to be too clever for it's own good, with in jokes to films featuring cast members, and having silly twist after silly twist, making it just too boring come the end. If Hooks had watched a few cannon films from the eighties and focused on the action rather than the incomprehensible story, this would have been an amazing, funny if un-original action film. what we get is un-original and bored. Flee.

    10 years ago I watched it. And it's clear that ever since it provokes the hell out of me continually; Bladwin's face hunts me in the nightmares, fear out of meeting it again while changing the channels, ..etc. I didn't have any intension to write a full review about it. Maybe because it doesn't worth it? Maybe I don't want to go through the horror once again ? Though, something pushed me to finally do it. Simply I discovered lately that I, unintentionally, handled it 3 times already (as you see the spirit of revenge is alive and eager !). It holds the record for being in 3 shame lists I edited before (they are all published in the IMDb's pages). You can find it in my lists of "1996's Top 10 Worst Comedies", "The Worst 10 Buddy-Movies" and "The Silliest 10 Buddies in Buddy-Movies" (guess who ?!). As you see all what I was trying to do is just warning my fellow humans who didn't watch it yet. It'll make you ask and ask : Is it a remake of (The Defiant Ones) ? Laurence Fishburne in a comic scenes ?!, Stephen Baldwin in a movie ?!!! I'll never forget a line was said by one of the evil characters while menacing someone "I'll make you wear your ass as a hat !" what was that anyway ??! Is it a hint about the makers of it as people think with their asses ?! I can't settle is it a crime action comedy, or a crime of action and comedy ?! It is B-grade B-movie with noisy episodes, TV-ish persona and unfunny everything. There are many references to many movies but it isn't a spoof or a respectable tribute inasmuch as a bad spoof of itself and shameful tribute. So it's poor man's The Defiant Ones, poor man's Lethal Weapon, and poor is the man who sat to watch it ! There is a big surprise about Fishburne's character at the very end, but you know what? The dumbness of the whole thing would force you to not buy it, or maybe to laugh at it ! Stephen Bladwin?? I think that they picked him for just being so white in front of Laurence Fishburne ! Now this is the way how Not to deliver comedy. Watching him trying to be comic will make you lose your temper. It is nice to act like a fool, giving a laugh out of that. But awfully Bladwin looks like a real fool ! And the interplay between him and Fishburne ?? Well, you can say that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde had better chance ! Originally, who the hell might think that Bladwin can do comedy (or else) ? Fishburne himself looked like something cooked hastily in boiling water, let's say looked like the movie itself (How Horrible !). He was acting uninterested, being not familiar with this kind of Hollywood's nonsense yet, or refusing it? Anyway, I hated whatever he delivered so much. He seemed provocative to the ultimate degree with a dull, rather dead, face all the time. So the true ridiculousness of the 2 leads plus the no-chemistry between them destroyed any possible chance for this movie to hit even the mark of "watchable". Speaking about actors, I think that I glimpsed accidentally Salma Hayic in here. She was sweet and cute as usual. Hmmm, I believe that in hard times we just dream of our dear ones ! Yes, I keep telling myself that she was a dream since my mind can't stand the possibility of "if she was really there", otherwise WHY THEY DIDN'T USE HER BETTER ???!!! In another planet that could have been funny and entertaining, with box office success and maybe Part 2! It's nothing but another cinematic interpretation of popcorn. It was only tasteless popcorn this time. The thing is it wanted to be fun, but obviously their makers weren't funny enough. To be fair, it can be so amusing yet for anyone wants to experience what the silly buddy-action comedy is all about. Still there is one great thing about it; the fact that Stephen Bladwin didn't return afterwards to be in any comic action again. Ahhh, a few things in this life can be right, soooo right ! If, after all of that, you're intent on watching it.. Then be aware, because I'm sure...you'd witness the weirdest thing, when you feel during all the viewing that you're wearing you're a** as a hat !

    The unlikeliest of partners, Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin are chained together and make a jail break together from a Georgia road gang. It's now the Nineties and objections about a black and white convict being chained together are now pass&eacute;. Even with race not a really big issue with these two guys as it was in The Defiant Ones, they've still got a lot of other problems. The most curious thing about this is the interest the Feds have in this jailbreak. They're keeping the Atlanta PD cop who busted Baldwin in the loop, but at a distance and this arouses Will Patton's curiosity no end. US Marshal Robert John Burke is playing things way too close to the vest to suit Patton. Baldwin's who they're after. He's a computer hacker who hacked into a holding company that the Cuban Mafia owns and ripped off 25 million dollars. The local Cuban don, Michael Nader, wants him real bad. The wild thing in this film is that he's the only one in the cast who is what he says he is. A couple of current beauties, Selma Hayek and Brittany Powell, decorate this film as love interests for both Fisburne and Baldwin. Hayek is introduced rather clumsily into the situation that our escapees find themselves in. In fact the film, enjoyable though it is in many places, could have been a lot better with a much tighter script. Director Kevin Hooks did a good job with what he was given. In fact Kevin Hooks got to cast his dad Robert Hooks in a role as the Atlanta PD supervisor for Patton. Fled is not a bad film, it could have used a lot of improvement though in the writing.

    Of course many people will say this movie was irrational and unoriginal, and truthfully, it was. But beside the lack of creativity, the film was actually a fun little action flick. The film is split into two main segments. The first part is a fugitive run away type chase that is somewhat entertaining. The 2nd takes part in the city that consists of many twists and "dramatic" deaths. Neither of these parts are amazingly great but they are both watchable. Fishburne is the stiff no nonsense character that he usually is and Baldwin is the rather silly but intelligent technical geek. The film, in my opinion, is somewhat of a homage to older action films and was worth a watch. Story 6/10 Action 7/10 Acting 6/10 Watchability 6/10 Total 6/10

    Not really too sure what to think of this movie. On the one hand it's a fast going action flick that is always on the movie and on the other hand it's a movie with a real muddled main plot that makes some odd choices with its characters and story elements. Here we have two tough convicts that escaped but are still friendly enough to save a little boy from being run over and they bring a man to the hospital who tried to shoot them but than got an heart attack in the process. There are some moralistic elements in the movie that seem highly out of place, especially when the main characters in the progress of the movie shoot around a lot without worrying too much about any innocent bystanders. It's such a ridicules contradicting contrast. it's just one of the story elements that makes "Fled" a pretty weak movie to watch. Also it's main plot line just never really seems to get off the ground. It's one of those stories you simply couldn't care less about and simply pay very little attention to it. Because of this also not all of the characters really work out in the movie. Actors such as Will Patton and Robert John Burke walk around in this movie but you can wonder why really. Their characters were potentially good ones but they simply got not used very well and only pop up once in a while, causing them to also make a pretty redundant impression. Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor and he really shows that in this movie. He gives away one fine performance, that alone still makes this movie still somewhat worthwhile. Stephen Baldwin is also not too bad in this movie and he forms a good duo with Fishburne. It's overall style also made the movie seem as if it was not to sure what it wanted to be. At times it showed the signs of a mismatched buddy comedy flick while at other times it was a pure violent action flick. So no, the movie also lacked a real clear consistent style, which also makes the viewer a bit uneasy on how to watch and approach the movie. It on the other hand is a fast going action in which basically always something is happening. No it's not always something good or interesting but at least it's not a slow or boring movie. It gives the movie definitely some watchable value. The action itself also isn't too bad and mostly consists out of shooting and a couple of chases. So no, also nothing too original here and it's a pretty formulaic standard action/thriller movie but it's definitely not the worst one around in its genre. A movie that definitely had some more potential in its core and could had worked out with a different and better approach of the overall story and character treatments. It still remains a somewhat watchable movie though thanks to it's principal actors and good action movie style of film-making. 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Fled is the kind of a movie just should have been made with a tongue-in-cheek attitude to have been even a slight success. As it is, it's just too serious for it's own good. I mean, let's face it, Fled has to be the mother of all action movie clich&eacute;s. This in mind, i find Dodge's constant references to masterpieces such as Deliverance and The Godfather kind of funny, and kind of sad. Admittably Hooks knows how to make your standard action movie, the action is good and the acting is solid. The dialogue is quite awful, but i'm assuming you know how to turn your brain off for a while to enjoy movies like this. I was hoping the bike scene would have been a bit longer, considering how badly the 4-5 (what i thought would have been the) final scenes dragged on. If you like action movies and you're having a free day with no plans, go for it! It's nice easy watching, don't let the rating (even though it's pretty dead on) stop you. I enjoyed it.

    As with many movies, as long as the viewer doesn't read too much into the movie you will do OK! Its a fun fast paced road movie-ish, fugitive styled chase movie. It's well filmed, and slickly edited for a low budget chase flick.The acting is simply and solidly done even if the dialogue is a tad cheesy. Steven Baldwin is the token down at the heel hero, Laurence Fishburne is cool as the mentor type character, pulling the hero out of one fix after another. Salma Hayek is as stunning as ever but the best character is Gib played by Will Hatton, a highly likable character whos putting the puzzle together as the heros run around. Not a classic but worth a late night look see when you get home from the pub with a bag of munchies.

    Did you know that the word "fugitive" derives from the Latin word meaning "flee"? Whether or not you do, it should be easy to figure out that "Fled" is almost a total repeat of "The Fugitive". It's another story of two guys chained together having to escape, all the while hating each other until they realize that they have to rely on each other; "The Defiant Ones" and "Runaway Train" did a much better job. This one, on the other hand, is basically a litany of car chases, explosions, etc. Laurence Fishburne has starred in far better movies, and even Stephen Baldwin appeared in "The Usual Suspects"; I can forgive Salma Hayek for starring in this, as it was early in her career. Anyway, it's not worth your time. Also starring Robert John Burke and Robert Hooks, and they probably don't wish to stress this in their resumes.

    I accidentally stumbled on this movie channel surfing and now regret channel surfing! How bad a movie is this in that the acting is horrible. Mr. Baldwin please note only Brando and Dean could get away with the attitude and look you try to convey here. As for Mr Fishburne I have had enough of Black actors conveying that everyone in the world owes them. The original of this movie was the Defiant Ones with two great actors in Tony Curtis and Sydney Poitier and was a classic in story line and acting, this is BAD. There is a scene early in the movie where a good ole boy holds a shotgun on the two escaped convicts,but talks to them and does not shoot them. He would have done us all a favor and finished the movie there and then

Because of this also not all of the characters really work out in the movie. Actors such as Will Patton and Robert John Burke walk around in this movie but you can wonder why really. Their characters were potentially good ones but they simply got not used very well and only pop up once in a while, causing them to also make a pretty redundant impression. Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor and he really shows that in this movie. He gives away one fine performance, that alone still makes this movie still somewhat worthwhile. Stephen Baldwin is also not too bad in this movie and he forms a good duo with Fishburne. It's overall style also made the movie seem as if it was not to sure what it wanted to be. At times it showed the signs of a mismatched buddy comedy flick while at other times it was a pure violent action flick. So no, the movie also lacked a real clear consistent style, which also makes the viewer a bit uneasy on how to watch and approach the movie. It on the other hand is a fast going action in which basically always something is happening. No it's not always something good or interesting but at least it's not a slow or boring movie. It gives the movie definitely some watchable value. The action itself also isn't too bad and mostly consists out of shooting and a couple of chases. So no, also nothing too original here and it's a pretty formulaic standard action/thriller movie but it's definitely not the worst one around in its genre. A movie that definitely had some more potential in its core and could had worked out with a different and better approach of the overall story and character treatments. It still remains a somewhat watchable movie though thanks to it's principal actors and good action movie style of film-making. 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Fled is the kind of a movie just should have been made with a tongue-in-cheek attitude to have been even a slight success. As it is, it's just too serious for it's own good. I mean, let's face it, Fled has to be the mother of all action movie clich&eacute;s. This in mind, i find Dodge's constant references to masterpieces such as Deliverance and The Godfather kind of funny, and kind of sad. Admittably Hooks knows how to make your standard action movie, the action is good and the acting is solid. The dialogue is quite awful, but i'm assuming you know how to turn your brain off for a while to enjoy movies like this. I was hoping the bike scene would have been a bit longer, considering how badly the 4-5 (what i thought would have been the) final scenes dragged on. If you like action movies and you're having a free day with no plans, go for it! It's nice easy watching, don't let the rating (even though it's pretty dead on) stop you. I enjoyed it.

    As with many movies, as long as the viewer doesn't read too much into the movie you will do OK! Its a fun fast paced road movie-ish, fugitive styled chase movie. It's well filmed, and slickly edited for a low budget chase flick.The acting is simply and solidly done even if the dialogue is a tad cheesy. Steven Baldwin is the token down at the heel hero, Laurence Fishburne is cool as the mentor type character, pulling the hero out of one fix after another. Salma Hayek is as stunning as ever but the best character is Gib played by Will Hatton, a highly likable character whos putting the puzzle together as the heros run around. Not a classic but worth a late night look see when you get home from the pub with a bag of munchies.

    Did you know that the word "fugitive" derives from the Latin word meaning "flee"? Whether or not you do, it should be easy to figure out that "Fled" is almost a total repeat of "The Fugitive". It's another story of two guys chained together having to escape, all the while hating each other until they realize that they have to rely on each other; "The Defiant Ones" and "Runaway Train" did a much better job. This one, on the other hand, is basically a litany of car chases, explosions, etc. Laurence Fishburne has starred in far better movies, and even Stephen Baldwin appeared in "The Usual Suspects"; I can forgive Salma Hayek for starring in this, as it was early in her career. Anyway, it's not worth your time. Also starring Robert John Burke and Robert Hooks, and they probably don't wish to stress this in their resumes.

    I accidentally stumbled on this movie channel surfing and now regret channel surfing! How bad a movie is this in that the acting is horrible. Mr. Baldwin please note only Brando and Dean could get away with the attitude and look you try to convey here. As for Mr Fishburne I have had enough of Black actors conveying that everyone in the world owes them. The original of this movie was the Defiant Ones with two great actors in Tony Curtis and Sydney Poitier and was a classic in story line and acting, this is BAD. There is a scene early in the movie where a good ole boy holds a shotgun on the two escaped convicts,but talks to them and does not shoot them. He would have done us all a favor and finished the movie there and then

    As other reviewers have noted, the first half of this film is effectively a semi-remake of The Defiant Ones (without the racial overtones) as we see chained together computer hacker Stephen Baldwin and undercover cop Larry Fishburne flee from a chain gang. Their bid for freedom is complicated by the fact that Baldwin and his partner hacked into the computer system of a Mafia mobster who is now desperate to get his hands on the disk they have containing the information. The odd couple are aided in their escape by an accommodating Salma Hayek. Fled is highly derivative of other action movies, but also has the kind of momentum that prevents you from disliking it too much. Just when you're starting to dwell on the pedestrian dialogue, the clich&eacute;d situation or the plot holes, another action set piece comes along and makes you forget them all for a while. The characters are also constantly referencing other movies throughout - a clue perhaps that the screenwriter Preston A. Whitmore has allowed himself to be influenced by too many of the films he has seen and liked while penning this opus. Best viewed as bubble-gum for the brain when you're tired of thinking and just want to sit back and sink a couple of beers in front of the TV.

    Dodge is a computer hacker serving a prison term; Piper is a tough guy. They end up chained together, and flee during a chain-gang escape attempt that goes bad. An adventure plot ensues, involving a missing floppy disk, an attractive woman that assists them, a sinister Federal marshal, an honest cop, and the Cuban mafia.... Sounded like a good idea at the time. Baldwin who was reasonably fresh from 'The Usual Suspects' and Larry 'I'll Change my name to Laurence' Fishburne, chained together and on the run, sounded like it could have been a good buddy movie with lots of one liners and good set pieces. It isn't i'm afraid. What you get is stereotypical characters coming and going, weak plot, and cheap production values, only made better by half decent performances from Patton And Fishbourne. It tries to be too clever for it's own good, with in jokes to films featuring cast members, and having silly twist after silly twist, making it just too boring come the end. If Hooks had watched a few cannon films from the eighties and focused on the action rather than the incomprehensible story, this would have been an amazing, funny if un-original action film. what we get is un-original and bored. Flee.

    10 years ago I watched it. And it's clear that ever since it provokes the hell out of me continually; Bladwin's face hunts me in the nightmares, fear out of meeting it again while changing the channels, ..etc. I didn't have any intension to write a full review about it. Maybe because it doesn't worth it? Maybe I don't want to go through the horror once again ? Though, something pushed me to finally do it. Simply I discovered lately that I, unintentionally, handled it 3 times already (as you see the spirit of revenge is alive and eager !). It holds the record for being in 3 shame lists I edited before (they are all published in the IMDb's pages). You can find it in my lists of "1996's Top 10 Worst Comedies", "The Worst 10 Buddy-Movies" and "The Silliest 10 Buddies in Buddy-Movies" (guess who ?!). As you see all what I was trying to do is just warning my fellow humans who didn't watch it yet. It'll make you ask and ask : Is it a remake of (The Defiant Ones) ? Laurence Fishburne in a comic scenes ?!, Stephen Baldwin in a movie ?!!! I'll never forget a line was said by one of the evil characters while menacing someone "I'll make you wear your ass as a hat !" what was that anyway ??! Is it a hint about the makers of it as people think with their asses ?! I can't settle is it a crime action comedy, or a crime of action and comedy ?! It is B-grade B-movie with noisy episodes, TV-ish persona and unfunny everything. There are many references to many movies but it isn't a spoof or a respectable tribute inasmuch as a bad spoof of itself and shameful tribute. So it's poor man's The Defiant Ones, poor man's Lethal Weapon, and poor is the man who sat to watch it ! There is a big surprise about Fishburne's character at the very end, but you know what? The dumbness of the whole thing would force you to not buy it, or maybe to laugh at it ! Stephen Bladwin?? I think that they picked him for just being so white in front of Laurence Fishburne ! Now this is the way how Not to deliver comedy. Watching him trying to be comic will make you lose your temper. It is nice to act like a fool, giving a laugh out of that. But awfully Bladwin looks like a real fool ! And the interplay between him and Fishburne ?? Well, you can say that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde had better chance ! Originally, who the hell might think that Bladwin can do comedy (or else) ? Fishburne himself looked like something cooked hastily in boiling water, let's say looked like the movie itself (How Horrible !). He was acting uninterested, being not familiar with this kind of Hollywood's nonsense yet, or refusing it? Anyway, I hated whatever he delivered so much. He seemed provocative to the ultimate degree with a dull, rather dead, face all the time. So the true ridiculousness of the 2 leads plus the no-chemistry between them destroyed any possible chance for this movie to hit even the mark of "watchable". Speaking about actors, I think that I glimpsed accidentally Salma Hayic in here. She was sweet and cute as usual. Hmmm, I believe that in hard times we just dream of our dear ones ! Yes, I keep telling myself that she was a dream since my mind can't stand the possibility of "if she was really there", otherwise WHY THEY DIDN'T USE HER BETTER ???!!! In another planet that could have been funny and entertaining, with box office success and maybe Part 2! It's nothing but another cinematic interpretation of popcorn. It was only tasteless popcorn this time. The thing is it wanted to be fun, but obviously their makers weren't funny enough. To be fair, it can be so amusing yet for anyone wants to experience what the silly buddy-action comedy is all about. Still there is one great thing about it; the fact that Stephen Bladwin didn't return afterwards to be in any comic action again. Ahhh, a few things in this life can be right, soooo right ! If, after all of that, you're intent on watching it.. Then be aware, because I'm sure...you'd witness the weirdest thing, when you feel during all the viewing that you're wearing you're a** as a hat !

    The unlikeliest of partners, Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin are chained together and make a jail break together from a Georgia road gang. It's now the Nineties and objections about a black and white convict being chained together are now pass&eacute;. Even with race not a really big issue with these two guys as it was in The Defiant Ones, they've still got a lot of other problems. The most curious thing about this is the interest the Feds have in this jailbreak. They're keeping the Atlanta PD cop who busted Baldwin in the loop, but at a distance and this arouses Will Patton's curiosity no end. US Marshal Robert John Burke is playing things way too close to the vest to suit Patton. Baldwin's who they're after. He's a computer hacker who hacked into a holding company that the Cuban Mafia owns and ripped off 25 million dollars. The local Cuban don, Michael Nader, wants him real bad. The wild thing in this film is that he's the only one in the cast who is what he says he is. A couple of current beauties, Selma Hayek and Brittany Powell, decorate this film as love interests for both Fisburne and Baldwin. Hayek is introduced rather clumsily into the situation that our escapees find themselves in. In fact the film, enjoyable though it is in many places, could have been a lot better with a much tighter script. Director Kevin Hooks did a good job with what he was given. In fact Kevin Hooks got to cast his dad Robert Hooks in a role as the Atlanta PD supervisor for Patton. Fled is not a bad film, it could have used a lot of improvement though in the writing.

    Of course many people will say this movie was irrational and unoriginal, and truthfully, it was. But beside the lack of creativity, the film was actually a fun little action flick. The film is split into two main segments. The first part is a fugitive run away type chase that is somewhat entertaining. The 2nd takes part in the city that consists of many twists and "dramatic" deaths. Neither of these parts are amazingly great but they are both watchable. Fishburne is the stiff no nonsense character that he usually is and Baldwin is the rather silly but intelligent technical geek. The film, in my opinion, is somewhat of a homage to older action films and was worth a watch. Story 6/10 Action 7/10 Acting 6/10 Watchability 6/10 Total 6/10

    Not really too sure what to think of this movie. On the one hand it's a fast going action flick that is always on the movie and on the other hand it's a movie with a real muddled main plot that makes some odd choices with its characters and story elements. Here we have two tough convicts that escaped but are still friendly enough to save a little boy from being run over and they bring a man to the hospital who tried to shoot them but than got an heart attack in the process. There are some moralistic elements in the movie that seem highly out of place, especially when the main characters in the progress of the movie shoot around a lot without worrying too much about any innocent bystanders. It's such a ridicules contradicting contrast. it's just one of the story elements that makes "Fled" a pretty weak movie to watch. Also it's main plot line just never really seems to get off the ground. It's one of those stories you simply couldn't care less about and simply pay very little attention to it.
