    Spellbound is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a really impressive cast that all play their characters with great heart and passion.It definitely wasn't what I was expecting it to be,mostly because its directed by Alfred Hitchcock,its suppose to be a thriller but I wasn't very thrilled,I thought the story was really good,but it just wasn't that exciting,and a story like that sounds like they could have made it a lot more mysterious and strange.The best part of the movie was without a doubt the music,which it won an Academy Award for and it really deserved it,the music is truly outstanding and you will have it stuck in your head long after he movie ends.Fans f Alfred Hitchcock shouldn't expect a lot of thrills from Spellbound,but Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck still make it enjoyable. A female psychiatrist falls in love with her amnesiac patient although she is aware he may be a killer.

    There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching. Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont. She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk. Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's "women's pictures," and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation. Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word: "Liverwurst." Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch. A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like: "We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes," you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had. Much of "Spellbound" feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dal&iacute; is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. ("I hate men. I loathe them.") There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dal&iacute;, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open. Constance's diagnosis of "Edwardes" problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely "a trick of the mind for staying sane"? At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff. Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!") Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

    Spellbound: One heck of a solid picture, but unfortunately, Spellbound only sets its sights in the middle of my radar and never reaches for anything higher. It's satisfied with being satisfactory. Bergman is dependable with her acting here, but Gregory Peck is the real star in my opinion. It's either a hit or miss performance; for me, he gave an arresting performance. Michael Chekhov is lively in his supporting role, too. Hitchcock doesn't attack the material, almost like his focus wasn't there the entire time, but he doesn't do anything wrong. The film's strongest area is the score; the dramatic music echoes the motivations of the characters. The twisty ending is a nice way to conclude the picture. Spellbound is good, but no where near great. It's uncanny to me that Hitchcock was nominated for his work here, but not for Vertigo, The Birds, or any other wonderful work. Rating: B+ Grade: 7.5/10

    There are three good things about "Spellbound": a gorgeous young Gregory Peck, a memorable dream sequence and the kind of killer supporting performances that deprives the lead roles from their last bits of believability, whether Michael Chekov as the scene-stealing Dr. Tchekov or Leo G. Carrel as the enigmatic Doctor I-forgot-his-name. The rest is typical Hitchcock, which is not to diminish the film's merit but not saying much either. Like I said in the title, the film is like an "Inception" made in the 40's, using all Christopher Nolan's darlings: a mystery, a psychological thriller and naturally, a romance as the driving subplot. Wouldn't we, after all, expect a love at first sight, between two of the most attractive stars of the 40's: Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck? Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a cold and emotionless psychiatrist who works in Green Manors institute. This is how her character is set-up anyway, with her glasses and snobbish attitude, she stands on a symbolical pedestal, constantly -allow me the word- erected by her colleagues' seductive moves. Who'd blame them? she's the only female of the staff, and not the least. Granted Hitchcock is not the most subtle director when it comes to romance, it's still frustrating to see the distinguished Constance Petersen turn into an enamored teenager as soon as the institute's new Head makes his entrance, but who'd blame her either? It's Gregory Peck for cinematic Gods' sake! Peck as gorgeous as ever, and his beauty is so distracting (should I specify I'm a straight male) that you forgive all the little flaws on the characterization department, and gosh, there are some! Peck as Dr. Edwards strikes as too young a man, much more, there's something in his eyes obviously betraying a hidden trauma. His first dinner with the staff provides the first hints: all it takes for Petersen is to draw some lines with a fork on the tablecloth to hit a sensitive chord in Peck, who suddenly becomes more aggressive. The mystery picks up and Edwards turns into an intriguing subject for Constance  it's up to us to wonder whether it's for professional psychoanalysis or something else tickling her body. Sinning again with obviousness, it doesn't take much time before the second incident occurs and reveals an unconcealed wound in Peck, a trauma that nourished a guilt complex with subsequent amnesia, something medically typical; take the word from the experts. Later, Constance discovers that the playboy is not the real Edwards, who mysteriously disappeared, and she can't (or doesn't want to) believe the impostor who claims to have murdered the doctor. Naturally, we don't believe it either, which lessens the intensity of the mystery, since when something is too obvious to the point of being claimed several times, we know the psychoanalysis is meant to clear the doubts, so Petersen finally allows herself to love her patient. "Spellbound" acknowledges its tribute to the virtues of psychoanalysis, the treatment of Freud's discipline is rather rudimentary, but it does provide an interesting touch of surrealism notably through the iconic dream sequence. "Spellbound" is renowned for the dream part, designed by Salvador Dali himself. And those who saw "Un Chien Andalou" will immediately recognize a wink to the infamous eye-cutting moment of Bunuel's masterpiece. The sequence lasted more than twenty minutes but the original cut severely shortened it, only leaving the hints that could be associated with Edwards' murder. "Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective. Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor. I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect. Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.

    A female psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) protects the identity of an amnesia patient (Gregory Peck) accused of murder while attempting to recover his memory. This is a very special kind of mystery. Not only do we have to figure out whether or not the accused was actually guilty of the crime, but we have to work through his issues of why he has blocked the incident out. Will his remembering exonerate him? Or is he only building a case against himself? I watched this solely because it was recommended for the Salvador Dali dream sequence. Actually, the film as a whole is excellent. The sequence, known for the eyes, is not the most interesting part.

    Psychoanalysis made its way onto the screen many times and certainly in the early days, Hollywood hardly ever achieved anything worth much. Film-Noir was a common Genre that ventured in and out of this World, but even there where much is forbidden the elusive Practice and descriptions of Psychiatry were forever searching for expository verbiage and most of the time it was rendered ridiculous and pedestrian. Even with masters like Hitchcock and Writer Ben Hecht it was a discipline that defied explanatory sentences and were much too deep to be believed in short Scenes or even whole Movies. The hopelessly dated stuff like "Guilt Complex", here the term used over and over, is just is too simple to explain the complexities of the mind and the relation to the plot. The Dream analysis is also contrived to the point that it surrenders all believability. So this Film that so seriously tries to make it all fit and function as steps and paths for the Story to unfold is pathetically forced and can be too much to sustain. There is enough here to be interesting and is quite a different ride than most Movies of the time, and it is framed with conviction and confidence showing us many Artistic and bizarre touches. The highly touted Dali sequence was unparalleled at the time and there is a rousing Music Score and attractive Actors and their is enough sexual symbolism that the audience can create a checklist for some fun. Overall, there is enough here for an entertaining diversion and it is a rather remarkable effort from all involved and it is an example why a Hitchcock Film is not like anything else. It is a wonder.

    Hitchcock marshaled some strong forces for this dark exploration of the psyche, with A-list leads in Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, plus crack writer Ben Hecht and perhaps most famously Surrealist artist Salvador Dali to create Peck's defining dream sequence. It's still Hitchcock's film though. And a very watchable one at that. It has its faults, with almost every scene carrying some expository message, none more so than when Bergman's psychiatric nurse pieces together not only how the real Dr Edwardes' was murdered but where and by whom, glaring plot-gaps plus it just has too many words, but helped along by some typically stylish direction from the Master, with some memorable set-pieces along the way, it's still a reasonably gripping and exciting noir-esque movie. No matter that Peck and Bergman don't seem right for their parts, they play out the fantastic plot with conviction and almost have you think they mean it while U.N.C.L.E.'s Mr Waverley Leo G Carroll is excellent as the displaced hospital governor. As for those set-pieces, nothing outdoes Dali's memorable sequence containing many of his artistic talismen, such as soft constructions, masked figures and eerie landscapes, but Hitch gets in his tuppenceworth too with Bergman's doors-opening first kiss, another suspense-ful drink of milk (after "Suspicion") and the subjective finishing shot (literally) which must have blown away (again, literally) its original audience. However there are also many less showy, subtle touches with unusual camera angles and fluid camera movements sewn seamlessly into the whole. To make implausible material like this work takes no little skill and Hitchcock does a grand job in taking his audience along with him, leaving them if not exactly spellbound, then certainly entertained.

    First, the music background was outstanding. I thought Ingrid's character as Constance unbelievable on a couple of occasions...her falling in love with the patient...and the scene where she is confronting the real murderer as nonchantly as having tea with a visitor. She showed no fear as she was accusing him of murder. Why didn't she call the police and accuse him in front of them, for safety sake. Not Ingrid's fault, bad written script. Now, for that Ski scene...it was so badly photographed with her suspecting glances at Peck as they supposedly going at fast speed. Nothing was ever mentioned in their previous skiing experiences. Phony as that scene was to me, they looked like Pros..if that was their first time on Ski's.

    I honestly expected to be a little spellbound by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 mystery Spellbound given that they are some talented talents behind it. I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work, I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately, such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as Spellbound. In the film, we follow a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director (Gregory Peck) of the hospital, but fairly soon, she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition, she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder, she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eye-catching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games, where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made Spellbound as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well, my problem with Spellbound can be summarized as such: it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film, that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement, because of its uninspiring direction, because of its lame script, and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.

    Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations with producer David O. Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works. With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man. While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock, meanwhile, hated hiring Peck, but Selznick kept saddling the director with him; Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money. The film sports a now famous "dream sequence". It was designed by Salvador Dali, the famous surrealist, but directed by William Cameron Menzies, a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of "art director" and "production designer", Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealist/expressionist "Invaders From Mars". He was also responsible for a number of pioneering, early special effects, and as art director was responsible for the overall "look" of a number of famous films, most notably "Gone With the Wind", which he storyboarded, colour co-ordinated and co directed. "Spellbound's" dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long, but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird; Hitchcock was himself, reportedly, ornithophobic. Like most of Hitchcock's films, our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage; feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego, she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud, for example, the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought, and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy "dream reading". In Hitchcock's hands, psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions. In Jean-Luc Godard's mammoth "Histoire(s) du cinema", there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch, Godard essentially says, is less about content than "decor"; bits of scenery, camera work, clothing, props and moments. You see that with "Spellbound". What you remember are various fragments: powerful point-of-view shots, a subjective shot of a character drinking milk, snow-capped streets, and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence. Upon release, "Spellbound" was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler, tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism, but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching. Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont.

At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff. Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!") Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

    Spellbound: One heck of a solid picture, but unfortunately, Spellbound only sets its sights in the middle of my radar and never reaches for anything higher. It's satisfied with being satisfactory. Bergman is dependable with her acting here, but Gregory Peck is the real star in my opinion. It's either a hit or miss performance; for me, he gave an arresting performance. Michael Chekhov is lively in his supporting role, too. Hitchcock doesn't attack the material, almost like his focus wasn't there the entire time, but he doesn't do anything wrong. The film's strongest area is the score; the dramatic music echoes the motivations of the characters. The twisty ending is a nice way to conclude the picture. Spellbound is good, but no where near great. It's uncanny to me that Hitchcock was nominated for his work here, but not for Vertigo, The Birds, or any other wonderful work. Rating: B+ Grade: 7.5/10

    There are three good things about "Spellbound": a gorgeous young Gregory Peck, a memorable dream sequence and the kind of killer supporting performances that deprives the lead roles from their last bits of believability, whether Michael Chekov as the scene-stealing Dr. Tchekov or Leo G. Carrel as the enigmatic Doctor I-forgot-his-name. The rest is typical Hitchcock, which is not to diminish the film's merit but not saying much either. Like I said in the title, the film is like an "Inception" made in the 40's, using all Christopher Nolan's darlings: a mystery, a psychological thriller and naturally, a romance as the driving subplot. Wouldn't we, after all, expect a love at first sight, between two of the most attractive stars of the 40's: Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck? Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a cold and emotionless psychiatrist who works in Green Manors institute. This is how her character is set-up anyway, with her glasses and snobbish attitude, she stands on a symbolical pedestal, constantly -allow me the word- erected by her colleagues' seductive moves. Who'd blame them? she's the only female of the staff, and not the least. Granted Hitchcock is not the most subtle director when it comes to romance, it's still frustrating to see the distinguished Constance Petersen turn into an enamored teenager as soon as the institute's new Head makes his entrance, but who'd blame her either? It's Gregory Peck for cinematic Gods' sake! Peck as gorgeous as ever, and his beauty is so distracting (should I specify I'm a straight male) that you forgive all the little flaws on the characterization department, and gosh, there are some! Peck as Dr. Edwards strikes as too young a man, much more, there's something in his eyes obviously betraying a hidden trauma. His first dinner with the staff provides the first hints: all it takes for Petersen is to draw some lines with a fork on the tablecloth to hit a sensitive chord in Peck, who suddenly becomes more aggressive. The mystery picks up and Edwards turns into an intriguing subject for Constance  it's up to us to wonder whether it's for professional psychoanalysis or something else tickling her body. Sinning again with obviousness, it doesn't take much time before the second incident occurs and reveals an unconcealed wound in Peck, a trauma that nourished a guilt complex with subsequent amnesia, something medically typical; take the word from the experts. Later, Constance discovers that the playboy is not the real Edwards, who mysteriously disappeared, and she can't (or doesn't want to) believe the impostor who claims to have murdered the doctor. Naturally, we don't believe it either, which lessens the intensity of the mystery, since when something is too obvious to the point of being claimed several times, we know the psychoanalysis is meant to clear the doubts, so Petersen finally allows herself to love her patient. "Spellbound" acknowledges its tribute to the virtues of psychoanalysis, the treatment of Freud's discipline is rather rudimentary, but it does provide an interesting touch of surrealism notably through the iconic dream sequence. "Spellbound" is renowned for the dream part, designed by Salvador Dali himself. And those who saw "Un Chien Andalou" will immediately recognize a wink to the infamous eye-cutting moment of Bunuel's masterpiece. The sequence lasted more than twenty minutes but the original cut severely shortened it, only leaving the hints that could be associated with Edwards' murder. "Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective. Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor. I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect. Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.

    A female psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) protects the identity of an amnesia patient (Gregory Peck) accused of murder while attempting to recover his memory. This is a very special kind of mystery. Not only do we have to figure out whether or not the accused was actually guilty of the crime, but we have to work through his issues of why he has blocked the incident out. Will his remembering exonerate him? Or is he only building a case against himself? I watched this solely because it was recommended for the Salvador Dali dream sequence. Actually, the film as a whole is excellent. The sequence, known for the eyes, is not the most interesting part.

    Psychoanalysis made its way onto the screen many times and certainly in the early days, Hollywood hardly ever achieved anything worth much. Film-Noir was a common Genre that ventured in and out of this World, but even there where much is forbidden the elusive Practice and descriptions of Psychiatry were forever searching for expository verbiage and most of the time it was rendered ridiculous and pedestrian. Even with masters like Hitchcock and Writer Ben Hecht it was a discipline that defied explanatory sentences and were much too deep to be believed in short Scenes or even whole Movies. The hopelessly dated stuff like "Guilt Complex", here the term used over and over, is just is too simple to explain the complexities of the mind and the relation to the plot. The Dream analysis is also contrived to the point that it surrenders all believability. So this Film that so seriously tries to make it all fit and function as steps and paths for the Story to unfold is pathetically forced and can be too much to sustain. There is enough here to be interesting and is quite a different ride than most Movies of the time, and it is framed with conviction and confidence showing us many Artistic and bizarre touches. The highly touted Dali sequence was unparalleled at the time and there is a rousing Music Score and attractive Actors and their is enough sexual symbolism that the audience can create a checklist for some fun. Overall, there is enough here for an entertaining diversion and it is a rather remarkable effort from all involved and it is an example why a Hitchcock Film is not like anything else. It is a wonder.

    Hitchcock marshaled some strong forces for this dark exploration of the psyche, with A-list leads in Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, plus crack writer Ben Hecht and perhaps most famously Surrealist artist Salvador Dali to create Peck's defining dream sequence. It's still Hitchcock's film though. And a very watchable one at that. It has its faults, with almost every scene carrying some expository message, none more so than when Bergman's psychiatric nurse pieces together not only how the real Dr Edwardes' was murdered but where and by whom, glaring plot-gaps plus it just has too many words, but helped along by some typically stylish direction from the Master, with some memorable set-pieces along the way, it's still a reasonably gripping and exciting noir-esque movie. No matter that Peck and Bergman don't seem right for their parts, they play out the fantastic plot with conviction and almost have you think they mean it while U.N.C.L.E.'s Mr Waverley Leo G Carroll is excellent as the displaced hospital governor. As for those set-pieces, nothing outdoes Dali's memorable sequence containing many of his artistic talismen, such as soft constructions, masked figures and eerie landscapes, but Hitch gets in his tuppenceworth too with Bergman's doors-opening first kiss, another suspense-ful drink of milk (after "Suspicion") and the subjective finishing shot (literally) which must have blown away (again, literally) its original audience. However there are also many less showy, subtle touches with unusual camera angles and fluid camera movements sewn seamlessly into the whole. To make implausible material like this work takes no little skill and Hitchcock does a grand job in taking his audience along with him, leaving them if not exactly spellbound, then certainly entertained.

    First, the music background was outstanding. I thought Ingrid's character as Constance unbelievable on a couple of occasions...her falling in love with the patient...and the scene where she is confronting the real murderer as nonchantly as having tea with a visitor. She showed no fear as she was accusing him of murder. Why didn't she call the police and accuse him in front of them, for safety sake. Not Ingrid's fault, bad written script. Now, for that Ski scene...it was so badly photographed with her suspecting glances at Peck as they supposedly going at fast speed. Nothing was ever mentioned in their previous skiing experiences. Phony as that scene was to me, they looked like Pros..if that was their first time on Ski's.

    I honestly expected to be a little spellbound by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 mystery Spellbound given that they are some talented talents behind it. I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work, I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately, such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as Spellbound. In the film, we follow a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director (Gregory Peck) of the hospital, but fairly soon, she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition, she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder, she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eye-catching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games, where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made Spellbound as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well, my problem with Spellbound can be summarized as such: it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film, that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement, because of its uninspiring direction, because of its lame script, and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.

    Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations with producer David O. Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works. With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man. While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock, meanwhile, hated hiring Peck, but Selznick kept saddling the director with him; Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money. The film sports a now famous "dream sequence". It was designed by Salvador Dali, the famous surrealist, but directed by William Cameron Menzies, a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of "art director" and "production designer", Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealist/expressionist "Invaders From Mars". He was also responsible for a number of pioneering, early special effects, and as art director was responsible for the overall "look" of a number of famous films, most notably "Gone With the Wind", which he storyboarded, colour co-ordinated and co directed. "Spellbound's" dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long, but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird; Hitchcock was himself, reportedly, ornithophobic. Like most of Hitchcock's films, our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage; feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego, she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud, for example, the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought, and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy "dream reading". In Hitchcock's hands, psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions. In Jean-Luc Godard's mammoth "Histoire(s) du cinema", there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch, Godard essentially says, is less about content than "decor"; bits of scenery, camera work, clothing, props and moments. You see that with "Spellbound". What you remember are various fragments: powerful point-of-view shots, a subjective shot of a character drinking milk, snow-capped streets, and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence. Upon release, "Spellbound" was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler, tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism, but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    Spellbound is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a really impressive cast that all play their characters with great heart and passion.It definitely wasn't what I was expecting it to be,mostly because its directed by Alfred Hitchcock,its suppose to be a thriller but I wasn't very thrilled,I thought the story was really good,but it just wasn't that exciting,and a story like that sounds like they could have made it a lot more mysterious and strange.The best part of the movie was without a doubt the music,which it won an Academy Award for and it really deserved it,the music is truly outstanding and you will have it stuck in your head long after he movie ends.Fans f Alfred Hitchcock shouldn't expect a lot of thrills from Spellbound,but Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck still make it enjoyable. A female psychiatrist falls in love with her amnesiac patient although she is aware he may be a killer.

    There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching. Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont. She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk. Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's "women's pictures," and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation. Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word: "Liverwurst." Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch. A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like: "We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes," you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had. Much of "Spellbound" feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dal&iacute; is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. ("I hate men. I loathe them.") There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dal&iacute;, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open. Constance's diagnosis of "Edwardes" problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely "a trick of the mind for staying sane"? At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff. Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!") Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

"Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective. Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor. I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect. Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.

    A female psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) protects the identity of an amnesia patient (Gregory Peck) accused of murder while attempting to recover his memory. This is a very special kind of mystery. Not only do we have to figure out whether or not the accused was actually guilty of the crime, but we have to work through his issues of why he has blocked the incident out. Will his remembering exonerate him? Or is he only building a case against himself? I watched this solely because it was recommended for the Salvador Dali dream sequence. Actually, the film as a whole is excellent. The sequence, known for the eyes, is not the most interesting part.

    Psychoanalysis made its way onto the screen many times and certainly in the early days, Hollywood hardly ever achieved anything worth much. Film-Noir was a common Genre that ventured in and out of this World, but even there where much is forbidden the elusive Practice and descriptions of Psychiatry were forever searching for expository verbiage and most of the time it was rendered ridiculous and pedestrian. Even with masters like Hitchcock and Writer Ben Hecht it was a discipline that defied explanatory sentences and were much too deep to be believed in short Scenes or even whole Movies. The hopelessly dated stuff like "Guilt Complex", here the term used over and over, is just is too simple to explain the complexities of the mind and the relation to the plot. The Dream analysis is also contrived to the point that it surrenders all believability. So this Film that so seriously tries to make it all fit and function as steps and paths for the Story to unfold is pathetically forced and can be too much to sustain. There is enough here to be interesting and is quite a different ride than most Movies of the time, and it is framed with conviction and confidence showing us many Artistic and bizarre touches. The highly touted Dali sequence was unparalleled at the time and there is a rousing Music Score and attractive Actors and their is enough sexual symbolism that the audience can create a checklist for some fun. Overall, there is enough here for an entertaining diversion and it is a rather remarkable effort from all involved and it is an example why a Hitchcock Film is not like anything else. It is a wonder.

    Hitchcock marshaled some strong forces for this dark exploration of the psyche, with A-list leads in Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, plus crack writer Ben Hecht and perhaps most famously Surrealist artist Salvador Dali to create Peck's defining dream sequence. It's still Hitchcock's film though. And a very watchable one at that. It has its faults, with almost every scene carrying some expository message, none more so than when Bergman's psychiatric nurse pieces together not only how the real Dr Edwardes' was murdered but where and by whom, glaring plot-gaps plus it just has too many words, but helped along by some typically stylish direction from the Master, with some memorable set-pieces along the way, it's still a reasonably gripping and exciting noir-esque movie. No matter that Peck and Bergman don't seem right for their parts, they play out the fantastic plot with conviction and almost have you think they mean it while U.N.C.L.E.'s Mr Waverley Leo G Carroll is excellent as the displaced hospital governor. As for those set-pieces, nothing outdoes Dali's memorable sequence containing many of his artistic talismen, such as soft constructions, masked figures and eerie landscapes, but Hitch gets in his tuppenceworth too with Bergman's doors-opening first kiss, another suspense-ful drink of milk (after "Suspicion") and the subjective finishing shot (literally) which must have blown away (again, literally) its original audience. However there are also many less showy, subtle touches with unusual camera angles and fluid camera movements sewn seamlessly into the whole. To make implausible material like this work takes no little skill and Hitchcock does a grand job in taking his audience along with him, leaving them if not exactly spellbound, then certainly entertained.

    First, the music background was outstanding. I thought Ingrid's character as Constance unbelievable on a couple of occasions...her falling in love with the patient...and the scene where she is confronting the real murderer as nonchantly as having tea with a visitor. She showed no fear as she was accusing him of murder. Why didn't she call the police and accuse him in front of them, for safety sake. Not Ingrid's fault, bad written script. Now, for that Ski scene...it was so badly photographed with her suspecting glances at Peck as they supposedly going at fast speed. Nothing was ever mentioned in their previous skiing experiences. Phony as that scene was to me, they looked like Pros..if that was their first time on Ski's.

    I honestly expected to be a little spellbound by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 mystery Spellbound given that they are some talented talents behind it. I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work, I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately, such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as Spellbound. In the film, we follow a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director (Gregory Peck) of the hospital, but fairly soon, she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition, she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder, she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eye-catching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games, where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made Spellbound as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well, my problem with Spellbound can be summarized as such: it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film, that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement, because of its uninspiring direction, because of its lame script, and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.

    Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations with producer David O. Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works. With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man. While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock, meanwhile, hated hiring Peck, but Selznick kept saddling the director with him; Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money. The film sports a now famous "dream sequence". It was designed by Salvador Dali, the famous surrealist, but directed by William Cameron Menzies, a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of "art director" and "production designer", Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealist/expressionist "Invaders From Mars". He was also responsible for a number of pioneering, early special effects, and as art director was responsible for the overall "look" of a number of famous films, most notably "Gone With the Wind", which he storyboarded, colour co-ordinated and co directed. "Spellbound's" dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long, but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird; Hitchcock was himself, reportedly, ornithophobic. Like most of Hitchcock's films, our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage; feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego, she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud, for example, the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought, and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy "dream reading". In Hitchcock's hands, psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions. In Jean-Luc Godard's mammoth "Histoire(s) du cinema", there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch, Godard essentially says, is less about content than "decor"; bits of scenery, camera work, clothing, props and moments. You see that with "Spellbound". What you remember are various fragments: powerful point-of-view shots, a subjective shot of a character drinking milk, snow-capped streets, and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence. Upon release, "Spellbound" was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler, tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism, but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    Spellbound is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a really impressive cast that all play their characters with great heart and passion.It definitely wasn't what I was expecting it to be,mostly because its directed by Alfred Hitchcock,its suppose to be a thriller but I wasn't very thrilled,I thought the story was really good,but it just wasn't that exciting,and a story like that sounds like they could have made it a lot more mysterious and strange.The best part of the movie was without a doubt the music,which it won an Academy Award for and it really deserved it,the music is truly outstanding and you will have it stuck in your head long after he movie ends.Fans f Alfred Hitchcock shouldn't expect a lot of thrills from Spellbound,but Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck still make it enjoyable. A female psychiatrist falls in love with her amnesiac patient although she is aware he may be a killer.

    There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching. Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont. She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk. Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's "women's pictures," and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation. Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word: "Liverwurst." Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch. A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like: "We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes," you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had. Much of "Spellbound" feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dal&iacute; is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. ("I hate men. I loathe them.") There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dal&iacute;, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open. Constance's diagnosis of "Edwardes" problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely "a trick of the mind for staying sane"? At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff. Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!") Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

    Spellbound: One heck of a solid picture, but unfortunately, Spellbound only sets its sights in the middle of my radar and never reaches for anything higher. It's satisfied with being satisfactory. Bergman is dependable with her acting here, but Gregory Peck is the real star in my opinion. It's either a hit or miss performance; for me, he gave an arresting performance. Michael Chekhov is lively in his supporting role, too. Hitchcock doesn't attack the material, almost like his focus wasn't there the entire time, but he doesn't do anything wrong. The film's strongest area is the score; the dramatic music echoes the motivations of the characters. The twisty ending is a nice way to conclude the picture. Spellbound is good, but no where near great. It's uncanny to me that Hitchcock was nominated for his work here, but not for Vertigo, The Birds, or any other wonderful work. Rating: B+ Grade: 7.5/10

    There are three good things about "Spellbound": a gorgeous young Gregory Peck, a memorable dream sequence and the kind of killer supporting performances that deprives the lead roles from their last bits of believability, whether Michael Chekov as the scene-stealing Dr. Tchekov or Leo G. Carrel as the enigmatic Doctor I-forgot-his-name. The rest is typical Hitchcock, which is not to diminish the film's merit but not saying much either. Like I said in the title, the film is like an "Inception" made in the 40's, using all Christopher Nolan's darlings: a mystery, a psychological thriller and naturally, a romance as the driving subplot. Wouldn't we, after all, expect a love at first sight, between two of the most attractive stars of the 40's: Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck? Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a cold and emotionless psychiatrist who works in Green Manors institute. This is how her character is set-up anyway, with her glasses and snobbish attitude, she stands on a symbolical pedestal, constantly -allow me the word- erected by her colleagues' seductive moves. Who'd blame them? she's the only female of the staff, and not the least. Granted Hitchcock is not the most subtle director when it comes to romance, it's still frustrating to see the distinguished Constance Petersen turn into an enamored teenager as soon as the institute's new Head makes his entrance, but who'd blame her either? It's Gregory Peck for cinematic Gods' sake! Peck as gorgeous as ever, and his beauty is so distracting (should I specify I'm a straight male) that you forgive all the little flaws on the characterization department, and gosh, there are some! Peck as Dr. Edwards strikes as too young a man, much more, there's something in his eyes obviously betraying a hidden trauma. His first dinner with the staff provides the first hints: all it takes for Petersen is to draw some lines with a fork on the tablecloth to hit a sensitive chord in Peck, who suddenly becomes more aggressive. The mystery picks up and Edwards turns into an intriguing subject for Constance  it's up to us to wonder whether it's for professional psychoanalysis or something else tickling her body. Sinning again with obviousness, it doesn't take much time before the second incident occurs and reveals an unconcealed wound in Peck, a trauma that nourished a guilt complex with subsequent amnesia, something medically typical; take the word from the experts. Later, Constance discovers that the playboy is not the real Edwards, who mysteriously disappeared, and she can't (or doesn't want to) believe the impostor who claims to have murdered the doctor. Naturally, we don't believe it either, which lessens the intensity of the mystery, since when something is too obvious to the point of being claimed several times, we know the psychoanalysis is meant to clear the doubts, so Petersen finally allows herself to love her patient. "Spellbound" acknowledges its tribute to the virtues of psychoanalysis, the treatment of Freud's discipline is rather rudimentary, but it does provide an interesting touch of surrealism notably through the iconic dream sequence. "Spellbound" is renowned for the dream part, designed by Salvador Dali himself. And those who saw "Un Chien Andalou" will immediately recognize a wink to the infamous eye-cutting moment of Bunuel's masterpiece. The sequence lasted more than twenty minutes but the original cut severely shortened it, only leaving the hints that could be associated with Edwards' murder. "Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective. Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor. I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect. Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.

As for those set-pieces, nothing outdoes Dali's memorable sequence containing many of his artistic talismen, such as soft constructions, masked figures and eerie landscapes, but Hitch gets in his tuppenceworth too with Bergman's doors-opening first kiss, another suspense-ful drink of milk (after "Suspicion") and the subjective finishing shot (literally) which must have blown away (again, literally) its original audience. However there are also many less showy, subtle touches with unusual camera angles and fluid camera movements sewn seamlessly into the whole. To make implausible material like this work takes no little skill and Hitchcock does a grand job in taking his audience along with him, leaving them if not exactly spellbound, then certainly entertained.

    First, the music background was outstanding. I thought Ingrid's character as Constance unbelievable on a couple of occasions...her falling in love with the patient...and the scene where she is confronting the real murderer as nonchantly as having tea with a visitor. She showed no fear as she was accusing him of murder. Why didn't she call the police and accuse him in front of them, for safety sake. Not Ingrid's fault, bad written script. Now, for that Ski scene...it was so badly photographed with her suspecting glances at Peck as they supposedly going at fast speed. Nothing was ever mentioned in their previous skiing experiences. Phony as that scene was to me, they looked like Pros..if that was their first time on Ski's.

    I honestly expected to be a little spellbound by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 mystery Spellbound given that they are some talented talents behind it. I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work, I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately, such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as Spellbound. In the film, we follow a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director (Gregory Peck) of the hospital, but fairly soon, she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition, she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder, she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eye-catching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games, where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made Spellbound as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well, my problem with Spellbound can be summarized as such: it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film, that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement, because of its uninspiring direction, because of its lame script, and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.

    Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations with producer David O. Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works. With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man. While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock, meanwhile, hated hiring Peck, but Selznick kept saddling the director with him; Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money. The film sports a now famous "dream sequence". It was designed by Salvador Dali, the famous surrealist, but directed by William Cameron Menzies, a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of "art director" and "production designer", Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealist/expressionist "Invaders From Mars". He was also responsible for a number of pioneering, early special effects, and as art director was responsible for the overall "look" of a number of famous films, most notably "Gone With the Wind", which he storyboarded, colour co-ordinated and co directed. "Spellbound's" dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long, but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird; Hitchcock was himself, reportedly, ornithophobic. Like most of Hitchcock's films, our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage; feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego, she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud, for example, the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought, and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy "dream reading". In Hitchcock's hands, psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions. In Jean-Luc Godard's mammoth "Histoire(s) du cinema", there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch, Godard essentially says, is less about content than "decor"; bits of scenery, camera work, clothing, props and moments. You see that with "Spellbound". What you remember are various fragments: powerful point-of-view shots, a subjective shot of a character drinking milk, snow-capped streets, and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence. Upon release, "Spellbound" was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler, tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism, but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    Spellbound is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a really impressive cast that all play their characters with great heart and passion.It definitely wasn't what I was expecting it to be,mostly because its directed by Alfred Hitchcock,its suppose to be a thriller but I wasn't very thrilled,I thought the story was really good,but it just wasn't that exciting,and a story like that sounds like they could have made it a lot more mysterious and strange.The best part of the movie was without a doubt the music,which it won an Academy Award for and it really deserved it,the music is truly outstanding and you will have it stuck in your head long after he movie ends.Fans f Alfred Hitchcock shouldn't expect a lot of thrills from Spellbound,but Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck still make it enjoyable. A female psychiatrist falls in love with her amnesiac patient although she is aware he may be a killer.

    There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching. Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont. She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk. Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's "women's pictures," and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation. Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word: "Liverwurst." Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch. A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like: "We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes," you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had. Much of "Spellbound" feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dal&iacute; is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. ("I hate men. I loathe them.") There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dal&iacute;, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open. Constance's diagnosis of "Edwardes" problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely "a trick of the mind for staying sane"? At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff. Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!") Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

    Spellbound: One heck of a solid picture, but unfortunately, Spellbound only sets its sights in the middle of my radar and never reaches for anything higher. It's satisfied with being satisfactory. Bergman is dependable with her acting here, but Gregory Peck is the real star in my opinion. It's either a hit or miss performance; for me, he gave an arresting performance. Michael Chekhov is lively in his supporting role, too. Hitchcock doesn't attack the material, almost like his focus wasn't there the entire time, but he doesn't do anything wrong. The film's strongest area is the score; the dramatic music echoes the motivations of the characters. The twisty ending is a nice way to conclude the picture. Spellbound is good, but no where near great. It's uncanny to me that Hitchcock was nominated for his work here, but not for Vertigo, The Birds, or any other wonderful work. Rating: B+ Grade: 7.5/10

    There are three good things about "Spellbound": a gorgeous young Gregory Peck, a memorable dream sequence and the kind of killer supporting performances that deprives the lead roles from their last bits of believability, whether Michael Chekov as the scene-stealing Dr. Tchekov or Leo G. Carrel as the enigmatic Doctor I-forgot-his-name. The rest is typical Hitchcock, which is not to diminish the film's merit but not saying much either. Like I said in the title, the film is like an "Inception" made in the 40's, using all Christopher Nolan's darlings: a mystery, a psychological thriller and naturally, a romance as the driving subplot. Wouldn't we, after all, expect a love at first sight, between two of the most attractive stars of the 40's: Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck? Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a cold and emotionless psychiatrist who works in Green Manors institute. This is how her character is set-up anyway, with her glasses and snobbish attitude, she stands on a symbolical pedestal, constantly -allow me the word- erected by her colleagues' seductive moves. Who'd blame them? she's the only female of the staff, and not the least. Granted Hitchcock is not the most subtle director when it comes to romance, it's still frustrating to see the distinguished Constance Petersen turn into an enamored teenager as soon as the institute's new Head makes his entrance, but who'd blame her either? It's Gregory Peck for cinematic Gods' sake! Peck as gorgeous as ever, and his beauty is so distracting (should I specify I'm a straight male) that you forgive all the little flaws on the characterization department, and gosh, there are some! Peck as Dr. Edwards strikes as too young a man, much more, there's something in his eyes obviously betraying a hidden trauma. His first dinner with the staff provides the first hints: all it takes for Petersen is to draw some lines with a fork on the tablecloth to hit a sensitive chord in Peck, who suddenly becomes more aggressive. The mystery picks up and Edwards turns into an intriguing subject for Constance  it's up to us to wonder whether it's for professional psychoanalysis or something else tickling her body. Sinning again with obviousness, it doesn't take much time before the second incident occurs and reveals an unconcealed wound in Peck, a trauma that nourished a guilt complex with subsequent amnesia, something medically typical; take the word from the experts. Later, Constance discovers that the playboy is not the real Edwards, who mysteriously disappeared, and she can't (or doesn't want to) believe the impostor who claims to have murdered the doctor. Naturally, we don't believe it either, which lessens the intensity of the mystery, since when something is too obvious to the point of being claimed several times, we know the psychoanalysis is meant to clear the doubts, so Petersen finally allows herself to love her patient. "Spellbound" acknowledges its tribute to the virtues of psychoanalysis, the treatment of Freud's discipline is rather rudimentary, but it does provide an interesting touch of surrealism notably through the iconic dream sequence. "Spellbound" is renowned for the dream part, designed by Salvador Dali himself. And those who saw "Un Chien Andalou" will immediately recognize a wink to the infamous eye-cutting moment of Bunuel's masterpiece. The sequence lasted more than twenty minutes but the original cut severely shortened it, only leaving the hints that could be associated with Edwards' murder. "Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective. Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor. I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect. Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.

    A female psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) protects the identity of an amnesia patient (Gregory Peck) accused of murder while attempting to recover his memory. This is a very special kind of mystery. Not only do we have to figure out whether or not the accused was actually guilty of the crime, but we have to work through his issues of why he has blocked the incident out. Will his remembering exonerate him? Or is he only building a case against himself? I watched this solely because it was recommended for the Salvador Dali dream sequence. Actually, the film as a whole is excellent. The sequence, known for the eyes, is not the most interesting part.

    Psychoanalysis made its way onto the screen many times and certainly in the early days, Hollywood hardly ever achieved anything worth much. Film-Noir was a common Genre that ventured in and out of this World, but even there where much is forbidden the elusive Practice and descriptions of Psychiatry were forever searching for expository verbiage and most of the time it was rendered ridiculous and pedestrian. Even with masters like Hitchcock and Writer Ben Hecht it was a discipline that defied explanatory sentences and were much too deep to be believed in short Scenes or even whole Movies. The hopelessly dated stuff like "Guilt Complex", here the term used over and over, is just is too simple to explain the complexities of the mind and the relation to the plot. The Dream analysis is also contrived to the point that it surrenders all believability. So this Film that so seriously tries to make it all fit and function as steps and paths for the Story to unfold is pathetically forced and can be too much to sustain. There is enough here to be interesting and is quite a different ride than most Movies of the time, and it is framed with conviction and confidence showing us many Artistic and bizarre touches. The highly touted Dali sequence was unparalleled at the time and there is a rousing Music Score and attractive Actors and their is enough sexual symbolism that the audience can create a checklist for some fun. Overall, there is enough here for an entertaining diversion and it is a rather remarkable effort from all involved and it is an example why a Hitchcock Film is not like anything else. It is a wonder.

    Hitchcock marshaled some strong forces for this dark exploration of the psyche, with A-list leads in Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, plus crack writer Ben Hecht and perhaps most famously Surrealist artist Salvador Dali to create Peck's defining dream sequence. It's still Hitchcock's film though. And a very watchable one at that. It has its faults, with almost every scene carrying some expository message, none more so than when Bergman's psychiatric nurse pieces together not only how the real Dr Edwardes' was murdered but where and by whom, glaring plot-gaps plus it just has too many words, but helped along by some typically stylish direction from the Master, with some memorable set-pieces along the way, it's still a reasonably gripping and exciting noir-esque movie. No matter that Peck and Bergman don't seem right for their parts, they play out the fantastic plot with conviction and almost have you think they mean it while U.N.C.L.E.'s Mr Waverley Leo G Carroll is excellent as the displaced hospital governor. As for those set-pieces, nothing outdoes Dali's memorable sequence containing many of his artistic talismen, such as soft constructions, masked figures and eerie landscapes, but Hitch gets in his tuppenceworth too with Bergman's doors-opening first kiss, another suspense-ful drink of milk (after "Suspicion") and the subjective finishing shot (literally) which must have blown away (again, literally) its original audience. However there are also many less showy, subtle touches with unusual camera angles and fluid camera movements sewn seamlessly into the whole. To make implausible material like this work takes no little skill and Hitchcock does a grand job in taking his audience along with him, leaving them if not exactly spellbound, then certainly entertained.

Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works. With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man. While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock, meanwhile, hated hiring Peck, but Selznick kept saddling the director with him; Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money. The film sports a now famous "dream sequence". It was designed by Salvador Dali, the famous surrealist, but directed by William Cameron Menzies, a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of "art director" and "production designer", Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealist/expressionist "Invaders From Mars". He was also responsible for a number of pioneering, early special effects, and as art director was responsible for the overall "look" of a number of famous films, most notably "Gone With the Wind", which he storyboarded, colour co-ordinated and co directed. "Spellbound's" dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long, but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird; Hitchcock was himself, reportedly, ornithophobic. Like most of Hitchcock's films, our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage; feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego, she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud, for example, the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought, and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy "dream reading". In Hitchcock's hands, psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions. In Jean-Luc Godard's mammoth "Histoire(s) du cinema", there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch, Godard essentially says, is less about content than "decor"; bits of scenery, camera work, clothing, props and moments. You see that with "Spellbound". What you remember are various fragments: powerful point-of-view shots, a subjective shot of a character drinking milk, snow-capped streets, and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence. Upon release, "Spellbound" was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler, tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism, but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    Spellbound is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a really impressive cast that all play their characters with great heart and passion.It definitely wasn't what I was expecting it to be,mostly because its directed by Alfred Hitchcock,its suppose to be a thriller but I wasn't very thrilled,I thought the story was really good,but it just wasn't that exciting,and a story like that sounds like they could have made it a lot more mysterious and strange.The best part of the movie was without a doubt the music,which it won an Academy Award for and it really deserved it,the music is truly outstanding and you will have it stuck in your head long after he movie ends.Fans f Alfred Hitchcock shouldn't expect a lot of thrills from Spellbound,but Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck still make it enjoyable. A female psychiatrist falls in love with her amnesiac patient although she is aware he may be a killer.

    There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching. Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont. She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk. Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's "women's pictures," and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation. Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word: "Liverwurst." Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch. A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like: "We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes," you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had. Much of "Spellbound" feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dal&iacute; is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. ("I hate men. I loathe them.") There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dal&iacute;, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open. Constance's diagnosis of "Edwardes" problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely "a trick of the mind for staying sane"? At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff. Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!") Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

    Spellbound: One heck of a solid picture, but unfortunately, Spellbound only sets its sights in the middle of my radar and never reaches for anything higher. It's satisfied with being satisfactory. Bergman is dependable with her acting here, but Gregory Peck is the real star in my opinion. It's either a hit or miss performance; for me, he gave an arresting performance. Michael Chekhov is lively in his supporting role, too. Hitchcock doesn't attack the material, almost like his focus wasn't there the entire time, but he doesn't do anything wrong. The film's strongest area is the score; the dramatic music echoes the motivations of the characters. The twisty ending is a nice way to conclude the picture. Spellbound is good, but no where near great. It's uncanny to me that Hitchcock was nominated for his work here, but not for Vertigo, The Birds, or any other wonderful work. Rating: B+ Grade: 7.5/10

    There are three good things about "Spellbound": a gorgeous young Gregory Peck, a memorable dream sequence and the kind of killer supporting performances that deprives the lead roles from their last bits of believability, whether Michael Chekov as the scene-stealing Dr. Tchekov or Leo G. Carrel as the enigmatic Doctor I-forgot-his-name. The rest is typical Hitchcock, which is not to diminish the film's merit but not saying much either. Like I said in the title, the film is like an "Inception" made in the 40's, using all Christopher Nolan's darlings: a mystery, a psychological thriller and naturally, a romance as the driving subplot. Wouldn't we, after all, expect a love at first sight, between two of the most attractive stars of the 40's: Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck? Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a cold and emotionless psychiatrist who works in Green Manors institute. This is how her character is set-up anyway, with her glasses and snobbish attitude, she stands on a symbolical pedestal, constantly -allow me the word- erected by her colleagues' seductive moves. Who'd blame them? she's the only female of the staff, and not the least. Granted Hitchcock is not the most subtle director when it comes to romance, it's still frustrating to see the distinguished Constance Petersen turn into an enamored teenager as soon as the institute's new Head makes his entrance, but who'd blame her either? It's Gregory Peck for cinematic Gods' sake! Peck as gorgeous as ever, and his beauty is so distracting (should I specify I'm a straight male) that you forgive all the little flaws on the characterization department, and gosh, there are some! Peck as Dr. Edwards strikes as too young a man, much more, there's something in his eyes obviously betraying a hidden trauma. His first dinner with the staff provides the first hints: all it takes for Petersen is to draw some lines with a fork on the tablecloth to hit a sensitive chord in Peck, who suddenly becomes more aggressive. The mystery picks up and Edwards turns into an intriguing subject for Constance  it's up to us to wonder whether it's for professional psychoanalysis or something else tickling her body. Sinning again with obviousness, it doesn't take much time before the second incident occurs and reveals an unconcealed wound in Peck, a trauma that nourished a guilt complex with subsequent amnesia, something medically typical; take the word from the experts. Later, Constance discovers that the playboy is not the real Edwards, who mysteriously disappeared, and she can't (or doesn't want to) believe the impostor who claims to have murdered the doctor. Naturally, we don't believe it either, which lessens the intensity of the mystery, since when something is too obvious to the point of being claimed several times, we know the psychoanalysis is meant to clear the doubts, so Petersen finally allows herself to love her patient. "Spellbound" acknowledges its tribute to the virtues of psychoanalysis, the treatment of Freud's discipline is rather rudimentary, but it does provide an interesting touch of surrealism notably through the iconic dream sequence. "Spellbound" is renowned for the dream part, designed by Salvador Dali himself. And those who saw "Un Chien Andalou" will immediately recognize a wink to the infamous eye-cutting moment of Bunuel's masterpiece. The sequence lasted more than twenty minutes but the original cut severely shortened it, only leaving the hints that could be associated with Edwards' murder. "Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective. Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor. I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect. Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.

    A female psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) protects the identity of an amnesia patient (Gregory Peck) accused of murder while attempting to recover his memory. This is a very special kind of mystery. Not only do we have to figure out whether or not the accused was actually guilty of the crime, but we have to work through his issues of why he has blocked the incident out. Will his remembering exonerate him? Or is he only building a case against himself? I watched this solely because it was recommended for the Salvador Dali dream sequence. Actually, the film as a whole is excellent. The sequence, known for the eyes, is not the most interesting part.

    Psychoanalysis made its way onto the screen many times and certainly in the early days, Hollywood hardly ever achieved anything worth much. Film-Noir was a common Genre that ventured in and out of this World, but even there where much is forbidden the elusive Practice and descriptions of Psychiatry were forever searching for expository verbiage and most of the time it was rendered ridiculous and pedestrian. Even with masters like Hitchcock and Writer Ben Hecht it was a discipline that defied explanatory sentences and were much too deep to be believed in short Scenes or even whole Movies. The hopelessly dated stuff like "Guilt Complex", here the term used over and over, is just is too simple to explain the complexities of the mind and the relation to the plot. The Dream analysis is also contrived to the point that it surrenders all believability. So this Film that so seriously tries to make it all fit and function as steps and paths for the Story to unfold is pathetically forced and can be too much to sustain. There is enough here to be interesting and is quite a different ride than most Movies of the time, and it is framed with conviction and confidence showing us many Artistic and bizarre touches. The highly touted Dali sequence was unparalleled at the time and there is a rousing Music Score and attractive Actors and their is enough sexual symbolism that the audience can create a checklist for some fun. Overall, there is enough here for an entertaining diversion and it is a rather remarkable effort from all involved and it is an example why a Hitchcock Film is not like anything else. It is a wonder.

    Hitchcock marshaled some strong forces for this dark exploration of the psyche, with A-list leads in Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, plus crack writer Ben Hecht and perhaps most famously Surrealist artist Salvador Dali to create Peck's defining dream sequence. It's still Hitchcock's film though. And a very watchable one at that. It has its faults, with almost every scene carrying some expository message, none more so than when Bergman's psychiatric nurse pieces together not only how the real Dr Edwardes' was murdered but where and by whom, glaring plot-gaps plus it just has too many words, but helped along by some typically stylish direction from the Master, with some memorable set-pieces along the way, it's still a reasonably gripping and exciting noir-esque movie. No matter that Peck and Bergman don't seem right for their parts, they play out the fantastic plot with conviction and almost have you think they mean it while U.N.C.L.E.'s Mr Waverley Leo G Carroll is excellent as the displaced hospital governor. As for those set-pieces, nothing outdoes Dali's memorable sequence containing many of his artistic talismen, such as soft constructions, masked figures and eerie landscapes, but Hitch gets in his tuppenceworth too with Bergman's doors-opening first kiss, another suspense-ful drink of milk (after "Suspicion") and the subjective finishing shot (literally) which must have blown away (again, literally) its original audience. However there are also many less showy, subtle touches with unusual camera angles and fluid camera movements sewn seamlessly into the whole. To make implausible material like this work takes no little skill and Hitchcock does a grand job in taking his audience along with him, leaving them if not exactly spellbound, then certainly entertained.

    First, the music background was outstanding. I thought Ingrid's character as Constance unbelievable on a couple of occasions...her falling in love with the patient...and the scene where she is confronting the real murderer as nonchantly as having tea with a visitor. She showed no fear as she was accusing him of murder. Why didn't she call the police and accuse him in front of them, for safety sake. Not Ingrid's fault, bad written script. Now, for that Ski scene...it was so badly photographed with her suspecting glances at Peck as they supposedly going at fast speed. Nothing was ever mentioned in their previous skiing experiences. Phony as that scene was to me, they looked like Pros..if that was their first time on Ski's.

    I honestly expected to be a little spellbound by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 mystery Spellbound given that they are some talented talents behind it. I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work, I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately, such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as Spellbound. In the film, we follow a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director (Gregory Peck) of the hospital, but fairly soon, she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition, she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder, she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eye-catching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games, where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made Spellbound as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well, my problem with Spellbound can be summarized as such: it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film, that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement, because of its uninspiring direction, because of its lame script, and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.

    Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations with producer David O. Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works. With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man. While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability.

    There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching. Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont. She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk. Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's "women's pictures," and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation. Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word: "Liverwurst." Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch. A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like: "We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes," you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had. Much of "Spellbound" feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dal&iacute; is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. ("I hate men. I loathe them.") There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dal&iacute;, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open. Constance's diagnosis of "Edwardes" problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely "a trick of the mind for staying sane"? At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff. Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!") Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

    Spellbound: One heck of a solid picture, but unfortunately, Spellbound only sets its sights in the middle of my radar and never reaches for anything higher. It's satisfied with being satisfactory. Bergman is dependable with her acting here, but Gregory Peck is the real star in my opinion. It's either a hit or miss performance; for me, he gave an arresting performance. Michael Chekhov is lively in his supporting role, too. Hitchcock doesn't attack the material, almost like his focus wasn't there the entire time, but he doesn't do anything wrong. The film's strongest area is the score; the dramatic music echoes the motivations of the characters. The twisty ending is a nice way to conclude the picture. Spellbound is good, but no where near great. It's uncanny to me that Hitchcock was nominated for his work here, but not for Vertigo, The Birds, or any other wonderful work. Rating: B+ Grade: 7.5/10

    There are three good things about "Spellbound": a gorgeous young Gregory Peck, a memorable dream sequence and the kind of killer supporting performances that deprives the lead roles from their last bits of believability, whether Michael Chekov as the scene-stealing Dr. Tchekov or Leo G. Carrel as the enigmatic Doctor I-forgot-his-name. The rest is typical Hitchcock, which is not to diminish the film's merit but not saying much either. Like I said in the title, the film is like an "Inception" made in the 40's, using all Christopher Nolan's darlings: a mystery, a psychological thriller and naturally, a romance as the driving subplot. Wouldn't we, after all, expect a love at first sight, between two of the most attractive stars of the 40's: Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck? Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a cold and emotionless psychiatrist who works in Green Manors institute. This is how her character is set-up anyway, with her glasses and snobbish attitude, she stands on a symbolical pedestal, constantly -allow me the word- erected by her colleagues' seductive moves. Who'd blame them? she's the only female of the staff, and not the least. Granted Hitchcock is not the most subtle director when it comes to romance, it's still frustrating to see the distinguished Constance Petersen turn into an enamored teenager as soon as the institute's new Head makes his entrance, but who'd blame her either? It's Gregory Peck for cinematic Gods' sake! Peck as gorgeous as ever, and his beauty is so distracting (should I specify I'm a straight male) that you forgive all the little flaws on the characterization department, and gosh, there are some! Peck as Dr. Edwards strikes as too young a man, much more, there's something in his eyes obviously betraying a hidden trauma. His first dinner with the staff provides the first hints: all it takes for Petersen is to draw some lines with a fork on the tablecloth to hit a sensitive chord in Peck, who suddenly becomes more aggressive. The mystery picks up and Edwards turns into an intriguing subject for Constance  it's up to us to wonder whether it's for professional psychoanalysis or something else tickling her body. Sinning again with obviousness, it doesn't take much time before the second incident occurs and reveals an unconcealed wound in Peck, a trauma that nourished a guilt complex with subsequent amnesia, something medically typical; take the word from the experts. Later, Constance discovers that the playboy is not the real Edwards, who mysteriously disappeared, and she can't (or doesn't want to) believe the impostor who claims to have murdered the doctor. Naturally, we don't believe it either, which lessens the intensity of the mystery, since when something is too obvious to the point of being claimed several times, we know the psychoanalysis is meant to clear the doubts, so Petersen finally allows herself to love her patient. "Spellbound" acknowledges its tribute to the virtues of psychoanalysis, the treatment of Freud's discipline is rather rudimentary, but it does provide an interesting touch of surrealism notably through the iconic dream sequence. "Spellbound" is renowned for the dream part, designed by Salvador Dali himself. And those who saw "Un Chien Andalou" will immediately recognize a wink to the infamous eye-cutting moment of Bunuel's masterpiece. The sequence lasted more than twenty minutes but the original cut severely shortened it, only leaving the hints that could be associated with Edwards' murder. "Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective. Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor. I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect. Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.

    A female psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) protects the identity of an amnesia patient (Gregory Peck) accused of murder while attempting to recover his memory. This is a very special kind of mystery. Not only do we have to figure out whether or not the accused was actually guilty of the crime, but we have to work through his issues of why he has blocked the incident out. Will his remembering exonerate him? Or is he only building a case against himself? I watched this solely because it was recommended for the Salvador Dali dream sequence. Actually, the film as a whole is excellent. The sequence, known for the eyes, is not the most interesting part.

    Psychoanalysis made its way onto the screen many times and certainly in the early days, Hollywood hardly ever achieved anything worth much. Film-Noir was a common Genre that ventured in and out of this World, but even there where much is forbidden the elusive Practice and descriptions of Psychiatry were forever searching for expository verbiage and most of the time it was rendered ridiculous and pedestrian. Even with masters like Hitchcock and Writer Ben Hecht it was a discipline that defied explanatory sentences and were much too deep to be believed in short Scenes or even whole Movies. The hopelessly dated stuff like "Guilt Complex", here the term used over and over, is just is too simple to explain the complexities of the mind and the relation to the plot. The Dream analysis is also contrived to the point that it surrenders all believability. So this Film that so seriously tries to make it all fit and function as steps and paths for the Story to unfold is pathetically forced and can be too much to sustain. There is enough here to be interesting and is quite a different ride than most Movies of the time, and it is framed with conviction and confidence showing us many Artistic and bizarre touches. The highly touted Dali sequence was unparalleled at the time and there is a rousing Music Score and attractive Actors and their is enough sexual symbolism that the audience can create a checklist for some fun. Overall, there is enough here for an entertaining diversion and it is a rather remarkable effort from all involved and it is an example why a Hitchcock Film is not like anything else. It is a wonder.

    Hitchcock marshaled some strong forces for this dark exploration of the psyche, with A-list leads in Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, plus crack writer Ben Hecht and perhaps most famously Surrealist artist Salvador Dali to create Peck's defining dream sequence. It's still Hitchcock's film though. And a very watchable one at that. It has its faults, with almost every scene carrying some expository message, none more so than when Bergman's psychiatric nurse pieces together not only how the real Dr Edwardes' was murdered but where and by whom, glaring plot-gaps plus it just has too many words, but helped along by some typically stylish direction from the Master, with some memorable set-pieces along the way, it's still a reasonably gripping and exciting noir-esque movie. No matter that Peck and Bergman don't seem right for their parts, they play out the fantastic plot with conviction and almost have you think they mean it while U.N.C.L.E.'s Mr Waverley Leo G Carroll is excellent as the displaced hospital governor. As for those set-pieces, nothing outdoes Dali's memorable sequence containing many of his artistic talismen, such as soft constructions, masked figures and eerie landscapes, but Hitch gets in his tuppenceworth too with Bergman's doors-opening first kiss, another suspense-ful drink of milk (after "Suspicion") and the subjective finishing shot (literally) which must have blown away (again, literally) its original audience. However there are also many less showy, subtle touches with unusual camera angles and fluid camera movements sewn seamlessly into the whole. To make implausible material like this work takes no little skill and Hitchcock does a grand job in taking his audience along with him, leaving them if not exactly spellbound, then certainly entertained.

    First, the music background was outstanding. I thought Ingrid's character as Constance unbelievable on a couple of occasions...her falling in love with the patient...and the scene where she is confronting the real murderer as nonchantly as having tea with a visitor. She showed no fear as she was accusing him of murder. Why didn't she call the police and accuse him in front of them, for safety sake. Not Ingrid's fault, bad written script. Now, for that Ski scene...it was so badly photographed with her suspecting glances at Peck as they supposedly going at fast speed. Nothing was ever mentioned in their previous skiing experiences. Phony as that scene was to me, they looked like Pros..if that was their first time on Ski's.

    I honestly expected to be a little spellbound by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 mystery Spellbound given that they are some talented talents behind it. I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work, I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately, such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as Spellbound. In the film, we follow a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director (Gregory Peck) of the hospital, but fairly soon, she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition, she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder, she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eye-catching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games, where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made Spellbound as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well, my problem with Spellbound can be summarized as such: it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film, that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement, because of its uninspiring direction, because of its lame script, and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.

    Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations with producer David O. Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works. With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man. While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock, meanwhile, hated hiring Peck, but Selznick kept saddling the director with him; Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money. The film sports a now famous "dream sequence". It was designed by Salvador Dali, the famous surrealist, but directed by William Cameron Menzies, a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of "art director" and "production designer", Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealist/expressionist "Invaders From Mars". He was also responsible for a number of pioneering, early special effects, and as art director was responsible for the overall "look" of a number of famous films, most notably "Gone With the Wind", which he storyboarded, colour co-ordinated and co directed. "Spellbound's" dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long, but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird; Hitchcock was himself, reportedly, ornithophobic. Like most of Hitchcock's films, our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage; feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego, she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud, for example, the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought, and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy "dream reading". In Hitchcock's hands, psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions. In Jean-Luc Godard's mammoth "Histoire(s) du cinema", there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch, Godard essentially says, is less about content than "decor"; bits of scenery, camera work, clothing, props and moments. You see that with "Spellbound". What you remember are various fragments: powerful point-of-view shots, a subjective shot of a character drinking milk, snow-capped streets, and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence. Upon release, "Spellbound" was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler, tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism, but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    Spellbound is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a really impressive cast that all play their characters with great heart and passion.It definitely wasn't what I was expecting it to be,mostly because its directed by Alfred Hitchcock,its suppose to be a thriller but I wasn't very thrilled,I thought the story was really good,but it just wasn't that exciting,and a story like that sounds like they could have made it a lot more mysterious and strange.The best part of the movie was without a doubt the music,which it won an Academy Award for and it really deserved it,the music is truly outstanding and you will have it stuck in your head long after he movie ends.Fans f Alfred Hitchcock shouldn't expect a lot of thrills from Spellbound,but Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck still make it enjoyable. A female psychiatrist falls in love with her amnesiac patient although she is aware he may be a killer.

    There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching. Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont. She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk. Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's "women's pictures," and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation. Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word: "Liverwurst." Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch. A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like: "We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes," you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had. Much of "Spellbound" feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dal&iacute; is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. ("I hate men. I loathe them.") There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dal&iacute;, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open. Constance's diagnosis of "Edwardes" problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely "a trick of the mind for staying sane"? At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff. Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!") Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

Peck as Dr. Edwards strikes as too young a man, much more, there's something in his eyes obviously betraying a hidden trauma. His first dinner with the staff provides the first hints: all it takes for Petersen is to draw some lines with a fork on the tablecloth to hit a sensitive chord in Peck, who suddenly becomes more aggressive. The mystery picks up and Edwards turns into an intriguing subject for Constance  it's up to us to wonder whether it's for professional psychoanalysis or something else tickling her body. Sinning again with obviousness, it doesn't take much time before the second incident occurs and reveals an unconcealed wound in Peck, a trauma that nourished a guilt complex with subsequent amnesia, something medically typical; take the word from the experts. Later, Constance discovers that the playboy is not the real Edwards, who mysteriously disappeared, and she can't (or doesn't want to) believe the impostor who claims to have murdered the doctor. Naturally, we don't believe it either, which lessens the intensity of the mystery, since when something is too obvious to the point of being claimed several times, we know the psychoanalysis is meant to clear the doubts, so Petersen finally allows herself to love her patient. "Spellbound" acknowledges its tribute to the virtues of psychoanalysis, the treatment of Freud's discipline is rather rudimentary, but it does provide an interesting touch of surrealism notably through the iconic dream sequence. "Spellbound" is renowned for the dream part, designed by Salvador Dali himself. And those who saw "Un Chien Andalou" will immediately recognize a wink to the infamous eye-cutting moment of Bunuel's masterpiece. The sequence lasted more than twenty minutes but the original cut severely shortened it, only leaving the hints that could be associated with Edwards' murder. "Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective. Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor. I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect. Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.

    A female psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) protects the identity of an amnesia patient (Gregory Peck) accused of murder while attempting to recover his memory. This is a very special kind of mystery. Not only do we have to figure out whether or not the accused was actually guilty of the crime, but we have to work through his issues of why he has blocked the incident out. Will his remembering exonerate him? Or is he only building a case against himself? I watched this solely because it was recommended for the Salvador Dali dream sequence. Actually, the film as a whole is excellent. The sequence, known for the eyes, is not the most interesting part.

    Psychoanalysis made its way onto the screen many times and certainly in the early days, Hollywood hardly ever achieved anything worth much. Film-Noir was a common Genre that ventured in and out of this World, but even there where much is forbidden the elusive Practice and descriptions of Psychiatry were forever searching for expository verbiage and most of the time it was rendered ridiculous and pedestrian. Even with masters like Hitchcock and Writer Ben Hecht it was a discipline that defied explanatory sentences and were much too deep to be believed in short Scenes or even whole Movies. The hopelessly dated stuff like "Guilt Complex", here the term used over and over, is just is too simple to explain the complexities of the mind and the relation to the plot. The Dream analysis is also contrived to the point that it surrenders all believability. So this Film that so seriously tries to make it all fit and function as steps and paths for the Story to unfold is pathetically forced and can be too much to sustain. There is enough here to be interesting and is quite a different ride than most Movies of the time, and it is framed with conviction and confidence showing us many Artistic and bizarre touches. The highly touted Dali sequence was unparalleled at the time and there is a rousing Music Score and attractive Actors and their is enough sexual symbolism that the audience can create a checklist for some fun. Overall, there is enough here for an entertaining diversion and it is a rather remarkable effort from all involved and it is an example why a Hitchcock Film is not like anything else. It is a wonder.

    Hitchcock marshaled some strong forces for this dark exploration of the psyche, with A-list leads in Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, plus crack writer Ben Hecht and perhaps most famously Surrealist artist Salvador Dali to create Peck's defining dream sequence. It's still Hitchcock's film though. And a very watchable one at that. It has its faults, with almost every scene carrying some expository message, none more so than when Bergman's psychiatric nurse pieces together not only how the real Dr Edwardes' was murdered but where and by whom, glaring plot-gaps plus it just has too many words, but helped along by some typically stylish direction from the Master, with some memorable set-pieces along the way, it's still a reasonably gripping and exciting noir-esque movie. No matter that Peck and Bergman don't seem right for their parts, they play out the fantastic plot with conviction and almost have you think they mean it while U.N.C.L.E.'s Mr Waverley Leo G Carroll is excellent as the displaced hospital governor. As for those set-pieces, nothing outdoes Dali's memorable sequence containing many of his artistic talismen, such as soft constructions, masked figures and eerie landscapes, but Hitch gets in his tuppenceworth too with Bergman's doors-opening first kiss, another suspense-ful drink of milk (after "Suspicion") and the subjective finishing shot (literally) which must have blown away (again, literally) its original audience. However there are also many less showy, subtle touches with unusual camera angles and fluid camera movements sewn seamlessly into the whole. To make implausible material like this work takes no little skill and Hitchcock does a grand job in taking his audience along with him, leaving them if not exactly spellbound, then certainly entertained.

    First, the music background was outstanding. I thought Ingrid's character as Constance unbelievable on a couple of occasions...her falling in love with the patient...and the scene where she is confronting the real murderer as nonchantly as having tea with a visitor. She showed no fear as she was accusing him of murder. Why didn't she call the police and accuse him in front of them, for safety sake. Not Ingrid's fault, bad written script. Now, for that Ski scene...it was so badly photographed with her suspecting glances at Peck as they supposedly going at fast speed. Nothing was ever mentioned in their previous skiing experiences. Phony as that scene was to me, they looked like Pros..if that was their first time on Ski's.

    I honestly expected to be a little spellbound by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 mystery Spellbound given that they are some talented talents behind it. I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work, I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately, such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as Spellbound. In the film, we follow a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director (Gregory Peck) of the hospital, but fairly soon, she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition, she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder, she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eye-catching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games, where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made Spellbound as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well, my problem with Spellbound can be summarized as such: it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film, that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement, because of its uninspiring direction, because of its lame script, and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.

    Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations with producer David O. Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works. With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man. While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock, meanwhile, hated hiring Peck, but Selznick kept saddling the director with him; Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money. The film sports a now famous "dream sequence". It was designed by Salvador Dali, the famous surrealist, but directed by William Cameron Menzies, a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of "art director" and "production designer", Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealist/expressionist "Invaders From Mars". He was also responsible for a number of pioneering, early special effects, and as art director was responsible for the overall "look" of a number of famous films, most notably "Gone With the Wind", which he storyboarded, colour co-ordinated and co directed. "Spellbound's" dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long, but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird; Hitchcock was himself, reportedly, ornithophobic. Like most of Hitchcock's films, our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage; feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego, she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud, for example, the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought, and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy "dream reading". In Hitchcock's hands, psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions. In Jean-Luc Godard's mammoth "Histoire(s) du cinema", there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch, Godard essentially says, is less about content than "decor"; bits of scenery, camera work, clothing, props and moments. You see that with "Spellbound". What you remember are various fragments: powerful point-of-view shots, a subjective shot of a character drinking milk, snow-capped streets, and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence. Upon release, "Spellbound" was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler, tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism, but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    Spellbound is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a really impressive cast that all play their characters with great heart and passion.It definitely wasn't what I was expecting it to be,mostly because its directed by Alfred Hitchcock,its suppose to be a thriller but I wasn't very thrilled,I thought the story was really good,but it just wasn't that exciting,and a story like that sounds like they could have made it a lot more mysterious and strange.The best part of the movie was without a doubt the music,which it won an Academy Award for and it really deserved it,the music is truly outstanding and you will have it stuck in your head long after he movie ends.Fans f Alfred Hitchcock shouldn't expect a lot of thrills from Spellbound,but Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck still make it enjoyable. A female psychiatrist falls in love with her amnesiac patient although she is aware he may be a killer.

    There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching. Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont. She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk. Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's "women's pictures," and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation. Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word: "Liverwurst." Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch. A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like: "We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes," you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had. Much of "Spellbound" feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dal&iacute; is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. ("I hate men. I loathe them.") There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dal&iacute;, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open. Constance's diagnosis of "Edwardes" problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely "a trick of the mind for staying sane"? At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff. Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!") Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

    Spellbound: One heck of a solid picture, but unfortunately, Spellbound only sets its sights in the middle of my radar and never reaches for anything higher. It's satisfied with being satisfactory. Bergman is dependable with her acting here, but Gregory Peck is the real star in my opinion. It's either a hit or miss performance; for me, he gave an arresting performance. Michael Chekhov is lively in his supporting role, too. Hitchcock doesn't attack the material, almost like his focus wasn't there the entire time, but he doesn't do anything wrong. The film's strongest area is the score; the dramatic music echoes the motivations of the characters. The twisty ending is a nice way to conclude the picture. Spellbound is good, but no where near great. It's uncanny to me that Hitchcock was nominated for his work here, but not for Vertigo, The Birds, or any other wonderful work. Rating: B+ Grade: 7.5/10

    There are three good things about "Spellbound": a gorgeous young Gregory Peck, a memorable dream sequence and the kind of killer supporting performances that deprives the lead roles from their last bits of believability, whether Michael Chekov as the scene-stealing Dr. Tchekov or Leo G. Carrel as the enigmatic Doctor I-forgot-his-name. The rest is typical Hitchcock, which is not to diminish the film's merit but not saying much either. Like I said in the title, the film is like an "Inception" made in the 40's, using all Christopher Nolan's darlings: a mystery, a psychological thriller and naturally, a romance as the driving subplot. Wouldn't we, after all, expect a love at first sight, between two of the most attractive stars of the 40's: Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck? Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a cold and emotionless psychiatrist who works in Green Manors institute. This is how her character is set-up anyway, with her glasses and snobbish attitude, she stands on a symbolical pedestal, constantly -allow me the word- erected by her colleagues' seductive moves. Who'd blame them? she's the only female of the staff, and not the least. Granted Hitchcock is not the most subtle director when it comes to romance, it's still frustrating to see the distinguished Constance Petersen turn into an enamored teenager as soon as the institute's new Head makes his entrance, but who'd blame her either? It's Gregory Peck for cinematic Gods' sake! Peck as gorgeous as ever, and his beauty is so distracting (should I specify I'm a straight male) that you forgive all the little flaws on the characterization department, and gosh, there are some! Peck as Dr. Edwards strikes as too young a man, much more, there's something in his eyes obviously betraying a hidden trauma. His first dinner with the staff provides the first hints: all it takes for Petersen is to draw some lines with a fork on the tablecloth to hit a sensitive chord in Peck, who suddenly becomes more aggressive. The mystery picks up and Edwards turns into an intriguing subject for Constance  it's up to us to wonder whether it's for professional psychoanalysis or something else tickling her body. Sinning again with obviousness, it doesn't take much time before the second incident occurs and reveals an unconcealed wound in Peck, a trauma that nourished a guilt complex with subsequent amnesia, something medically typical; take the word from the experts. Later, Constance discovers that the playboy is not the real Edwards, who mysteriously disappeared, and she can't (or doesn't want to) believe the impostor who claims to have murdered the doctor. Naturally, we don't believe it either, which lessens the intensity of the mystery, since when something is too obvious to the point of being claimed several times, we know the psychoanalysis is meant to clear the doubts, so Petersen finally allows herself to love her patient. "Spellbound" acknowledges its tribute to the virtues of psychoanalysis, the treatment of Freud's discipline is rather rudimentary, but it does provide an interesting touch of surrealism notably through the iconic dream sequence. "Spellbound" is renowned for the dream part, designed by Salvador Dali himself. And those who saw "Un Chien Andalou" will immediately recognize a wink to the infamous eye-cutting moment of Bunuel's masterpiece. The sequence lasted more than twenty minutes but the original cut severely shortened it, only leaving the hints that could be associated with Edwards' murder. "Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective. Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor. I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect. Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.

Overall, there is enough here for an entertaining diversion and it is a rather remarkable effort from all involved and it is an example why a Hitchcock Film is not like anything else. It is a wonder.

    Hitchcock marshaled some strong forces for this dark exploration of the psyche, with A-list leads in Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman, plus crack writer Ben Hecht and perhaps most famously Surrealist artist Salvador Dali to create Peck's defining dream sequence. It's still Hitchcock's film though. And a very watchable one at that. It has its faults, with almost every scene carrying some expository message, none more so than when Bergman's psychiatric nurse pieces together not only how the real Dr Edwardes' was murdered but where and by whom, glaring plot-gaps plus it just has too many words, but helped along by some typically stylish direction from the Master, with some memorable set-pieces along the way, it's still a reasonably gripping and exciting noir-esque movie. No matter that Peck and Bergman don't seem right for their parts, they play out the fantastic plot with conviction and almost have you think they mean it while U.N.C.L.E.'s Mr Waverley Leo G Carroll is excellent as the displaced hospital governor. As for those set-pieces, nothing outdoes Dali's memorable sequence containing many of his artistic talismen, such as soft constructions, masked figures and eerie landscapes, but Hitch gets in his tuppenceworth too with Bergman's doors-opening first kiss, another suspense-ful drink of milk (after "Suspicion") and the subjective finishing shot (literally) which must have blown away (again, literally) its original audience. However there are also many less showy, subtle touches with unusual camera angles and fluid camera movements sewn seamlessly into the whole. To make implausible material like this work takes no little skill and Hitchcock does a grand job in taking his audience along with him, leaving them if not exactly spellbound, then certainly entertained.

    First, the music background was outstanding. I thought Ingrid's character as Constance unbelievable on a couple of occasions...her falling in love with the patient...and the scene where she is confronting the real murderer as nonchantly as having tea with a visitor. She showed no fear as she was accusing him of murder. Why didn't she call the police and accuse him in front of them, for safety sake. Not Ingrid's fault, bad written script. Now, for that Ski scene...it was so badly photographed with her suspecting glances at Peck as they supposedly going at fast speed. Nothing was ever mentioned in their previous skiing experiences. Phony as that scene was to me, they looked like Pros..if that was their first time on Ski's.

    I honestly expected to be a little spellbound by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 mystery Spellbound given that they are some talented talents behind it. I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work, I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately, such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as Spellbound. In the film, we follow a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director (Gregory Peck) of the hospital, but fairly soon, she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition, she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder, she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eye-catching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games, where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made Spellbound as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well, my problem with Spellbound can be summarized as such: it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film, that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement, because of its uninspiring direction, because of its lame script, and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.

    Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations with producer David O. Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works. With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man. While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock, meanwhile, hated hiring Peck, but Selznick kept saddling the director with him; Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money. The film sports a now famous "dream sequence". It was designed by Salvador Dali, the famous surrealist, but directed by William Cameron Menzies, a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of "art director" and "production designer", Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealist/expressionist "Invaders From Mars". He was also responsible for a number of pioneering, early special effects, and as art director was responsible for the overall "look" of a number of famous films, most notably "Gone With the Wind", which he storyboarded, colour co-ordinated and co directed. "Spellbound's" dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long, but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird; Hitchcock was himself, reportedly, ornithophobic. Like most of Hitchcock's films, our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage; feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego, she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud, for example, the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought, and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy "dream reading". In Hitchcock's hands, psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions. In Jean-Luc Godard's mammoth "Histoire(s) du cinema", there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch, Godard essentially says, is less about content than "decor"; bits of scenery, camera work, clothing, props and moments. You see that with "Spellbound". What you remember are various fragments: powerful point-of-view shots, a subjective shot of a character drinking milk, snow-capped streets, and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence. Upon release, "Spellbound" was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler, tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism, but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    Spellbound is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a really impressive cast that all play their characters with great heart and passion.It definitely wasn't what I was expecting it to be,mostly because its directed by Alfred Hitchcock,its suppose to be a thriller but I wasn't very thrilled,I thought the story was really good,but it just wasn't that exciting,and a story like that sounds like they could have made it a lot more mysterious and strange.The best part of the movie was without a doubt the music,which it won an Academy Award for and it really deserved it,the music is truly outstanding and you will have it stuck in your head long after he movie ends.Fans f Alfred Hitchcock shouldn't expect a lot of thrills from Spellbound,but Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck still make it enjoyable. A female psychiatrist falls in love with her amnesiac patient although she is aware he may be a killer.

    There's much that's wrong with "Spellbound," but it has a way of keeping you watching. Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a resident analyst at Green Manors, a psychiatric institution in Vermont. She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk. Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's "women's pictures," and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation. Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word: "Liverwurst." Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch. A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like: "We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes," you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had. Much of "Spellbound" feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dal&iacute; is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. ("I hate men. I loathe them.") There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dal&iacute;, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open. Constance's diagnosis of "Edwardes" problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely "a trick of the mind for staying sane"? At some level, though, you can't attack "Spellbound" for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that "this whole thing is ridiculous," you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in "Star Wars." Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff. Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her "Miss Frozen Puss." Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines ("Will you love me just as much when I'm normal?" "If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!") Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. "I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad." Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

    Spellbound: One heck of a solid picture, but unfortunately, Spellbound only sets its sights in the middle of my radar and never reaches for anything higher. It's satisfied with being satisfactory. Bergman is dependable with her acting here, but Gregory Peck is the real star in my opinion. It's either a hit or miss performance; for me, he gave an arresting performance. Michael Chekhov is lively in his supporting role, too. Hitchcock doesn't attack the material, almost like his focus wasn't there the entire time, but he doesn't do anything wrong. The film's strongest area is the score; the dramatic music echoes the motivations of the characters. The twisty ending is a nice way to conclude the picture. Spellbound is good, but no where near great. It's uncanny to me that Hitchcock was nominated for his work here, but not for Vertigo, The Birds, or any other wonderful work. Rating: B+ Grade: 7.5/10

    There are three good things about "Spellbound": a gorgeous young Gregory Peck, a memorable dream sequence and the kind of killer supporting performances that deprives the lead roles from their last bits of believability, whether Michael Chekov as the scene-stealing Dr. Tchekov or Leo G. Carrel as the enigmatic Doctor I-forgot-his-name. The rest is typical Hitchcock, which is not to diminish the film's merit but not saying much either. Like I said in the title, the film is like an "Inception" made in the 40's, using all Christopher Nolan's darlings: a mystery, a psychological thriller and naturally, a romance as the driving subplot. Wouldn't we, after all, expect a love at first sight, between two of the most attractive stars of the 40's: Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck? Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a cold and emotionless psychiatrist who works in Green Manors institute. This is how her character is set-up anyway, with her glasses and snobbish attitude, she stands on a symbolical pedestal, constantly -allow me the word- erected by her colleagues' seductive moves. Who'd blame them? she's the only female of the staff, and not the least. Granted Hitchcock is not the most subtle director when it comes to romance, it's still frustrating to see the distinguished Constance Petersen turn into an enamored teenager as soon as the institute's new Head makes his entrance, but who'd blame her either? It's Gregory Peck for cinematic Gods' sake! Peck as gorgeous as ever, and his beauty is so distracting (should I specify I'm a straight male) that you forgive all the little flaws on the characterization department, and gosh, there are some! Peck as Dr. Edwards strikes as too young a man, much more, there's something in his eyes obviously betraying a hidden trauma. His first dinner with the staff provides the first hints: all it takes for Petersen is to draw some lines with a fork on the tablecloth to hit a sensitive chord in Peck, who suddenly becomes more aggressive. The mystery picks up and Edwards turns into an intriguing subject for Constance  it's up to us to wonder whether it's for professional psychoanalysis or something else tickling her body. Sinning again with obviousness, it doesn't take much time before the second incident occurs and reveals an unconcealed wound in Peck, a trauma that nourished a guilt complex with subsequent amnesia, something medically typical; take the word from the experts. Later, Constance discovers that the playboy is not the real Edwards, who mysteriously disappeared, and she can't (or doesn't want to) believe the impostor who claims to have murdered the doctor. Naturally, we don't believe it either, which lessens the intensity of the mystery, since when something is too obvious to the point of being claimed several times, we know the psychoanalysis is meant to clear the doubts, so Petersen finally allows herself to love her patient. "Spellbound" acknowledges its tribute to the virtues of psychoanalysis, the treatment of Freud's discipline is rather rudimentary, but it does provide an interesting touch of surrealism notably through the iconic dream sequence. "Spellbound" is renowned for the dream part, designed by Salvador Dali himself. And those who saw "Un Chien Andalou" will immediately recognize a wink to the infamous eye-cutting moment of Bunuel's masterpiece. The sequence lasted more than twenty minutes but the original cut severely shortened it, only leaving the hints that could be associated with Edwards' murder. "Spellbound" makes a good effort conveying the fact that our deepest torments and fears are hidden in our dreams, I, myself, had three of the most bizarre dreams last night, including me baby-sitting myself as a baby, and I wonder how a psychiatrist would interpret it. Nevertheless, the dream is the film's highlight, even more because it's cleverly used by Hitchcock to deliver some of the keys of the mystery. As a surrealist thriller, "Spellbound" has a way of itself to grab our attention and can be strangely effective. Finally, there's the performance of Michael Chekov earning him a deserved Oscar-nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Chekov allows us to be more magnanimous toward Bergman and Peck, not that they weren't good, but this is not Bergman from "Gaslight" or Peck from "Gentlemen's Agreement", both are diluted in two-dimensional personalities, as professional doctors with facades that don't fool us. We're as sure of Peck's innocence than Bergman's capability of emotions, their performances are quite bland and lack this extra spice that could have been induced by the suspicion on Peck's guilt. This is why one of the few powerful moments of "Spellbound" still involves Chekov, when he gives a glass of milk to Edwards, letting us wondering what kind of reaction it will inspire to a man traumatized by whiteness and holding a razor. I guess I'm only severe with "Spellbound" because it had the right ingredients of a great psychological thriller but didn't make much of them. The mystery around Peck was interesting, but the real thrills came from the last confrontation between Bergman and Carrell in one of the most sumptuous Hitchcockian climaxes, proving that he's still the Master of Suspense through the fantastic shot of a pointing revolver on Bergman becoming a sitting duck from the gun's perspective, and the conclusion which pays a magnificent tribute to "The Great Train Robbbery", with probably the same shocking effect. Now, did we learn that much about psychiatry or Freud? I don't think so, but the film is fair in its approach of a science that was still new and revolutionary at that time. "Spellbound" is not the most spell-binding of all Hitchcock's films and the tag-line "will he kiss or kill me" seems to underestimate our intelligence. But it's fun to regard "Spellbound" as an ancestor of "Inception", with the same flaws in the romantic subplot, better looks from the male lead role, but definitely, a less impressive skiing scene.

    A female psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) protects the identity of an amnesia patient (Gregory Peck) accused of murder while attempting to recover his memory. This is a very special kind of mystery. Not only do we have to figure out whether or not the accused was actually guilty of the crime, but we have to work through his issues of why he has blocked the incident out. Will his remembering exonerate him? Or is he only building a case against himself? I watched this solely because it was recommended for the Salvador Dali dream sequence. Actually, the film as a whole is excellent. The sequence, known for the eyes, is not the most interesting part.

    Psychoanalysis made its way onto the screen many times and certainly in the early days, Hollywood hardly ever achieved anything worth much. Film-Noir was a common Genre that ventured in and out of this World, but even there where much is forbidden the elusive Practice and descriptions of Psychiatry were forever searching for expository verbiage and most of the time it was rendered ridiculous and pedestrian. Even with masters like Hitchcock and Writer Ben Hecht it was a discipline that defied explanatory sentences and were much too deep to be believed in short Scenes or even whole Movies. The hopelessly dated stuff like "Guilt Complex", here the term used over and over, is just is too simple to explain the complexities of the mind and the relation to the plot. The Dream analysis is also contrived to the point that it surrenders all believability. So this Film that so seriously tries to make it all fit and function as steps and paths for the Story to unfold is pathetically forced and can be too much to sustain. There is enough here to be interesting and is quite a different ride than most Movies of the time, and it is framed with conviction and confidence showing us many Artistic and bizarre touches. The highly touted Dali sequence was unparalleled at the time and there is a rousing Music Score and attractive Actors and their is enough sexual symbolism that the audience can create a checklist for some fun. Overall, there is enough here for an entertaining diversion and it is a rather remarkable effort from all involved and it is an example why a Hitchcock Film is not like anything else. It is a wonder.

Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.

    Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations with producer David O. Selznick, "Spellbound" stars Ingrid Bergman as Dr. Constance Petersen, a compassionate but sexually guarded psychotherapist who falls for Dr Edwardes (Gregory Peck), a new doctor who arrives at Green Manors, the mental asylum at which she works. With a creepy, near-supernatural score by Miklos Rozsa, the film oscillates between melodrama and horror. These horrors are largely psychological, but Hitchcock's direction, and Rozsa's score, lend the film a near-paranormal edge. Like "Vertigo", "Spellbound" at times feels like a ghost story or perhaps even a story about ghostly possessions. The issue of "possession" itself becomes the bedrock of Hitchcock's plot. Peck's character is an impostor who has taken possession of Dr Edwardes' persona. From here on, the film becomes another of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" rides. The real Dr Edwardes has turned up dead and law enforcement officials believe Peck to be the murderer. Peck, now revealed to be amnesic, thus goes on the run. He is supported by Constance, who attempts to prove his innocence. With the help of another famous psychoanalyst, she delves into Peck's unconscious and comes out with some semblance of truth. It turns out, she discovers, that Peck has been repressing a very specific childhood trauma: as a kid, he accidentally killed his brother. The film ends with another revelation: the true murderer of Dr Edwardes was an ageing psychoanalyst who himself feared being dispossessed by a younger man. While Peck's an overly stiff actor, Bergman is as magnificent as ever, affording her character a range of subtle facial gestures, and a pleasant mix of intelligence, yearning and vulnerability. Hitchcock, meanwhile, hated hiring Peck, but Selznick kept saddling the director with him; Selznick thought the actor's good looks would bring in big money. The film sports a now famous "dream sequence". It was designed by Salvador Dali, the famous surrealist, but directed by William Cameron Menzies, a man who's been unfairly forgotten by history. The first person to be given the film credits of "art director" and "production designer", Menzies is today most well known for directing the surrealist/expressionist "Invaders From Mars". He was also responsible for a number of pioneering, early special effects, and as art director was responsible for the overall "look" of a number of famous films, most notably "Gone With the Wind", which he storyboarded, colour co-ordinated and co directed. "Spellbound's" dream sequence was originally about 20 minutes long, but was highly censored by Selznick. It contains the animated shadow of a gigantic bird; Hitchcock was himself, reportedly, ornithophobic. Like most of Hitchcock's films, our female hero is treated with much condescension by men. One great scene at a train station finds Constance turning this to her advantage; feigning naivety and playing to a detective's inflated ego, she weasels her way into a hotel room. The rest of the film both mocks and pays tribute to psychoanalysis. One eccentric character's playfully modelled on Freud, for example, the film's psychoanalytical jargon is comically overwrought, and Hitchcock manages to both turn his villain into a psychoanalyst whilst also respectfully turning psychoanalysis into that which solves the film's central crime. Elsewhere the film mistakes psychoanalysis for kitschy "dream reading". In Hitchcock's hands, psychoanalysts are nothing but art critics who decode or ascribe meaning to various warped visions. In Jean-Luc Godard's mammoth "Histoire(s) du cinema", there's a passage in which he pauses to muse about Hitchcock. Hitch, Godard essentially says, is less about content than "decor"; bits of scenery, camera work, clothing, props and moments. You see that with "Spellbound". What you remember are various fragments: powerful point-of-view shots, a subjective shot of a character drinking milk, snow-capped streets, and a shockingly frank scene in which a child is impaled on a fence. Upon release, "Spellbound" was embraced by critics and audiences. Today it's typically viewed as being second tier Hitchcock. It's ultimately a potboiler, tarnished by silly Freudian symbolism, but elevated by exquisite direction and some strong moments of comedy and horror. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.
