    "The MatchMaker" is part romantic comedy, part political satire. A senator (Jay O. Sanders) trying to pander to voters sends his assistant (Janeane Garofalo) to Ireland to find his relatives. While on the Emerald Isle, she catches the attention of rival matchmakers -- that's for people who match each other, not the objects used to light fires -- and a bartender. The movie puts a spin on what has become the stereotype of the Ireland-themed movie: we have all the things that we associate with Eire, but Garofalo's sarcastic character gives the flick exactly what it needs. It goes to show that a movie can still be funny without being an exercise in scatological humor. I certainly enjoyed it. Also starring Milo O'Shea (Friar Laurence in Franco Zefferelli's "Romeo & Juliet"), Rosaleen Linehan, Denis Leary and David O'Hara (Albert Runcorn in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1"). So yes, matchmaker, do make me a match.

    Well, this was it. This was THE movie in the career of Janeane Garafolo. After the surprising success of The Truth About Cats and Dogs in 1996, this was her shot at being a real movie star. How many actresses would kill for a "star vehicle" like this? How many actresses have been able to build entire careers on a breakthrough romantic comedy? This was Janeane Garfolo's shot, her ship had come in, her time had arrivedÂ…and I sincerely hope that after she finished shooting The Matchmaker, she tracked down each and every single person responsible for making this film and beat them all like rented stepchildren. Marcy (Garofalo) is a campaign aide to embattled Massachusetts Senator John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders). Facing near certain defeat in a re-election campaign, the dim-witted Senator and his unbelievable jackass of a campaign manager (Dennis Leary) dispatch Marcy to Ireland to find some Irish relatives to appear in a campaign spot for the Senator and save the election for him. Apparently, hanging out with distant relations in a foreign land is far more important to Massachusetts voters than little things like taxes or health care. Upon arriving in the little town where the Senator's Irish roots are buried, Marcy finds herself with two problems. 1. She can't find any evidence of any McGlory's ever living in the town. 2. She's found herself smack dab in the middle of a matchmaking festival where colorful Irish stereotypes have flooded the small town in search of love. I think you can see where this is going. Marcy is thrown together with Sean (David O'Hara), an Irish journalist who's fled from the "big city" of Dublin back to his tiny home town, and a series of wildly contrived circumstances first unites and then divides them as Marcy sours on the Senator's efforts to exploit the people of this small Irish village to further his political career. Watching a bad movie can stir up many different feelings inside you. Anger. Disgust. Confusion. Astonishment. But the feeling you get watching The Matchmaker is plain and simple sorrow for Janeane Garofalo as you watch her chance at stardom go rocketing down this cinematic toilet. This is one of the most incompetently written films I've ever seen, made all the worse for how it is so awesomely formulaic. It's not just that there isn't a single moment in movie that you haven't seen in every other romantic comedy ever made, it's also that many of those moments don't make a lick of sense. It's almost as though someone took an existing screenplay about a matchmaking festival in an Irish village and then just sprinkled about 40 pages of story about Garofalo's character throughout the script, without making any effort at all to make sure things fit together. T he Matchmaker is like the romantic comedy version of The Last Samurai, but instead of sticking oh-so-Caucasian Tom Cruise into a Japanese story, this one sticks oh-so-acerbic Garafalo into an Irish one where she can stand around and observe the natives' eccentricities. It's actually difficult to fully convey to you how poorly this film is written. Marcy is supposed to be the main character, but in the first half hour of the movie there is literally just a single line a dialog that tells us anything about her as a person. There is literally not a single reason given for why Marcy and Sean start hanging out together or why they'd like each other, let alone love each other. There is literally not a single instant in this story where anything happens for any substantive reason except the script says it's supposed to happen. You can see in The Matchmaker the same thing you could see in The Truth About Cats and Dogs, that there was tremendous potential in Garafalo as a star. She's this pretty little thing with a beautiful smile and a real tough edge to her. But other than ruthlessly exploiting that smile every chance they get, The Matchmaker hasn't the slightest idea what to do with her. Watching this film made me really want to believe in the theory that every decision we make produces an alternate reality where the opposite decision is made. I wish I could see what Janeane Garofalo's career looks like in that parallel universe where she lit the script for The Matchmaker on fire and told her agent to get her something better.

    This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which even I, being a man, could watch without my toenails crinkling or my gonads shriveling up. The movie works perfectly as long as brassy big-city-girl Janeane Garofalo is confronted with an every-clich&eacute;-in-the-book village in the Irish boondocks. This concept stops working as soon as Janeane becomes all gooey gooey about that Irish heartthrob, which happens at about two thirds of the movie. At this point the script tries to tie up too many loose ends and performs a 180&deg; turn towards a happy ending in which big city girl and Oirish oik find true love, the senatorial candiadate wins his election, and the hard-nosed spin doctor commits societal suicide. A bit too much cheese for my palate. Before that the movie was fresh and entertaining -- although it did pander to every clich&eacute; about the emerald isle in the book (the women all have luscious arse-length curly red hair, etc.). Stuff I didn't like: *Marcy (Janeane Garofalo) harping on about how she's addicted to fax machines and the New York Times at inappropriate moments. It just makes her seem self-important and boorish. *The fact that autochtonic love interest Sean isn't just a simple Oirish country yokel but actually a cutting-edge investigative journalist who left the business because he was disgusted by the lack of ethics in the industry. *When Marcy arrives at the hotel, she is told that there aren't any rooms available. No more rooms, huh, she asks back. Nope, none whatsoever, she is told. Then they ask around every hotel in the county. Finally the landlady concedes that they do, after all, have a room with en-suite bathroom and fecking bathtub available. Funny that she didn't think of that in the first place. *That this -- for some dark reason -- was director Mark Joffe's last movie to date. Stuff I did like: *How Marcy, when she is being chatted up by Sean, lowers her voice and asks him intimately: "Is being an idiot like being high all the time?" *The acting, especially of the secondary characters, is amazing. Check out matchmaker Milo O'Shea or the local "it's a filthy, FILTHY business" genealogist. Jay O'Sanders and Dennis Leary also make an amazing couple as the nit-witted senator and his ruthless adviser.

    Oh, 'The Matchmaker'. Is there a more perfect film around?? If you're looking for high-brow entertainment,certainly, but if you want something fluffy to watch on a lonely afternoon then this is what you are seeking. Set for the most part in Ireland, 'The Matchmaker' follows an American city girl who is thrust into a rural setting when her boss, an American senator, sends her to Balinagragh (have no idea how to spell it!) in order to seek out his Irish roots. She accepts the mission, is thrust into the heart of an Irish matchmaking festival, meets a charming Irish rogue and falls in love with the inhabitants of the town. So far, so predictable. However this film is charming and comic; especially in its portrayal or rural/small town Irish life - the depictions are scarily realistic. Garofalo is in her prime in this role; both age-wise and in terms of her performance, as she is portraying a character who is still slightly cynical, but less bitchy and more likable than many of her previous characters. The supporting cast is great and provides the majority of the film's charm; Milo O'Shea particularly standing out as the local matchmaker. These factors, plus the fact that I'm a sucker for an Irish accent,make this film one of the most enjoyable of those i have on my shelves and is watched again and again.

    A wonderful example of the perfectly average romantic comedy. This one gets bonus points for being set largely in Ireland (gorgeous scenery, even more gorgeous accents, and haunting music). It gets detractor points for its hackneyed plot, flat characters, and painfully missed opportunities. All actors do a wonderful job with a terribly flaccid script. The standard "charming" Irish characters are all present -- they mention leprechauns in the picture; perhaps these cardboard cutouts of eccentric Irishmen and Irishwomen are the real leprechauns. The love story itself is remarkably devoid of love or even romance. What saves the film is how much the actors bring to their roles, and how much we as viewers are able to fill in the huge gaps of context, character, dialogue, and significance. We want the picture to succeed, so we cheer along. But as others have noted, once watched, this film is easily forgotten.

    Sorry Mickey Knox and a few others but this is a charming and very funny film. I live with a lady from Dublin and a great many of my friends, here in Israel, are Irish as well. There is no point repeating the plot, others have done so better than I could. It is very funny, it is beautiful to look at and I itch to visit Ireland again so that I can visit the locations. Even in winter Galway looked green and magnificent. The acting is superb throughout. Anything with the Milo O'Shea and David Kelly just has to be. But I am unfair to single out any actors, they are all great, as was the script and direction. True, the story could have told in an hour or so, but who cares, we went to bed happy. I only recorded it from TV one night we were out because it was Irish, no way I will ever wipe it. Let me single out one scene. That in which the Senator is introduced to his "family". Absolutely priceless and should be in anyone's top 100 funny film bits. When the boy enters from the left and says ......... but, no, that would be a spoiler. Just see it for yourself. As for the swearing. I was not offended, it just added authenticity. And the matchmaking really does happen in a small village in Ireland.

    Ladies, if your guy pauses the DVD during the Braveheart scene where blood spatters on the camera lens, and he loves the jaded sarcasm of a Denis Leary rant on Rescue Me, this might be one of the few romantic comedies he'll tolerate for your sake. Mention that The Matchmaker spotlights Braveheart's David O'Hara and that Leary is probably the main reason for an R-rating due to language. If that actually works, and he's anything like my guy, you can needle him about getting misty-eyed during the last 15 minutes of the flick. This is a good movie for established couples with disparate "His and Hers" DVD collections. It meets somewhere in the middle. And it's devoid of all the warm, fuzzy, mushy stuff. Janeane Garofalo's "Marcy" is not particularly graceful or perfectly-coiffed; nor is she a size 2. (Say thank you, ladies). And David O'Hara's "Sean" is equally down-to-earth, never missing an opportunity to take what most date movies would turn into a spectacle of male bravado - and completely bungling it. This one is endearing, and it gives those of us living a flawed existence hope that there is someone equally as flawed out there - just waiting for us to trip over them.

    I really don't understand why Janeanne Garofalo doesn't get more roles. She is a truly wonderful actress who owns the screen when she's on it. There is never anything forced about her performances. They always seem natural. Here, she plays Marcy Tizard, a spin doctor for a U.S. senator trying to get re-elected. Her job has become to track down his relatives from the small town in Ireland where his family emigrated from. This will help the senator secure the Irish vote in Chicago and win him the election. So off to Ireland she goes in an attempt to find his missing relatives. Of course, nothing is ever easy and Marcy finds herself smack dab in the middle of a match making festival. While fending off possible suitors, she becomes entwined in the lives of several colourful locals. Among them is of course, the local matchmaker (Milo O'Shea) who has taken to setting her up with Sean (David O'Hara), the local bartender and former journalist. The humour is warm and the characters are all well drawn out. Denis Leary has a small role as a colleague and resident ***hole. The film truly belongs to Garofalo as she is perfectly cast in the role of weary and cynical Marcy. Give it a shot. It's a near perfect match.

    This movie is so fun. Janeane Garofalo is perfect for the part and David O'Hara is charming. It would be great to see him more. I feel that the casting was well done. The Irish setting is especially lovely. I wish there were more films like this. It is a feel good "Americanish" romantic comedy with a delightful Irish feel which reminds you that there is a world outside of the US. It brings to mind another movie that makes me feel the same: American Women. Again, this movie takes place in Ireland, it transports you as well to a peaceful quaint village with charming characters and lovely scenery. Part of the charm of both these movies is the music.

    This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which even I, being a man, could watch without my toenails crinkling or my gonads shriveling up. The movie works perfectly as long as brassy big-city-girl Janeane Garofalo is confronted with an every-clich&eacute;-in-the-book village in the Irish boondocks. This concept stops working as soon as Janeane becomes all gooey gooey about that Irish heartthrob, which happens at about two thirds of the movie. At this point the script tries to tie up too many loose ends and performs a 180&deg; turn towards a happy ending in which big city girl and Oirish oik find true love, the senatorial candiadate wins his election, and the hard-nosed spin doctor commits societal suicide. A bit too much cheese for my palate.

    Sorry Mickey Knox and a few others but this is a charming and very funny film. I live with a lady from Dublin and a great many of my friends, here in Israel, are Irish as well. There is no point repeating the plot, others have done so better than I could. It is very funny, it is beautiful to look at and I itch to visit Ireland again so that I can visit the locations. Even in winter Galway looked green and magnificent. The acting is superb throughout. Anything with the Milo O'Shea and David Kelly just has to be. But I am unfair to single out any actors, they are all great, as was the script and direction. True, the story could have told in an hour or so, but who cares, we went to bed happy. I only recorded it from TV one night we were out because it was Irish, no way I will ever wipe it. Let me single out one scene. That in which the Senator is introduced to his "family". Absolutely priceless and should be in anyone's top 100 funny film bits. When the boy enters from the left and says ......... but, no, that would be a spoiler. Just see it for yourself. As for the swearing. I was not offended, it just added authenticity. And the matchmaking really does happen in a small village in Ireland.

    Ladies, if your guy pauses the DVD during the Braveheart scene where blood spatters on the camera lens, and he loves the jaded sarcasm of a Denis Leary rant on Rescue Me, this might be one of the few romantic comedies he'll tolerate for your sake. Mention that The Matchmaker spotlights Braveheart's David O'Hara and that Leary is probably the main reason for an R-rating due to language. If that actually works, and he's anything like my guy, you can needle him about getting misty-eyed during the last 15 minutes of the flick. This is a good movie for established couples with disparate "His and Hers" DVD collections. It meets somewhere in the middle. And it's devoid of all the warm, fuzzy, mushy stuff. Janeane Garofalo's "Marcy" is not particularly graceful or perfectly-coiffed; nor is she a size 2. (Say thank you, ladies). And David O'Hara's "Sean" is equally down-to-earth, never missing an opportunity to take what most date movies would turn into a spectacle of male bravado - and completely bungling it. This one is endearing, and it gives those of us living a flawed existence hope that there is someone equally as flawed out there - just waiting for us to trip over them.

    I really don't understand why Janeanne Garofalo doesn't get more roles. She is a truly wonderful actress who owns the screen when she's on it. There is never anything forced about her performances. They always seem natural. Here, she plays Marcy Tizard, a spin doctor for a U.S. senator trying to get re-elected. Her job has become to track down his relatives from the small town in Ireland where his family emigrated from. This will help the senator secure the Irish vote in Chicago and win him the election. So off to Ireland she goes in an attempt to find his missing relatives. Of course, nothing is ever easy and Marcy finds herself smack dab in the middle of a match making festival. While fending off possible suitors, she becomes entwined in the lives of several colourful locals. Among them is of course, the local matchmaker (Milo O'Shea) who has taken to setting her up with Sean (David O'Hara), the local bartender and former journalist. The humour is warm and the characters are all well drawn out. Denis Leary has a small role as a colleague and resident ***hole. The film truly belongs to Garofalo as she is perfectly cast in the role of weary and cynical Marcy. Give it a shot. It's a near perfect match.

    This movie is so fun. Janeane Garofalo is perfect for the part and David O'Hara is charming. It would be great to see him more. I feel that the casting was well done. The Irish setting is especially lovely. I wish there were more films like this. It is a feel good "Americanish" romantic comedy with a delightful Irish feel which reminds you that there is a world outside of the US. It brings to mind another movie that makes me feel the same: American Women. Again, this movie takes place in Ireland, it transports you as well to a peaceful quaint village with charming characters and lovely scenery. Part of the charm of both these movies is the music.

    "The MatchMaker" is part romantic comedy, part political satire. A senator (Jay O. Sanders) trying to pander to voters sends his assistant (Janeane Garofalo) to Ireland to find his relatives. While on the Emerald Isle, she catches the attention of rival matchmakers -- that's for people who match each other, not the objects used to light fires -- and a bartender. The movie puts a spin on what has become the stereotype of the Ireland-themed movie: we have all the things that we associate with Eire, but Garofalo's sarcastic character gives the flick exactly what it needs. It goes to show that a movie can still be funny without being an exercise in scatological humor. I certainly enjoyed it. Also starring Milo O'Shea (Friar Laurence in Franco Zefferelli's "Romeo & Juliet"), Rosaleen Linehan, Denis Leary and David O'Hara (Albert Runcorn in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1"). So yes, matchmaker, do make me a match.

    Well, this was it. This was THE movie in the career of Janeane Garafolo. After the surprising success of The Truth About Cats and Dogs in 1996, this was her shot at being a real movie star. How many actresses would kill for a "star vehicle" like this? How many actresses have been able to build entire careers on a breakthrough romantic comedy? This was Janeane Garfolo's shot, her ship had come in, her time had arrivedÂ…and I sincerely hope that after she finished shooting The Matchmaker, she tracked down each and every single person responsible for making this film and beat them all like rented stepchildren. Marcy (Garofalo) is a campaign aide to embattled Massachusetts Senator John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders). Facing near certain defeat in a re-election campaign, the dim-witted Senator and his unbelievable jackass of a campaign manager (Dennis Leary) dispatch Marcy to Ireland to find some Irish relatives to appear in a campaign spot for the Senator and save the election for him. Apparently, hanging out with distant relations in a foreign land is far more important to Massachusetts voters than little things like taxes or health care. Upon arriving in the little town where the Senator's Irish roots are buried, Marcy finds herself with two problems. 1. She can't find any evidence of any McGlory's ever living in the town. 2. She's found herself smack dab in the middle of a matchmaking festival where colorful Irish stereotypes have flooded the small town in search of love. I think you can see where this is going. Marcy is thrown together with Sean (David O'Hara), an Irish journalist who's fled from the "big city" of Dublin back to his tiny home town, and a series of wildly contrived circumstances first unites and then divides them as Marcy sours on the Senator's efforts to exploit the people of this small Irish village to further his political career. Watching a bad movie can stir up many different feelings inside you. Anger. Disgust. Confusion. Astonishment. But the feeling you get watching The Matchmaker is plain and simple sorrow for Janeane Garofalo as you watch her chance at stardom go rocketing down this cinematic toilet. This is one of the most incompetently written films I've ever seen, made all the worse for how it is so awesomely formulaic. It's not just that there isn't a single moment in movie that you haven't seen in every other romantic comedy ever made, it's also that many of those moments don't make a lick of sense. It's almost as though someone took an existing screenplay about a matchmaking festival in an Irish village and then just sprinkled about 40 pages of story about Garofalo's character throughout the script, without making any effort at all to make sure things fit together. T he Matchmaker is like the romantic comedy version of The Last Samurai, but instead of sticking oh-so-Caucasian Tom Cruise into a Japanese story, this one sticks oh-so-acerbic Garafalo into an Irish one where she can stand around and observe the natives' eccentricities. It's actually difficult to fully convey to you how poorly this film is written. Marcy is supposed to be the main character, but in the first half hour of the movie there is literally just a single line a dialog that tells us anything about her as a person. There is literally not a single reason given for why Marcy and Sean start hanging out together or why they'd like each other, let alone love each other. There is literally not a single instant in this story where anything happens for any substantive reason except the script says it's supposed to happen. You can see in The Matchmaker the same thing you could see in The Truth About Cats and Dogs, that there was tremendous potential in Garafalo as a star. She's this pretty little thing with a beautiful smile and a real tough edge to her. But other than ruthlessly exploiting that smile every chance they get, The Matchmaker hasn't the slightest idea what to do with her. Watching this film made me really want to believe in the theory that every decision we make produces an alternate reality where the opposite decision is made. I wish I could see what Janeane Garofalo's career looks like in that parallel universe where she lit the script for The Matchmaker on fire and told her agent to get her something better.

    This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which even I, being a man, could watch without my toenails crinkling or my gonads shriveling up. The movie works perfectly as long as brassy big-city-girl Janeane Garofalo is confronted with an every-clich&eacute;-in-the-book village in the Irish boondocks. This concept stops working as soon as Janeane becomes all gooey gooey about that Irish heartthrob, which happens at about two thirds of the movie. At this point the script tries to tie up too many loose ends and performs a 180&deg; turn towards a happy ending in which big city girl and Oirish oik find true love, the senatorial candiadate wins his election, and the hard-nosed spin doctor commits societal suicide. A bit too much cheese for my palate. Before that the movie was fresh and entertaining -- although it did pander to every clich&eacute; about the emerald isle in the book (the women all have luscious arse-length curly red hair, etc.). Stuff I didn't like: *Marcy (Janeane Garofalo) harping on about how she's addicted to fax machines and the New York Times at inappropriate moments. It just makes her seem self-important and boorish. *The fact that autochtonic love interest Sean isn't just a simple Oirish country yokel but actually a cutting-edge investigative journalist who left the business because he was disgusted by the lack of ethics in the industry. *When Marcy arrives at the hotel, she is told that there aren't any rooms available. No more rooms, huh, she asks back. Nope, none whatsoever, she is told. Then they ask around every hotel in the county. Finally the landlady concedes that they do, after all, have a room with en-suite bathroom and fecking bathtub available. Funny that she didn't think of that in the first place. *That this -- for some dark reason -- was director Mark Joffe's last movie to date. Stuff I did like: *How Marcy, when she is being chatted up by Sean, lowers her voice and asks him intimately: "Is being an idiot like being high all the time?" *The acting, especially of the secondary characters, is amazing. Check out matchmaker Milo O'Shea or the local "it's a filthy, FILTHY business" genealogist. Jay O'Sanders and Dennis Leary also make an amazing couple as the nit-witted senator and his ruthless adviser.

    Oh, 'The Matchmaker'. Is there a more perfect film around?? If you're looking for high-brow entertainment,certainly, but if you want something fluffy to watch on a lonely afternoon then this is what you are seeking. Set for the most part in Ireland, 'The Matchmaker' follows an American city girl who is thrust into a rural setting when her boss, an American senator, sends her to Balinagragh (have no idea how to spell it!) in order to seek out his Irish roots. She accepts the mission, is thrust into the heart of an Irish matchmaking festival, meets a charming Irish rogue and falls in love with the inhabitants of the town. So far, so predictable. However this film is charming and comic; especially in its portrayal or rural/small town Irish life - the depictions are scarily realistic. Garofalo is in her prime in this role; both age-wise and in terms of her performance, as she is portraying a character who is still slightly cynical, but less bitchy and more likable than many of her previous characters. The supporting cast is great and provides the majority of the film's charm; Milo O'Shea particularly standing out as the local matchmaker. These factors, plus the fact that I'm a sucker for an Irish accent,make this film one of the most enjoyable of those i have on my shelves and is watched again and again.

    A wonderful example of the perfectly average romantic comedy. This one gets bonus points for being set largely in Ireland (gorgeous scenery, even more gorgeous accents, and haunting music). It gets detractor points for its hackneyed plot, flat characters, and painfully missed opportunities. All actors do a wonderful job with a terribly flaccid script. The standard "charming" Irish characters are all present -- they mention leprechauns in the picture; perhaps these cardboard cutouts of eccentric Irishmen and Irishwomen are the real leprechauns. The love story itself is remarkably devoid of love or even romance. What saves the film is how much the actors bring to their roles, and how much we as viewers are able to fill in the huge gaps of context, character, dialogue, and significance. We want the picture to succeed, so we cheer along. But as others have noted, once watched, this film is easily forgotten.

    Sorry Mickey Knox and a few others but this is a charming and very funny film. I live with a lady from Dublin and a great many of my friends, here in Israel, are Irish as well. There is no point repeating the plot, others have done so better than I could. It is very funny, it is beautiful to look at and I itch to visit Ireland again so that I can visit the locations. Even in winter Galway looked green and magnificent. The acting is superb throughout. Anything with the Milo O'Shea and David Kelly just has to be. But I am unfair to single out any actors, they are all great, as was the script and direction. True, the story could have told in an hour or so, but who cares, we went to bed happy. I only recorded it from TV one night we were out because it was Irish, no way I will ever wipe it. Let me single out one scene. That in which the Senator is introduced to his "family". Absolutely priceless and should be in anyone's top 100 funny film bits. When the boy enters from the left and says ......... but, no, that would be a spoiler. Just see it for yourself. As for the swearing. I was not offended, it just added authenticity. And the matchmaking really does happen in a small village in Ireland.

    Ladies, if your guy pauses the DVD during the Braveheart scene where blood spatters on the camera lens, and he loves the jaded sarcasm of a Denis Leary rant on Rescue Me, this might be one of the few romantic comedies he'll tolerate for your sake. Mention that The Matchmaker spotlights Braveheart's David O'Hara and that Leary is probably the main reason for an R-rating due to language. If that actually works, and he's anything like my guy, you can needle him about getting misty-eyed during the last 15 minutes of the flick. This is a good movie for established couples with disparate "His and Hers" DVD collections. It meets somewhere in the middle. And it's devoid of all the warm, fuzzy, mushy stuff. Janeane Garofalo's "Marcy" is not particularly graceful or perfectly-coiffed; nor is she a size 2. (Say thank you, ladies). And David O'Hara's "Sean" is equally down-to-earth, never missing an opportunity to take what most date movies would turn into a spectacle of male bravado - and completely bungling it. This one is endearing, and it gives those of us living a flawed existence hope that there is someone equally as flawed out there - just waiting for us to trip over them.

    This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which even I, being a man, could watch without my toenails crinkling or my gonads shriveling up. The movie works perfectly as long as brassy big-city-girl Janeane Garofalo is confronted with an every-clich&eacute;-in-the-book village in the Irish boondocks. This concept stops working as soon as Janeane becomes all gooey gooey about that Irish heartthrob, which happens at about two thirds of the movie. At this point the script tries to tie up too many loose ends and performs a 180&deg; turn towards a happy ending in which big city girl and Oirish oik find true love, the senatorial candiadate wins his election, and the hard-nosed spin doctor commits societal suicide. A bit too much cheese for my palate. Before that the movie was fresh and entertaining -- although it did pander to every clich&eacute; about the emerald isle in the book (the women all have luscious arse-length curly red hair, etc.). Stuff I didn't like: *Marcy (Janeane Garofalo) harping on about how she's addicted to fax machines and the New York Times at inappropriate moments. It just makes her seem self-important and boorish. *The fact that autochtonic love interest Sean isn't just a simple Oirish country yokel but actually a cutting-edge investigative journalist who left the business because he was disgusted by the lack of ethics in the industry. *When Marcy arrives at the hotel, she is told that there aren't any rooms available. No more rooms, huh, she asks back. Nope, none whatsoever, she is told. Then they ask around every hotel in the county. Finally the landlady concedes that they do, after all, have a room with en-suite bathroom and fecking bathtub available. Funny that she didn't think of that in the first place. *That this -- for some dark reason -- was director Mark Joffe's last movie to date. Stuff I did like: *How Marcy, when she is being chatted up by Sean, lowers her voice and asks him intimately: "Is being an idiot like being high all the time?" *The acting, especially of the secondary characters, is amazing.

She accepts the mission, is thrust into the heart of an Irish matchmaking festival, meets a charming Irish rogue and falls in love with the inhabitants of the town. So far, so predictable. However this film is charming and comic; especially in its portrayal or rural/small town Irish life - the depictions are scarily realistic. Garofalo is in her prime in this role; both age-wise and in terms of her performance, as she is portraying a character who is still slightly cynical, but less bitchy and more likable than many of her previous characters. The supporting cast is great and provides the majority of the film's charm; Milo O'Shea particularly standing out as the local matchmaker. These factors, plus the fact that I'm a sucker for an Irish accent,make this film one of the most enjoyable of those i have on my shelves and is watched again and again.

    A wonderful example of the perfectly average romantic comedy. This one gets bonus points for being set largely in Ireland (gorgeous scenery, even more gorgeous accents, and haunting music). It gets detractor points for its hackneyed plot, flat characters, and painfully missed opportunities. All actors do a wonderful job with a terribly flaccid script. The standard "charming" Irish characters are all present -- they mention leprechauns in the picture; perhaps these cardboard cutouts of eccentric Irishmen and Irishwomen are the real leprechauns. The love story itself is remarkably devoid of love or even romance. What saves the film is how much the actors bring to their roles, and how much we as viewers are able to fill in the huge gaps of context, character, dialogue, and significance. We want the picture to succeed, so we cheer along. But as others have noted, once watched, this film is easily forgotten.

    Sorry Mickey Knox and a few others but this is a charming and very funny film. I live with a lady from Dublin and a great many of my friends, here in Israel, are Irish as well. There is no point repeating the plot, others have done so better than I could. It is very funny, it is beautiful to look at and I itch to visit Ireland again so that I can visit the locations. Even in winter Galway looked green and magnificent. The acting is superb throughout. Anything with the Milo O'Shea and David Kelly just has to be. But I am unfair to single out any actors, they are all great, as was the script and direction. True, the story could have told in an hour or so, but who cares, we went to bed happy. I only recorded it from TV one night we were out because it was Irish, no way I will ever wipe it. Let me single out one scene. That in which the Senator is introduced to his "family". Absolutely priceless and should be in anyone's top 100 funny film bits. When the boy enters from the left and says ......... but, no, that would be a spoiler. Just see it for yourself. As for the swearing. I was not offended, it just added authenticity. And the matchmaking really does happen in a small village in Ireland.

    Ladies, if your guy pauses the DVD during the Braveheart scene where blood spatters on the camera lens, and he loves the jaded sarcasm of a Denis Leary rant on Rescue Me, this might be one of the few romantic comedies he'll tolerate for your sake. Mention that The Matchmaker spotlights Braveheart's David O'Hara and that Leary is probably the main reason for an R-rating due to language. If that actually works, and he's anything like my guy, you can needle him about getting misty-eyed during the last 15 minutes of the flick. This is a good movie for established couples with disparate "His and Hers" DVD collections. It meets somewhere in the middle. And it's devoid of all the warm, fuzzy, mushy stuff. Janeane Garofalo's "Marcy" is not particularly graceful or perfectly-coiffed; nor is she a size 2. (Say thank you, ladies). And David O'Hara's "Sean" is equally down-to-earth, never missing an opportunity to take what most date movies would turn into a spectacle of male bravado - and completely bungling it. This one is endearing, and it gives those of us living a flawed existence hope that there is someone equally as flawed out there - just waiting for us to trip over them.

    I really don't understand why Janeanne Garofalo doesn't get more roles. She is a truly wonderful actress who owns the screen when she's on it. There is never anything forced about her performances. They always seem natural. Here, she plays Marcy Tizard, a spin doctor for a U.S. senator trying to get re-elected. Her job has become to track down his relatives from the small town in Ireland where his family emigrated from. This will help the senator secure the Irish vote in Chicago and win him the election. So off to Ireland she goes in an attempt to find his missing relatives. Of course, nothing is ever easy and Marcy finds herself smack dab in the middle of a match making festival. While fending off possible suitors, she becomes entwined in the lives of several colourful locals. Among them is of course, the local matchmaker (Milo O'Shea) who has taken to setting her up with Sean (David O'Hara), the local bartender and former journalist. The humour is warm and the characters are all well drawn out. Denis Leary has a small role as a colleague and resident ***hole. The film truly belongs to Garofalo as she is perfectly cast in the role of weary and cynical Marcy. Give it a shot. It's a near perfect match.

    This movie is so fun. Janeane Garofalo is perfect for the part and David O'Hara is charming. It would be great to see him more. I feel that the casting was well done. The Irish setting is especially lovely. I wish there were more films like this. It is a feel good "Americanish" romantic comedy with a delightful Irish feel which reminds you that there is a world outside of the US. It brings to mind another movie that makes me feel the same: American Women. Again, this movie takes place in Ireland, it transports you as well to a peaceful quaint village with charming characters and lovely scenery. Part of the charm of both these movies is the music.

    "The MatchMaker" is part romantic comedy, part political satire. A senator (Jay O. Sanders) trying to pander to voters sends his assistant (Janeane Garofalo) to Ireland to find his relatives. While on the Emerald Isle, she catches the attention of rival matchmakers -- that's for people who match each other, not the objects used to light fires -- and a bartender. The movie puts a spin on what has become the stereotype of the Ireland-themed movie: we have all the things that we associate with Eire, but Garofalo's sarcastic character gives the flick exactly what it needs. It goes to show that a movie can still be funny without being an exercise in scatological humor. I certainly enjoyed it. Also starring Milo O'Shea (Friar Laurence in Franco Zefferelli's "Romeo & Juliet"), Rosaleen Linehan, Denis Leary and David O'Hara (Albert Runcorn in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1"). So yes, matchmaker, do make me a match.

    Well, this was it. This was THE movie in the career of Janeane Garafolo. After the surprising success of The Truth About Cats and Dogs in 1996, this was her shot at being a real movie star. How many actresses would kill for a "star vehicle" like this? How many actresses have been able to build entire careers on a breakthrough romantic comedy? This was Janeane Garfolo's shot, her ship had come in, her time had arrivedÂ…and I sincerely hope that after she finished shooting The Matchmaker, she tracked down each and every single person responsible for making this film and beat them all like rented stepchildren. Marcy (Garofalo) is a campaign aide to embattled Massachusetts Senator John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders). Facing near certain defeat in a re-election campaign, the dim-witted Senator and his unbelievable jackass of a campaign manager (Dennis Leary) dispatch Marcy to Ireland to find some Irish relatives to appear in a campaign spot for the Senator and save the election for him. Apparently, hanging out with distant relations in a foreign land is far more important to Massachusetts voters than little things like taxes or health care. Upon arriving in the little town where the Senator's Irish roots are buried, Marcy finds herself with two problems. 1. She can't find any evidence of any McGlory's ever living in the town. 2. She's found herself smack dab in the middle of a matchmaking festival where colorful Irish stereotypes have flooded the small town in search of love. I think you can see where this is going. Marcy is thrown together with Sean (David O'Hara), an Irish journalist who's fled from the "big city" of Dublin back to his tiny home town, and a series of wildly contrived circumstances first unites and then divides them as Marcy sours on the Senator's efforts to exploit the people of this small Irish village to further his political career. Watching a bad movie can stir up many different feelings inside you. Anger. Disgust. Confusion. Astonishment. But the feeling you get watching The Matchmaker is plain and simple sorrow for Janeane Garofalo as you watch her chance at stardom go rocketing down this cinematic toilet. This is one of the most incompetently written films I've ever seen, made all the worse for how it is so awesomely formulaic. It's not just that there isn't a single moment in movie that you haven't seen in every other romantic comedy ever made, it's also that many of those moments don't make a lick of sense. It's almost as though someone took an existing screenplay about a matchmaking festival in an Irish village and then just sprinkled about 40 pages of story about Garofalo's character throughout the script, without making any effort at all to make sure things fit together. T he Matchmaker is like the romantic comedy version of The Last Samurai, but instead of sticking oh-so-Caucasian Tom Cruise into a Japanese story, this one sticks oh-so-acerbic Garafalo into an Irish one where she can stand around and observe the natives' eccentricities. It's actually difficult to fully convey to you how poorly this film is written. Marcy is supposed to be the main character, but in the first half hour of the movie there is literally just a single line a dialog that tells us anything about her as a person. There is literally not a single reason given for why Marcy and Sean start hanging out together or why they'd like each other, let alone love each other. There is literally not a single instant in this story where anything happens for any substantive reason except the script says it's supposed to happen. You can see in The Matchmaker the same thing you could see in The Truth About Cats and Dogs, that there was tremendous potential in Garafalo as a star. She's this pretty little thing with a beautiful smile and a real tough edge to her. But other than ruthlessly exploiting that smile every chance they get, The Matchmaker hasn't the slightest idea what to do with her. Watching this film made me really want to believe in the theory that every decision we make produces an alternate reality where the opposite decision is made. I wish I could see what Janeane Garofalo's career looks like in that parallel universe where she lit the script for The Matchmaker on fire and told her agent to get her something better.

    This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which even I, being a man, could watch without my toenails crinkling or my gonads shriveling up. The movie works perfectly as long as brassy big-city-girl Janeane Garofalo is confronted with an every-clich&eacute;-in-the-book village in the Irish boondocks. This concept stops working as soon as Janeane becomes all gooey gooey about that Irish heartthrob, which happens at about two thirds of the movie. At this point the script tries to tie up too many loose ends and performs a 180&deg; turn towards a happy ending in which big city girl and Oirish oik find true love, the senatorial candiadate wins his election, and the hard-nosed spin doctor commits societal suicide. A bit too much cheese for my palate. Before that the movie was fresh and entertaining -- although it did pander to every clich&eacute; about the emerald isle in the book (the women all have luscious arse-length curly red hair, etc.). Stuff I didn't like: *Marcy (Janeane Garofalo) harping on about how she's addicted to fax machines and the New York Times at inappropriate moments. It just makes her seem self-important and boorish. *The fact that autochtonic love interest Sean isn't just a simple Oirish country yokel but actually a cutting-edge investigative journalist who left the business because he was disgusted by the lack of ethics in the industry. *When Marcy arrives at the hotel, she is told that there aren't any rooms available. No more rooms, huh, she asks back. Nope, none whatsoever, she is told. Then they ask around every hotel in the county. Finally the landlady concedes that they do, after all, have a room with en-suite bathroom and fecking bathtub available. Funny that she didn't think of that in the first place. *That this -- for some dark reason -- was director Mark Joffe's last movie to date. Stuff I did like: *How Marcy, when she is being chatted up by Sean, lowers her voice and asks him intimately: "Is being an idiot like being high all the time?" *The acting, especially of the secondary characters, is amazing. Check out matchmaker Milo O'Shea or the local "it's a filthy, FILTHY business" genealogist. Jay O'Sanders and Dennis Leary also make an amazing couple as the nit-witted senator and his ruthless adviser.

    Oh, 'The Matchmaker'. Is there a more perfect film around?? If you're looking for high-brow entertainment,certainly, but if you want something fluffy to watch on a lonely afternoon then this is what you are seeking. Set for the most part in Ireland, 'The Matchmaker' follows an American city girl who is thrust into a rural setting when her boss, an American senator, sends her to Balinagragh (have no idea how to spell it!) in order to seek out his Irish roots. She accepts the mission, is thrust into the heart of an Irish matchmaking festival, meets a charming Irish rogue and falls in love with the inhabitants of the town. So far, so predictable. However this film is charming and comic; especially in its portrayal or rural/small town Irish life - the depictions are scarily realistic. Garofalo is in her prime in this role; both age-wise and in terms of her performance, as she is portraying a character who is still slightly cynical, but less bitchy and more likable than many of her previous characters. The supporting cast is great and provides the majority of the film's charm; Milo O'Shea particularly standing out as the local matchmaker. These factors, plus the fact that I'm a sucker for an Irish accent,make this film one of the most enjoyable of those i have on my shelves and is watched again and again.

There is no point repeating the plot, others have done so better than I could. It is very funny, it is beautiful to look at and I itch to visit Ireland again so that I can visit the locations. Even in winter Galway looked green and magnificent. The acting is superb throughout. Anything with the Milo O'Shea and David Kelly just has to be. But I am unfair to single out any actors, they are all great, as was the script and direction. True, the story could have told in an hour or so, but who cares, we went to bed happy. I only recorded it from TV one night we were out because it was Irish, no way I will ever wipe it. Let me single out one scene. That in which the Senator is introduced to his "family". Absolutely priceless and should be in anyone's top 100 funny film bits. When the boy enters from the left and says ......... but, no, that would be a spoiler. Just see it for yourself. As for the swearing. I was not offended, it just added authenticity. And the matchmaking really does happen in a small village in Ireland.

    This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which even I, being a man, could watch without my toenails crinkling or my gonads shriveling up. The movie works perfectly as long as brassy big-city-girl Janeane Garofalo is confronted with an every-clich&eacute;-in-the-book village in the Irish boondocks. This concept stops working as soon as Janeane becomes all gooey gooey about that Irish heartthrob, which happens at about two thirds of the movie. At this point the script tries to tie up too many loose ends and performs a 180&deg; turn towards a happy ending in which big city girl and Oirish oik find true love, the senatorial candiadate wins his election, and the hard-nosed spin doctor commits societal suicide. A bit too much cheese for my palate. Before that the movie was fresh and entertaining -- although it did pander to every clich&eacute; about the emerald isle in the book (the women all have luscious arse-length curly red hair, etc.). Stuff I didn't like: *Marcy (Janeane Garofalo) harping on about how she's addicted to fax machines and the New York Times at inappropriate moments. It just makes her seem self-important and boorish. *The fact that autochtonic love interest Sean isn't just a simple Oirish country yokel but actually a cutting-edge investigative journalist who left the business because he was disgusted by the lack of ethics in the industry. *When Marcy arrives at the hotel, she is told that there aren't any rooms available. No more rooms, huh, she asks back. Nope, none whatsoever, she is told. Then they ask around every hotel in the county. Finally the landlady concedes that they do, after all, have a room with en-suite bathroom and fecking bathtub available. Funny that she didn't think of that in the first place. *That this -- for some dark reason -- was director Mark Joffe's last movie to date. Stuff I did like: *How Marcy, when she is being chatted up by Sean, lowers her voice and asks him intimately: "Is being an idiot like being high all the time?" *The acting, especially of the secondary characters, is amazing. Check out matchmaker Milo O'Shea or the local "it's a filthy, FILTHY business" genealogist. Jay O'Sanders and Dennis Leary also make an amazing couple as the nit-witted senator and his ruthless adviser.

    Oh, 'The Matchmaker'. Is there a more perfect film around?? If you're looking for high-brow entertainment,certainly, but if you want something fluffy to watch on a lonely afternoon then this is what you are seeking. Set for the most part in Ireland, 'The Matchmaker' follows an American city girl who is thrust into a rural setting when her boss, an American senator, sends her to Balinagragh (have no idea how to spell it!) in order to seek out his Irish roots. She accepts the mission, is thrust into the heart of an Irish matchmaking festival, meets a charming Irish rogue and falls in love with the inhabitants of the town. So far, so predictable. However this film is charming and comic; especially in its portrayal or rural/small town Irish life - the depictions are scarily realistic. Garofalo is in her prime in this role; both age-wise and in terms of her performance, as she is portraying a character who is still slightly cynical, but less bitchy and more likable than many of her previous characters. The supporting cast is great and provides the majority of the film's charm; Milo O'Shea particularly standing out as the local matchmaker. These factors, plus the fact that I'm a sucker for an Irish accent,make this film one of the most enjoyable of those i have on my shelves and is watched again and again.

    A wonderful example of the perfectly average romantic comedy. This one gets bonus points for being set largely in Ireland (gorgeous scenery, even more gorgeous accents, and haunting music). It gets detractor points for its hackneyed plot, flat characters, and painfully missed opportunities. All actors do a wonderful job with a terribly flaccid script. The standard "charming" Irish characters are all present -- they mention leprechauns in the picture; perhaps these cardboard cutouts of eccentric Irishmen and Irishwomen are the real leprechauns. The love story itself is remarkably devoid of love or even romance. What saves the film is how much the actors bring to their roles, and how much we as viewers are able to fill in the huge gaps of context, character, dialogue, and significance. We want the picture to succeed, so we cheer along. But as others have noted, once watched, this film is easily forgotten.

    Sorry Mickey Knox and a few others but this is a charming and very funny film. I live with a lady from Dublin and a great many of my friends, here in Israel, are Irish as well. There is no point repeating the plot, others have done so better than I could. It is very funny, it is beautiful to look at and I itch to visit Ireland again so that I can visit the locations. Even in winter Galway looked green and magnificent. The acting is superb throughout. Anything with the Milo O'Shea and David Kelly just has to be. But I am unfair to single out any actors, they are all great, as was the script and direction. True, the story could have told in an hour or so, but who cares, we went to bed happy. I only recorded it from TV one night we were out because it was Irish, no way I will ever wipe it. Let me single out one scene. That in which the Senator is introduced to his "family". Absolutely priceless and should be in anyone's top 100 funny film bits. When the boy enters from the left and says ......... but, no, that would be a spoiler. Just see it for yourself. As for the swearing. I was not offended, it just added authenticity. And the matchmaking really does happen in a small village in Ireland.

    Ladies, if your guy pauses the DVD during the Braveheart scene where blood spatters on the camera lens, and he loves the jaded sarcasm of a Denis Leary rant on Rescue Me, this might be one of the few romantic comedies he'll tolerate for your sake. Mention that The Matchmaker spotlights Braveheart's David O'Hara and that Leary is probably the main reason for an R-rating due to language. If that actually works, and he's anything like my guy, you can needle him about getting misty-eyed during the last 15 minutes of the flick. This is a good movie for established couples with disparate "His and Hers" DVD collections. It meets somewhere in the middle. And it's devoid of all the warm, fuzzy, mushy stuff. Janeane Garofalo's "Marcy" is not particularly graceful or perfectly-coiffed; nor is she a size 2. (Say thank you, ladies). And David O'Hara's "Sean" is equally down-to-earth, never missing an opportunity to take what most date movies would turn into a spectacle of male bravado - and completely bungling it. This one is endearing, and it gives those of us living a flawed existence hope that there is someone equally as flawed out there - just waiting for us to trip over them.

    I really don't understand why Janeanne Garofalo doesn't get more roles. She is a truly wonderful actress who owns the screen when she's on it. There is never anything forced about her performances. They always seem natural. Here, she plays Marcy Tizard, a spin doctor for a U.S. senator trying to get re-elected. Her job has become to track down his relatives from the small town in Ireland where his family emigrated from. This will help the senator secure the Irish vote in Chicago and win him the election. So off to Ireland she goes in an attempt to find his missing relatives. Of course, nothing is ever easy and Marcy finds herself smack dab in the middle of a match making festival. While fending off possible suitors, she becomes entwined in the lives of several colourful locals. Among them is of course, the local matchmaker (Milo O'Shea) who has taken to setting her up with Sean (David O'Hara), the local bartender and former journalist. The humour is warm and the characters are all well drawn out. Denis Leary has a small role as a colleague and resident ***hole. The film truly belongs to Garofalo as she is perfectly cast in the role of weary and cynical Marcy. Give it a shot. It's a near perfect match.

    This movie is so fun. Janeane Garofalo is perfect for the part and David O'Hara is charming. It would be great to see him more. I feel that the casting was well done. The Irish setting is especially lovely. I wish there were more films like this. It is a feel good "Americanish" romantic comedy with a delightful Irish feel which reminds you that there is a world outside of the US. It brings to mind another movie that makes me feel the same: American Women. Again, this movie takes place in Ireland, it transports you as well to a peaceful quaint village with charming characters and lovely scenery. Part of the charm of both these movies is the music.

    "The MatchMaker" is part romantic comedy, part political satire. A senator (Jay O. Sanders) trying to pander to voters sends his assistant (Janeane Garofalo) to Ireland to find his relatives. While on the Emerald Isle, she catches the attention of rival matchmakers -- that's for people who match each other, not the objects used to light fires -- and a bartender. The movie puts a spin on what has become the stereotype of the Ireland-themed movie: we have all the things that we associate with Eire, but Garofalo's sarcastic character gives the flick exactly what it needs. It goes to show that a movie can still be funny without being an exercise in scatological humor. I certainly enjoyed it. Also starring Milo O'Shea (Friar Laurence in Franco Zefferelli's "Romeo & Juliet"), Rosaleen Linehan, Denis Leary and David O'Hara (Albert Runcorn in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1"). So yes, matchmaker, do make me a match.

    Well, this was it. This was THE movie in the career of Janeane Garafolo. After the surprising success of The Truth About Cats and Dogs in 1996, this was her shot at being a real movie star. How many actresses would kill for a "star vehicle" like this? How many actresses have been able to build entire careers on a breakthrough romantic comedy? This was Janeane Garfolo's shot, her ship had come in, her time had arrivedÂ…and I sincerely hope that after she finished shooting The Matchmaker, she tracked down each and every single person responsible for making this film and beat them all like rented stepchildren. Marcy (Garofalo) is a campaign aide to embattled Massachusetts Senator John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders). Facing near certain defeat in a re-election campaign, the dim-witted Senator and his unbelievable jackass of a campaign manager (Dennis Leary) dispatch Marcy to Ireland to find some Irish relatives to appear in a campaign spot for the Senator and save the election for him. Apparently, hanging out with distant relations in a foreign land is far more important to Massachusetts voters than little things like taxes or health care. Upon arriving in the little town where the Senator's Irish roots are buried, Marcy finds herself with two problems. 1. She can't find any evidence of any McGlory's ever living in the town. 2. She's found herself smack dab in the middle of a matchmaking festival where colorful Irish stereotypes have flooded the small town in search of love. I think you can see where this is going. Marcy is thrown together with Sean (David O'Hara), an Irish journalist who's fled from the "big city" of Dublin back to his tiny home town, and a series of wildly contrived circumstances first unites and then divides them as Marcy sours on the Senator's efforts to exploit the people of this small Irish village to further his political career. Watching a bad movie can stir up many different feelings inside you. Anger. Disgust. Confusion. Astonishment. But the feeling you get watching The Matchmaker is plain and simple sorrow for Janeane Garofalo as you watch her chance at stardom go rocketing down this cinematic toilet. This is one of the most incompetently written films I've ever seen, made all the worse for how it is so awesomely formulaic. It's not just that there isn't a single moment in movie that you haven't seen in every other romantic comedy ever made, it's also that many of those moments don't make a lick of sense. It's almost as though someone took an existing screenplay about a matchmaking festival in an Irish village and then just sprinkled about 40 pages of story about Garofalo's character throughout the script, without making any effort at all to make sure things fit together. T he Matchmaker is like the romantic comedy version of The Last Samurai, but instead of sticking oh-so-Caucasian Tom Cruise into a Japanese story, this one sticks oh-so-acerbic Garafalo into an Irish one where she can stand around and observe the natives' eccentricities. It's actually difficult to fully convey to you how poorly this film is written. Marcy is supposed to be the main character, but in the first half hour of the movie there is literally just a single line a dialog that tells us anything about her as a person. There is literally not a single reason given for why Marcy and Sean start hanging out together or why they'd like each other, let alone love each other. There is literally not a single instant in this story where anything happens for any substantive reason except the script says it's supposed to happen. You can see in The Matchmaker the same thing you could see in The Truth About Cats and Dogs, that there was tremendous potential in Garafalo as a star. She's this pretty little thing with a beautiful smile and a real tough edge to her. But other than ruthlessly exploiting that smile every chance they get, The Matchmaker hasn't the slightest idea what to do with her. Watching this film made me really want to believe in the theory that every decision we make produces an alternate reality where the opposite decision is made. I wish I could see what Janeane Garofalo's career looks like in that parallel universe where she lit the script for The Matchmaker on fire and told her agent to get her something better.

    This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which even I, being a man, could watch without my toenails crinkling or my gonads shriveling up. The movie works perfectly as long as brassy big-city-girl Janeane Garofalo is confronted with an every-clich&eacute;-in-the-book village in the Irish boondocks. This concept stops working as soon as Janeane becomes all gooey gooey about that Irish heartthrob, which happens at about two thirds of the movie. At this point the script tries to tie up too many loose ends and performs a 180&deg; turn towards a happy ending in which big city girl and Oirish oik find true love, the senatorial candiadate wins his election, and the hard-nosed spin doctor commits societal suicide. A bit too much cheese for my palate. Before that the movie was fresh and entertaining -- although it did pander to every clich&eacute; about the emerald isle in the book (the women all have luscious arse-length curly red hair, etc.). Stuff I didn't like: *Marcy (Janeane Garofalo) harping on about how she's addicted to fax machines and the New York Times at inappropriate moments. It just makes her seem self-important and boorish. *The fact that autochtonic love interest Sean isn't just a simple Oirish country yokel but actually a cutting-edge investigative journalist who left the business because he was disgusted by the lack of ethics in the industry. *When Marcy arrives at the hotel, she is told that there aren't any rooms available. No more rooms, huh, she asks back. Nope, none whatsoever, she is told. Then they ask around every hotel in the county. Finally the landlady concedes that they do, after all, have a room with en-suite bathroom and fecking bathtub available. Funny that she didn't think of that in the first place. *That this -- for some dark reason -- was director Mark Joffe's last movie to date. Stuff I did like: *How Marcy, when she is being chatted up by Sean, lowers her voice and asks him intimately: "Is being an idiot like being high all the time?" *The acting, especially of the secondary characters, is amazing. Check out matchmaker Milo O'Shea or the local "it's a filthy, FILTHY business" genealogist. Jay O'Sanders and Dennis Leary also make an amazing couple as the nit-witted senator and his ruthless adviser.

Marcy (Garofalo) is a campaign aide to embattled Massachusetts Senator John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders). Facing near certain defeat in a re-election campaign, the dim-witted Senator and his unbelievable jackass of a campaign manager (Dennis Leary) dispatch Marcy to Ireland to find some Irish relatives to appear in a campaign spot for the Senator and save the election for him. Apparently, hanging out with distant relations in a foreign land is far more important to Massachusetts voters than little things like taxes or health care. Upon arriving in the little town where the Senator's Irish roots are buried, Marcy finds herself with two problems. 1. She can't find any evidence of any McGlory's ever living in the town. 2. She's found herself smack dab in the middle of a matchmaking festival where colorful Irish stereotypes have flooded the small town in search of love. I think you can see where this is going. Marcy is thrown together with Sean (David O'Hara), an Irish journalist who's fled from the "big city" of Dublin back to his tiny home town, and a series of wildly contrived circumstances first unites and then divides them as Marcy sours on the Senator's efforts to exploit the people of this small Irish village to further his political career. Watching a bad movie can stir up many different feelings inside you. Anger. Disgust. Confusion. Astonishment. But the feeling you get watching The Matchmaker is plain and simple sorrow for Janeane Garofalo as you watch her chance at stardom go rocketing down this cinematic toilet. This is one of the most incompetently written films I've ever seen, made all the worse for how it is so awesomely formulaic. It's not just that there isn't a single moment in movie that you haven't seen in every other romantic comedy ever made, it's also that many of those moments don't make a lick of sense. It's almost as though someone took an existing screenplay about a matchmaking festival in an Irish village and then just sprinkled about 40 pages of story about Garofalo's character throughout the script, without making any effort at all to make sure things fit together. T he Matchmaker is like the romantic comedy version of The Last Samurai, but instead of sticking oh-so-Caucasian Tom Cruise into a Japanese story, this one sticks oh-so-acerbic Garafalo into an Irish one where she can stand around and observe the natives' eccentricities. It's actually difficult to fully convey to you how poorly this film is written. Marcy is supposed to be the main character, but in the first half hour of the movie there is literally just a single line a dialog that tells us anything about her as a person. There is literally not a single reason given for why Marcy and Sean start hanging out together or why they'd like each other, let alone love each other. There is literally not a single instant in this story where anything happens for any substantive reason except the script says it's supposed to happen. You can see in The Matchmaker the same thing you could see in The Truth About Cats and Dogs, that there was tremendous potential in Garafalo as a star. She's this pretty little thing with a beautiful smile and a real tough edge to her. But other than ruthlessly exploiting that smile every chance they get, The Matchmaker hasn't the slightest idea what to do with her. Watching this film made me really want to believe in the theory that every decision we make produces an alternate reality where the opposite decision is made. I wish I could see what Janeane Garofalo's career looks like in that parallel universe where she lit the script for The Matchmaker on fire and told her agent to get her something better.

    This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which even I, being a man, could watch without my toenails crinkling or my gonads shriveling up. The movie works perfectly as long as brassy big-city-girl Janeane Garofalo is confronted with an every-clich&eacute;-in-the-book village in the Irish boondocks. This concept stops working as soon as Janeane becomes all gooey gooey about that Irish heartthrob, which happens at about two thirds of the movie. At this point the script tries to tie up too many loose ends and performs a 180&deg; turn towards a happy ending in which big city girl and Oirish oik find true love, the senatorial candiadate wins his election, and the hard-nosed spin doctor commits societal suicide. A bit too much cheese for my palate. Before that the movie was fresh and entertaining -- although it did pander to every clich&eacute; about the emerald isle in the book (the women all have luscious arse-length curly red hair, etc.). Stuff I didn't like: *Marcy (Janeane Garofalo) harping on about how she's addicted to fax machines and the New York Times at inappropriate moments. It just makes her seem self-important and boorish. *The fact that autochtonic love interest Sean isn't just a simple Oirish country yokel but actually a cutting-edge investigative journalist who left the business because he was disgusted by the lack of ethics in the industry. *When Marcy arrives at the hotel, she is told that there aren't any rooms available. No more rooms, huh, she asks back. Nope, none whatsoever, she is told. Then they ask around every hotel in the county. Finally the landlady concedes that they do, after all, have a room with en-suite bathroom and fecking bathtub available. Funny that she didn't think of that in the first place. *That this -- for some dark reason -- was director Mark Joffe's last movie to date. Stuff I did like: *How Marcy, when she is being chatted up by Sean, lowers her voice and asks him intimately: "Is being an idiot like being high all the time?" *The acting, especially of the secondary characters, is amazing. Check out matchmaker Milo O'Shea or the local "it's a filthy, FILTHY business" genealogist. Jay O'Sanders and Dennis Leary also make an amazing couple as the nit-witted senator and his ruthless adviser.

    Oh, 'The Matchmaker'. Is there a more perfect film around?? If you're looking for high-brow entertainment,certainly, but if you want something fluffy to watch on a lonely afternoon then this is what you are seeking. Set for the most part in Ireland, 'The Matchmaker' follows an American city girl who is thrust into a rural setting when her boss, an American senator, sends her to Balinagragh (have no idea how to spell it!) in order to seek out his Irish roots. She accepts the mission, is thrust into the heart of an Irish matchmaking festival, meets a charming Irish rogue and falls in love with the inhabitants of the town. So far, so predictable. However this film is charming and comic; especially in its portrayal or rural/small town Irish life - the depictions are scarily realistic. Garofalo is in her prime in this role; both age-wise and in terms of her performance, as she is portraying a character who is still slightly cynical, but less bitchy and more likable than many of her previous characters. The supporting cast is great and provides the majority of the film's charm; Milo O'Shea particularly standing out as the local matchmaker. These factors, plus the fact that I'm a sucker for an Irish accent,make this film one of the most enjoyable of those i have on my shelves and is watched again and again.

    A wonderful example of the perfectly average romantic comedy. This one gets bonus points for being set largely in Ireland (gorgeous scenery, even more gorgeous accents, and haunting music). It gets detractor points for its hackneyed plot, flat characters, and painfully missed opportunities. All actors do a wonderful job with a terribly flaccid script. The standard "charming" Irish characters are all present -- they mention leprechauns in the picture; perhaps these cardboard cutouts of eccentric Irishmen and Irishwomen are the real leprechauns. The love story itself is remarkably devoid of love or even romance. What saves the film is how much the actors bring to their roles, and how much we as viewers are able to fill in the huge gaps of context, character, dialogue, and significance. We want the picture to succeed, so we cheer along. But as others have noted, once watched, this film is easily forgotten.

    Sorry Mickey Knox and a few others but this is a charming and very funny film. I live with a lady from Dublin and a great many of my friends, here in Israel, are Irish as well. There is no point repeating the plot, others have done so better than I could. It is very funny, it is beautiful to look at and I itch to visit Ireland again so that I can visit the locations. Even in winter Galway looked green and magnificent. The acting is superb throughout. Anything with the Milo O'Shea and David Kelly just has to be. But I am unfair to single out any actors, they are all great, as was the script and direction. True, the story could have told in an hour or so, but who cares, we went to bed happy. I only recorded it from TV one night we were out because it was Irish, no way I will ever wipe it. Let me single out one scene. That in which the Senator is introduced to his "family". Absolutely priceless and should be in anyone's top 100 funny film bits. When the boy enters from the left and says ......... but, no, that would be a spoiler. Just see it for yourself. As for the swearing. I was not offended, it just added authenticity. And the matchmaking really does happen in a small village in Ireland.

    Ladies, if your guy pauses the DVD during the Braveheart scene where blood spatters on the camera lens, and he loves the jaded sarcasm of a Denis Leary rant on Rescue Me, this might be one of the few romantic comedies he'll tolerate for your sake. Mention that The Matchmaker spotlights Braveheart's David O'Hara and that Leary is probably the main reason for an R-rating due to language. If that actually works, and he's anything like my guy, you can needle him about getting misty-eyed during the last 15 minutes of the flick. This is a good movie for established couples with disparate "His and Hers" DVD collections. It meets somewhere in the middle. And it's devoid of all the warm, fuzzy, mushy stuff. Janeane Garofalo's "Marcy" is not particularly graceful or perfectly-coiffed; nor is she a size 2. (Say thank you, ladies). And David O'Hara's "Sean" is equally down-to-earth, never missing an opportunity to take what most date movies would turn into a spectacle of male bravado - and completely bungling it. This one is endearing, and it gives those of us living a flawed existence hope that there is someone equally as flawed out there - just waiting for us to trip over them.

    I really don't understand why Janeanne Garofalo doesn't get more roles. She is a truly wonderful actress who owns the screen when she's on it. There is never anything forced about her performances. They always seem natural. Here, she plays Marcy Tizard, a spin doctor for a U.S. senator trying to get re-elected. Her job has become to track down his relatives from the small town in Ireland where his family emigrated from. This will help the senator secure the Irish vote in Chicago and win him the election. So off to Ireland she goes in an attempt to find his missing relatives. Of course, nothing is ever easy and Marcy finds herself smack dab in the middle of a match making festival. While fending off possible suitors, she becomes entwined in the lives of several colourful locals. Among them is of course, the local matchmaker (Milo O'Shea) who has taken to setting her up with Sean (David O'Hara), the local bartender and former journalist. The humour is warm and the characters are all well drawn out. Denis Leary has a small role as a colleague and resident ***hole. The film truly belongs to Garofalo as she is perfectly cast in the role of weary and cynical Marcy. Give it a shot. It's a near perfect match.

    This movie is so fun. Janeane Garofalo is perfect for the part and David O'Hara is charming. It would be great to see him more. I feel that the casting was well done. The Irish setting is especially lovely. I wish there were more films like this. It is a feel good "Americanish" romantic comedy with a delightful Irish feel which reminds you that there is a world outside of the US. It brings to mind another movie that makes me feel the same: American Women. Again, this movie takes place in Ireland, it transports you as well to a peaceful quaint village with charming characters and lovely scenery. Part of the charm of both these movies is the music.

    "The MatchMaker" is part romantic comedy, part political satire. A senator (Jay O. Sanders) trying to pander to voters sends his assistant (Janeane Garofalo) to Ireland to find his relatives. While on the Emerald Isle, she catches the attention of rival matchmakers -- that's for people who match each other, not the objects used to light fires -- and a bartender. The movie puts a spin on what has become the stereotype of the Ireland-themed movie: we have all the things that we associate with Eire, but Garofalo's sarcastic character gives the flick exactly what it needs. It goes to show that a movie can still be funny without being an exercise in scatological humor. I certainly enjoyed it. Also starring Milo O'Shea (Friar Laurence in Franco Zefferelli's "Romeo & Juliet"), Rosaleen Linehan, Denis Leary and David O'Hara (Albert Runcorn in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1"). So yes, matchmaker, do make me a match.

    Well, this was it. This was THE movie in the career of Janeane Garafolo. After the surprising success of The Truth About Cats and Dogs in 1996, this was her shot at being a real movie star. How many actresses would kill for a "star vehicle" like this? How many actresses have been able to build entire careers on a breakthrough romantic comedy? This was Janeane Garfolo's shot, her ship had come in, her time had arrivedÂ…and I sincerely hope that after she finished shooting The Matchmaker, she tracked down each and every single person responsible for making this film and beat them all like rented stepchildren. Marcy (Garofalo) is a campaign aide to embattled Massachusetts Senator John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders). Facing near certain defeat in a re-election campaign, the dim-witted Senator and his unbelievable jackass of a campaign manager (Dennis Leary) dispatch Marcy to Ireland to find some Irish relatives to appear in a campaign spot for the Senator and save the election for him. Apparently, hanging out with distant relations in a foreign land is far more important to Massachusetts voters than little things like taxes or health care. Upon arriving in the little town where the Senator's Irish roots are buried, Marcy finds herself with two problems. 1. She can't find any evidence of any McGlory's ever living in the town. 2. She's found herself smack dab in the middle of a matchmaking festival where colorful Irish stereotypes have flooded the small town in search of love. I think you can see where this is going. Marcy is thrown together with Sean (David O'Hara), an Irish journalist who's fled from the "big city" of Dublin back to his tiny home town, and a series of wildly contrived circumstances first unites and then divides them as Marcy sours on the Senator's efforts to exploit the people of this small Irish village to further his political career. Watching a bad movie can stir up many different feelings inside you. Anger. Disgust. Confusion. Astonishment. But the feeling you get watching The Matchmaker is plain and simple sorrow for Janeane Garofalo as you watch her chance at stardom go rocketing down this cinematic toilet. This is one of the most incompetently written films I've ever seen, made all the worse for how it is so awesomely formulaic. It's not just that there isn't a single moment in movie that you haven't seen in every other romantic comedy ever made, it's also that many of those moments don't make a lick of sense. It's almost as though someone took an existing screenplay about a matchmaking festival in an Irish village and then just sprinkled about 40 pages of story about Garofalo's character throughout the script, without making any effort at all to make sure things fit together. T he Matchmaker is like the romantic comedy version of The Last Samurai, but instead of sticking oh-so-Caucasian Tom Cruise into a Japanese story, this one sticks oh-so-acerbic Garafalo into an Irish one where she can stand around and observe the natives' eccentricities. It's actually difficult to fully convey to you how poorly this film is written. Marcy is supposed to be the main character, but in the first half hour of the movie there is literally just a single line a dialog that tells us anything about her as a person. There is literally not a single reason given for why Marcy and Sean start hanging out together or why they'd like each other, let alone love each other. There is literally not a single instant in this story where anything happens for any substantive reason except the script says it's supposed to happen. You can see in The Matchmaker the same thing you could see in The Truth About Cats and Dogs, that there was tremendous potential in Garafalo as a star. She's this pretty little thing with a beautiful smile and a real tough edge to her. But other than ruthlessly exploiting that smile every chance they get, The Matchmaker hasn't the slightest idea what to do with her. Watching this film made me really want to believe in the theory that every decision we make produces an alternate reality where the opposite decision is made. I wish I could see what Janeane Garofalo's career looks like in that parallel universe where she lit the script for The Matchmaker on fire and told her agent to get her something better.

    This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which even I, being a man, could watch without my toenails crinkling or my gonads shriveling up. The movie works perfectly as long as brassy big-city-girl Janeane Garofalo is confronted with an every-clich&eacute;-in-the-book village in the Irish boondocks. This concept stops working as soon as Janeane becomes all gooey gooey about that Irish heartthrob, which happens at about two thirds of the movie. At this point the script tries to tie up too many loose ends and performs a 180&deg; turn towards a happy ending in which big city girl and Oirish oik find true love, the senatorial candiadate wins his election, and the hard-nosed spin doctor commits societal suicide. A bit too much cheese for my palate. Before that the movie was fresh and entertaining -- although it did pander to every clich&eacute; about the emerald isle in the book (the women all have luscious arse-length curly red hair, etc.). Stuff I didn't like: *Marcy (Janeane Garofalo) harping on about how she's addicted to fax machines and the New York Times at inappropriate moments. It just makes her seem self-important and boorish. *The fact that autochtonic love interest Sean isn't just a simple Oirish country yokel but actually a cutting-edge investigative journalist who left the business because he was disgusted by the lack of ethics in the industry. *When Marcy arrives at the hotel, she is told that there aren't any rooms available. No more rooms, huh, she asks back. Nope, none whatsoever, she is told. Then they ask around every hotel in the county. Finally the landlady concedes that they do, after all, have a room with en-suite bathroom and fecking bathtub available. Funny that she didn't think of that in the first place. *That this -- for some dark reason -- was director Mark Joffe's last movie to date. Stuff I did like: *How Marcy, when she is being chatted up by Sean, lowers her voice and asks him intimately: "Is being an idiot like being high all the time?" *The acting, especially of the secondary characters, is amazing.

Absolutely priceless and should be in anyone's top 100 funny film bits. When the boy enters from the left and says ......... but, no, that would be a spoiler. Just see it for yourself.

The film truly belongs to Garofalo as she is perfectly cast in the role of weary and cynical Marcy. Give it a shot. It's a near perfect match.

    This movie is so fun. Janeane Garofalo is perfect for the part and David O'Hara is charming. It would be great to see him more. I feel that the casting was well done. The Irish setting is especially lovely. I wish there were more films like this. It is a feel good "Americanish" romantic comedy with a delightful Irish feel which reminds you that there is a world outside of the US. It brings to mind another movie that makes me feel the same: American Women. Again, this movie takes place in Ireland, it transports you as well to a peaceful quaint village with charming characters and lovely scenery. Part of the charm of both these movies is the music.
