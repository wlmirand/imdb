 <sinopse>
  Elwood must reunite the old band, with a few new members, and go on another "Mission from God."
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Elwood, the now lone "Blues Brother" finally released from prison, is once again enlisted by Sister Mary Stigmata in her latest crusade to raise funds for a children's hospital. Once again hitting the road to re-unite the band and win the big prize at the New Orleans Battle of the Bands, Elwood is pursued cross-country by the cops, led by Cabel the Curtis' son (and Elwood's step-brother), the Russian Mafia, and a militia group. On his new "mission from God" Elwood enlists the help of a young orphan, and a strip club bartender.

    This directionless and unnecessary sequel sees Dan Aykroyd reforming the old Blues Brothers band, this time with John Goodman, Joe Morton and where-is-he-now child actor J. Evan Bonifant. There's no story, just a series of musical set pieces and car crashes - much like the original movie, only not as good. Too much of the film is devoted to prolonged set-up, very few jokes are funny, and John Landis's direction is hopelessly static. But the music, as before, is fantastic; the concert sequences have an energy sorely lacking in the rest of the film. In the name of full disclosure, there is one terrific scene: a huge pile up in which car after car after car after smash into each other until there's a ridiculously huge pile of tangled metal in the middle of the road. Otherwise, it's missable.

    The whole movie seemed like a throwback/tribute to the original. It didn't really try at all to stand on its own merits, it just came across as an excuse for the cast (most of whom were in the original) to relive the good ole' days. Most of the scenes and plot points mirrored those of the original film. Aside from that, the signature clothing (black suit, black fedora, sunglasses, etc.) and the Bluesmobile, this movie is almost unrecognizable from the original film. Out of the two stars of the original, only Dan Aykroyd survived to make this film. (RIP John Belushi.) Unfortunately, Elwood Blues must have gone to the grave with Jake Blues, because Dan Aykroyd's reprisal of his role is disgraceful. Elwood's voice, accent, mannerisms, and overall attitude have totally changed...for the worse. A once mysterious, serious, resourceful, and charming character has been warped into a worthless goofball, and this change sets the tone for the rest of the movie as well. The original movie, though very funny, had a serious tone to it (at least the performances seemed that way), but Blues Brothers 2000 is just goofy and cheesy. The only thing that I can compare the goofiness/cheesiness to is a kids movie...which makes sense since one of the main characters of this movie IS a kid, "Buster Blues". After visiting The Penguin from the original movie, Elwood gets stuck mentoring an orphan boy, Buster, who turns out to be a blues prodigy. Add John Goodman's equally goofy character, "Mighty" Mack McTeer, into the mix and you've got a recipe for disaster. The only things that saves this movie from being a 0/10 are the outstanding musical sequences (with the exception of Johnny Lang's "contribution"). With the exception of John Belushi, the original band is reunited in this film and they do not disappoint! The Blues Brothers Band and the various cameos from famous musicians throughout the movie are reason enough to watch it. The final sequence, a Battle of the Bands contest, is particularly good. To Summarize: the movie sucks, but the music is great! Watch it at least once, especially if you've seen the original.

    If a sequel to the iconic 1980's film The Blues Brothers needed to be made, I would've much rather seem John Goodman assume the role of Jake Blues, the chubby and talky half of the Blues brothers rather than watch an overlong, padded out tribute film to the group, involving the surviving half of the brothers, Elwood, desperately try to get the old band back together in an effort to keep the blues alive. There is an uncanny stench of desperation from the screen as the obligatory sequel plot takes fold and sadly consumes the iconic trail the original 1980's classic paved. I recall my original review of The Blues Brothers with dread upon viewing its unnecessary sequel. I stated, "there are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them," and conclude with, "The Blues Brothers is a fun, energized comedy that starts fast and rarely lets up in terms of comedy and music. It's a Chicago classic and one of the funniest and smartest musical comedies I have yet to see." The sequel takes all the fun out of its formula and replaces it with wasted energy. There's nothing here that couldn't have been simply put on a soundtrack and left at that. Dan Aykroyd reprises his role as Elwood, as he tries so hard to make new friendships, one of which involving a ten year old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), who he takes along upon learning of his rather somber roots at the orphanage Jake and Elwood were raised in and saved from being demolished in the original film. He learns that Buster has a talent for playing the harmonica and gives him a slick suit and shades to join in the revival band. Elwood also recruits Mack McTeer (played by John Goodman), a bartender from a new strip club he has just found out about, and Cab (Joe Morton), the illegitimate son of an old friend who is initially bitter and cold towards the idea of a band but soon can not refuse. One of the strongest moments is the three minute long musical rendition of Wilson Pickett's "634-5789," about a phone number, when dialed, will connect the lonely caller to attractive women who will provide them with a good time. If only they saw who was really working the phone lines. For every infectious dance sequence we get, we get an endless amount of stale comedy littered with unimpressive jokes and redundant banter. The musical numbers are the saving grace here but, again, that's what soundtracks are for. It's hard to say exactly where Blues Brothers 2000 goes wrong. It seems to have all the working components for a sequel to the original film. It is written by Aykroyd himself and John Landis (who again assumes the director role), two men who should know the material better than any soul, and we can see they desperately tried to work around the deaths of co-workers John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy in order to make a sequel work, and John Goodman seems as good as anyone to proudly boast the suit and glasses, yet the pieces do not fit like they're supposed to. This is more of a tribute film rather than a direct sequel. I'll end this on a rather loose comparison; if the original Blues Brothers film was Hall and Oates, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the Hall and Oates cover band that's biggest gig is open mic night down at the town pub. They may not be too painful, but hell, it just ain't the real thing. Starring: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, J. Evan Bonifant, Joe Morton, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King. Directed by: John Landis.

    It is plain as day that this movie was simply made to ride the coat tails of the original and "hope" and "PRAY" that everyone who loved the original would rush out to see this. I did and this was one of only 2 movies I've EVER walked out of! The other movie I walked out of, The re-release of 'The Original Exorcist'. The only reason I walked out of that movie was because it scared the holy hell out of me. With that said, I guess 'The Blues Brothers 2000' did as well. I love movies. Good, bad, B movies, block busters, I give them all a chance and enjoy with an open mind. This movie was almost an insult to movie goers the world over. And the budget for the film was decent! Almost $30 mil! But turning the blues brothers into zombies? Tossing in a kid for "family appeal"? And a car that is basically like night rider? If you watch this movie at all, do yourself a favor and fast forward to the end. THE ONLY GREAT THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE.... Is the closing Battle Of The Bands. I'm not spoiling anything here. All I will say is the music is great and seeing all those amazing musicians made watching this over again, worth it. But like I said. Just fast forward to the end. For all the amazing movies big Dan has done, he definitely regrets letting his fans down with this pile of steaming Hollywood "hey they loved the original, lets make money with a remake" flop fest.

    Remember Jake and Elwood Blues and their mission from god? Of course you do. Who doesn't love those Blues Brothers and their musical mayhem induced misadventures? This movie is nothing more than an attempt to try and follow up to the original - and it fails. John Landis returns to direct even though some say that his directing career sort of went downhill in the late 80's (specifically some say it was after the accident that killed Vic Morrow and those kids during the filming of Twilight Zone: The Movie) and onto the 90's (although Oscar with Sly Stallone was moderately good - heck Siskel and Ebert both gave it a thumbs-up). Dan Akyroyd returns as writer and star of this movie as Elwood Blues, at the beginning of this movie Elwood is just getting out of prison when he receives news from the Penguin (no, not the Batman villain, the nun from the first movie) that his partner Jake Blues has unfortunately passed away. This is never explained in the movie at all even though in the opening credits it says it is dedicated to the memory of John Belushi as well as to John Candy and Cab Calloway, who also passed away before this movie got made. So Elwood tries to get the rest of the old band together, minus Jake of course. Along the way we meet the new guys: First of which is Mighty Mack played by John Goodman. (Come on Goodman, you're far too good to be in a movie like this). We also meet our Tagalong Kid character who goes by the name Buster. We also meet Cabby who is reluctant to join until he receives a message from above and is instantly transformed into a Blues Brothers band member. The light shines down on him and he seems to be floating for some reason. I'd hate to steal a joke from Film Brain, but.....SYMBOLISM! Next we have some of the zaniest and messed up car chase scenes ever- the chase scenes in the original were truly spectacular but here they're just completely cartoonish. Such as the Bluesmobile being able to go underwater. We get it, the Bluesmobile is an awesome car - it can survive anything. This is completely and utterly insane even by this logic. What? Is it it like Linkara's magic gun or something? Is it possessed ala Christine? After all that nonsense we get to see a few returning cameos mainly by James Brown (r.i.p godfather of soul) and Aretha Franklin. And I admit the musical numbers in this are pretty awesome. There's also a scene where the band go to see a voodoo queen/priestess by the name of Queen Mousette (this scene is later referenced/paid homage to in the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie). So the voodoo priestess asks the band if they know any calapyso songs to which Elwood tells her that the band can play all kinds of musical but to the calalypso part he says no (this is the second time Dan Akyroyd has actually said no when answering a powerful being such as a ghost, deity or sorceress - the first one being in Ghostbusters). Because of this she transforms them into green skinned zombies that sing calapyso songs and I admit, their performance of Funky Nassau is pretty good. But this is just flat out of nowhere. It's like I'm expecting MJ to make an appearance and start dancing along with them (hey...it would be Thriller: The Sequel). And this just comes out of nowhere. So...yeah...it's...a Big Lipped Aligator Moment! Also a few of the band members get turned into stone. Don't tell me Queen Mousette is actually part Gorgon! There are also several scenes in which several more of the ever-growing enemy list for the bad show up including some russians who get turned into mice. There are more wacky car chase scenes, some more musical numbers and Elwood gives a speech which is extremely epic as well as some goofy slapstick including the band getting covered in goo (most likely the same stuff the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man was made out of). And after all this - the band finally get to perform as the movie ends, during the end credits we see a performance by James Brown along with the band. So that was Blues Brothers 2000, and was it any good? Not really. It's pretty iffy overall - the musical numbers are fun and there are some good scenes but most of it is completely weird. Also why doesn't it ever explain the cause of Jake's death? I'm serious. We don't ever get an explanation for this at all. Dan Akyroyd does well but I think even he knows how bad this movie was going to be, as for the other performers - well they did rather well but again....you can't top the original. The movie is okay....but it will never be as good as the original. Maybe i'm looking at this through Nostalgia goggles but i personally believe and know that the original is and always will be the best. Blues Brothers 20000 doesn't hold up well and compared to the original just flat out fails. I give it 2 out of 10 stars and only 1% out of 1000, the music was the only strong point - the rest was just plain weird. I don't recommend seeing this one, instead...just stick to the original movie and you'll be fine.

    If this movie was not a sequel of one of the best cult movies of the past 30+ years, it would just a dumb movie, the fact it is is just an insult to the memory of the original cast members who passed away. I originally saw the movie when it was released on VHS, and rented the movie for $3, in the late 90's, and I felt ripped off beyond belief. I just recently rewatched the movie, and I feel just stupid for doing so. The movie is even worse the second time around. There are no redeeming qualities, or performances, to save the movie, which has a dumbass plot, and is just boring to watch. The whole 'feud' with the russians is like what a 2 year old would do, and shows early on what a disaster the movie is. The ending is pointless, driving off into the horizon with the cops chasing. Seems like no one knew how to end the movie so they went the brainless way out, at least the first movie showed what happens when you fool with the cops, you become the prison band, which made the end of the original excellent. The only thing they could have worked is have James take over John's role, because the explanation of Jake's death is soooo stupid it's insulting. In the trivia to this movie, it says the movie was ranked 4th, out of 25, worst sequels, I would like to know what was worse than this? I would have said it IS the worst. Even giving this movie a "1" seems like a compliment, but they should add a vote of "Avoid at all costs", because this is the case for this flop. I am really disappointed with Dan Ackroyd, he is almost always good, and this movie looks like he was asleep at the wheel.

    So many people regard this movie as horrible because of the original. I loved the original just like everyone else, but I don't completely hate a movie just because of that. Yes, John Belushi had passed on and wasn't able to be in the movie. However, I bet that he would of wanted it to take place. Had he still been alive, I'm sure he would of been one of the first people signed on for it's production. It has a great cast with a light storyline just like the first. Amazing music just like the first. The only thing missing is Mr. Belushi himself, but that is in no way a reason this movie should be voted a 4/10. Believe me, if you liked the first one movie, give this movie a shot. Go into with a care free mind and you will enjoy it just like you did the first. You will want to dance around, just like you did the first. Enjoy!! :)

    as i watched this i assumed that when Dan Aykroyd and John Landis wrote this they didn't worry much about the plot and focused more on the music, because its great! James Brown, Aretha Franklyn and of course the Blues brothers themselves were good, even though there was no John nor Jim Belushi. tons of other performers pop up as well, such as BB King, Erykah Badu, Paul Shaffer, Eric Floyd, Wilson Picket, Blues Traveler, Sam Moore and many others, but don't really add much to the story, which has Elwood (Akroyd) released from prison bringing the band back together one last time, along with new members, to enter a Battle of the bands contest, once again chased by the cops as well as a Russian mafia. It was kinda cool to see some of the old band members have new jobs, Willie has a strip club, Steve and Donald are radio DJS, and so forth, but that doesn't forgive the weak plot, which just rehashed the first movie, and the car chases, while good at first went on a little too long. the acting was OK, Akroyd as Elwood got annoying, John Goodman as Mighty Mac was good, but no John Belushi. Joe Morton was OK as Cab, the cop who turns out to be Curtis's son, and J Evan Bonifant was OK as Buster, an orphan who follows Elwood around. Overall good music, weak plot

    I like John Landis, and I consider Blues Brothers(along with An American Werewolf in London) his best movie. This sequel is one of his weakest sadly, it has its moments, the cinematography and production values are very good, Dan Aykroyd visibly tries to bring some vigour and energy into his role and the music is absolutely top-notch. However, Landis's direction feels a little inexperienced this time around, while the story is a mess, no scratch that the story is almost non-existent and the first half is pretty much a complete re-hash. The script lacks the wit and quirks that were so evident in the original too, while the pace is uneven, mostly too rushed and the energy is severely lacking, almost as if a helium balloon was burst and any energy that went with it was lost. Aykroyd tries hard, but John Goodman(who I like) is wasted with a poor character and bad dialogue. Overall, disappointing but the music is worth a listen so it isn't a complete waste. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    This was stupid on so many levels. Why this was made, no idea. It's not nearly as good as the first Blues Brothers and has pure boredom to entertain you. Just because a boatload of musicians are in here and because Dan Aykroyd is in it, does not make it a Blue Brotehrs movie. The story is retarded, beyond stupid and the poor execution of comedy by trying to have 100 police cars fly over each other in an accident is just lousy to the extreme. It's not funny. It's lame. John Goodman - whom is always fantastic has been greatly wasted in here. This is what basically killed his career. Before this movie, he had a rocking career and after this, well it all went downhill. This movie is bottom of the barrel, not even good enough for a rainy day.

Good, bad, B movies, block busters, I give them all a chance and enjoy with an open mind. This movie was almost an insult to movie goers the world over. And the budget for the film was decent! Almost $30 mil! But turning the blues brothers into zombies? Tossing in a kid for "family appeal"? And a car that is basically like night rider? If you watch this movie at all, do yourself a favor and fast forward to the end. THE ONLY GREAT THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE.... Is the closing Battle Of The Bands. I'm not spoiling anything here. All I will say is the music is great and seeing all those amazing musicians made watching this over again, worth it. But like I said. Just fast forward to the end. For all the amazing movies big Dan has done, he definitely regrets letting his fans down with this pile of steaming Hollywood "hey they loved the original, lets make money with a remake" flop fest.

    Remember Jake and Elwood Blues and their mission from god? Of course you do. Who doesn't love those Blues Brothers and their musical mayhem induced misadventures? This movie is nothing more than an attempt to try and follow up to the original - and it fails. John Landis returns to direct even though some say that his directing career sort of went downhill in the late 80's (specifically some say it was after the accident that killed Vic Morrow and those kids during the filming of Twilight Zone: The Movie) and onto the 90's (although Oscar with Sly Stallone was moderately good - heck Siskel and Ebert both gave it a thumbs-up). Dan Akyroyd returns as writer and star of this movie as Elwood Blues, at the beginning of this movie Elwood is just getting out of prison when he receives news from the Penguin (no, not the Batman villain, the nun from the first movie) that his partner Jake Blues has unfortunately passed away. This is never explained in the movie at all even though in the opening credits it says it is dedicated to the memory of John Belushi as well as to John Candy and Cab Calloway, who also passed away before this movie got made. So Elwood tries to get the rest of the old band together, minus Jake of course. Along the way we meet the new guys: First of which is Mighty Mack played by John Goodman. (Come on Goodman, you're far too good to be in a movie like this). We also meet our Tagalong Kid character who goes by the name Buster. We also meet Cabby who is reluctant to join until he receives a message from above and is instantly transformed into a Blues Brothers band member. The light shines down on him and he seems to be floating for some reason. I'd hate to steal a joke from Film Brain, but.....SYMBOLISM! Next we have some of the zaniest and messed up car chase scenes ever- the chase scenes in the original were truly spectacular but here they're just completely cartoonish. Such as the Bluesmobile being able to go underwater. We get it, the Bluesmobile is an awesome car - it can survive anything. This is completely and utterly insane even by this logic. What? Is it it like Linkara's magic gun or something? Is it possessed ala Christine? After all that nonsense we get to see a few returning cameos mainly by James Brown (r.i.p godfather of soul) and Aretha Franklin. And I admit the musical numbers in this are pretty awesome. There's also a scene where the band go to see a voodoo queen/priestess by the name of Queen Mousette (this scene is later referenced/paid homage to in the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie). So the voodoo priestess asks the band if they know any calapyso songs to which Elwood tells her that the band can play all kinds of musical but to the calalypso part he says no (this is the second time Dan Akyroyd has actually said no when answering a powerful being such as a ghost, deity or sorceress - the first one being in Ghostbusters). Because of this she transforms them into green skinned zombies that sing calapyso songs and I admit, their performance of Funky Nassau is pretty good. But this is just flat out of nowhere. It's like I'm expecting MJ to make an appearance and start dancing along with them (hey...it would be Thriller: The Sequel). And this just comes out of nowhere. So...yeah...it's...a Big Lipped Aligator Moment! Also a few of the band members get turned into stone. Don't tell me Queen Mousette is actually part Gorgon! There are also several scenes in which several more of the ever-growing enemy list for the bad show up including some russians who get turned into mice. There are more wacky car chase scenes, some more musical numbers and Elwood gives a speech which is extremely epic as well as some goofy slapstick including the band getting covered in goo (most likely the same stuff the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man was made out of). And after all this - the band finally get to perform as the movie ends, during the end credits we see a performance by James Brown along with the band. So that was Blues Brothers 2000, and was it any good? Not really. It's pretty iffy overall - the musical numbers are fun and there are some good scenes but most of it is completely weird. Also why doesn't it ever explain the cause of Jake's death? I'm serious. We don't ever get an explanation for this at all. Dan Akyroyd does well but I think even he knows how bad this movie was going to be, as for the other performers - well they did rather well but again....you can't top the original. The movie is okay....but it will never be as good as the original. Maybe i'm looking at this through Nostalgia goggles but i personally believe and know that the original is and always will be the best. Blues Brothers 20000 doesn't hold up well and compared to the original just flat out fails. I give it 2 out of 10 stars and only 1% out of 1000, the music was the only strong point - the rest was just plain weird. I don't recommend seeing this one, instead...just stick to the original movie and you'll be fine.

    If this movie was not a sequel of one of the best cult movies of the past 30+ years, it would just a dumb movie, the fact it is is just an insult to the memory of the original cast members who passed away. I originally saw the movie when it was released on VHS, and rented the movie for $3, in the late 90's, and I felt ripped off beyond belief. I just recently rewatched the movie, and I feel just stupid for doing so. The movie is even worse the second time around. There are no redeeming qualities, or performances, to save the movie, which has a dumbass plot, and is just boring to watch. The whole 'feud' with the russians is like what a 2 year old would do, and shows early on what a disaster the movie is. The ending is pointless, driving off into the horizon with the cops chasing. Seems like no one knew how to end the movie so they went the brainless way out, at least the first movie showed what happens when you fool with the cops, you become the prison band, which made the end of the original excellent. The only thing they could have worked is have James take over John's role, because the explanation of Jake's death is soooo stupid it's insulting. In the trivia to this movie, it says the movie was ranked 4th, out of 25, worst sequels, I would like to know what was worse than this? I would have said it IS the worst. Even giving this movie a "1" seems like a compliment, but they should add a vote of "Avoid at all costs", because this is the case for this flop. I am really disappointed with Dan Ackroyd, he is almost always good, and this movie looks like he was asleep at the wheel.

    So many people regard this movie as horrible because of the original. I loved the original just like everyone else, but I don't completely hate a movie just because of that. Yes, John Belushi had passed on and wasn't able to be in the movie. However, I bet that he would of wanted it to take place. Had he still been alive, I'm sure he would of been one of the first people signed on for it's production. It has a great cast with a light storyline just like the first. Amazing music just like the first. The only thing missing is Mr. Belushi himself, but that is in no way a reason this movie should be voted a 4/10. Believe me, if you liked the first one movie, give this movie a shot. Go into with a care free mind and you will enjoy it just like you did the first. You will want to dance around, just like you did the first. Enjoy!! :)

    as i watched this i assumed that when Dan Aykroyd and John Landis wrote this they didn't worry much about the plot and focused more on the music, because its great! James Brown, Aretha Franklyn and of course the Blues brothers themselves were good, even though there was no John nor Jim Belushi. tons of other performers pop up as well, such as BB King, Erykah Badu, Paul Shaffer, Eric Floyd, Wilson Picket, Blues Traveler, Sam Moore and many others, but don't really add much to the story, which has Elwood (Akroyd) released from prison bringing the band back together one last time, along with new members, to enter a Battle of the bands contest, once again chased by the cops as well as a Russian mafia. It was kinda cool to see some of the old band members have new jobs, Willie has a strip club, Steve and Donald are radio DJS, and so forth, but that doesn't forgive the weak plot, which just rehashed the first movie, and the car chases, while good at first went on a little too long. the acting was OK, Akroyd as Elwood got annoying, John Goodman as Mighty Mac was good, but no John Belushi. Joe Morton was OK as Cab, the cop who turns out to be Curtis's son, and J Evan Bonifant was OK as Buster, an orphan who follows Elwood around. Overall good music, weak plot

    I like John Landis, and I consider Blues Brothers(along with An American Werewolf in London) his best movie. This sequel is one of his weakest sadly, it has its moments, the cinematography and production values are very good, Dan Aykroyd visibly tries to bring some vigour and energy into his role and the music is absolutely top-notch. However, Landis's direction feels a little inexperienced this time around, while the story is a mess, no scratch that the story is almost non-existent and the first half is pretty much a complete re-hash. The script lacks the wit and quirks that were so evident in the original too, while the pace is uneven, mostly too rushed and the energy is severely lacking, almost as if a helium balloon was burst and any energy that went with it was lost. Aykroyd tries hard, but John Goodman(who I like) is wasted with a poor character and bad dialogue. Overall, disappointing but the music is worth a listen so it isn't a complete waste. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    This was stupid on so many levels. Why this was made, no idea. It's not nearly as good as the first Blues Brothers and has pure boredom to entertain you. Just because a boatload of musicians are in here and because Dan Aykroyd is in it, does not make it a Blue Brotehrs movie. The story is retarded, beyond stupid and the poor execution of comedy by trying to have 100 police cars fly over each other in an accident is just lousy to the extreme. It's not funny. It's lame. John Goodman - whom is always fantastic has been greatly wasted in here. This is what basically killed his career. Before this movie, he had a rocking career and after this, well it all went downhill. This movie is bottom of the barrel, not even good enough for a rainy day.

    This directionless and unnecessary sequel sees Dan Aykroyd reforming the old Blues Brothers band, this time with John Goodman, Joe Morton and where-is-he-now child actor J. Evan Bonifant. There's no story, just a series of musical set pieces and car crashes - much like the original movie, only not as good. Too much of the film is devoted to prolonged set-up, very few jokes are funny, and John Landis's direction is hopelessly static. But the music, as before, is fantastic; the concert sequences have an energy sorely lacking in the rest of the film. In the name of full disclosure, there is one terrific scene: a huge pile up in which car after car after car after smash into each other until there's a ridiculously huge pile of tangled metal in the middle of the road. Otherwise, it's missable.

    The whole movie seemed like a throwback/tribute to the original. It didn't really try at all to stand on its own merits, it just came across as an excuse for the cast (most of whom were in the original) to relive the good ole' days. Most of the scenes and plot points mirrored those of the original film. Aside from that, the signature clothing (black suit, black fedora, sunglasses, etc.) and the Bluesmobile, this movie is almost unrecognizable from the original film. Out of the two stars of the original, only Dan Aykroyd survived to make this film. (RIP John Belushi.) Unfortunately, Elwood Blues must have gone to the grave with Jake Blues, because Dan Aykroyd's reprisal of his role is disgraceful. Elwood's voice, accent, mannerisms, and overall attitude have totally changed...for the worse. A once mysterious, serious, resourceful, and charming character has been warped into a worthless goofball, and this change sets the tone for the rest of the movie as well. The original movie, though very funny, had a serious tone to it (at least the performances seemed that way), but Blues Brothers 2000 is just goofy and cheesy. The only thing that I can compare the goofiness/cheesiness to is a kids movie...which makes sense since one of the main characters of this movie IS a kid, "Buster Blues". After visiting The Penguin from the original movie, Elwood gets stuck mentoring an orphan boy, Buster, who turns out to be a blues prodigy. Add John Goodman's equally goofy character, "Mighty" Mack McTeer, into the mix and you've got a recipe for disaster. The only things that saves this movie from being a 0/10 are the outstanding musical sequences (with the exception of Johnny Lang's "contribution"). With the exception of John Belushi, the original band is reunited in this film and they do not disappoint! The Blues Brothers Band and the various cameos from famous musicians throughout the movie are reason enough to watch it. The final sequence, a Battle of the Bands contest, is particularly good. To Summarize: the movie sucks, but the music is great! Watch it at least once, especially if you've seen the original.

    If a sequel to the iconic 1980's film The Blues Brothers needed to be made, I would've much rather seem John Goodman assume the role of Jake Blues, the chubby and talky half of the Blues brothers rather than watch an overlong, padded out tribute film to the group, involving the surviving half of the brothers, Elwood, desperately try to get the old band back together in an effort to keep the blues alive. There is an uncanny stench of desperation from the screen as the obligatory sequel plot takes fold and sadly consumes the iconic trail the original 1980's classic paved. I recall my original review of The Blues Brothers with dread upon viewing its unnecessary sequel. I stated, "there are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them," and conclude with, "The Blues Brothers is a fun, energized comedy that starts fast and rarely lets up in terms of comedy and music. It's a Chicago classic and one of the funniest and smartest musical comedies I have yet to see." The sequel takes all the fun out of its formula and replaces it with wasted energy. There's nothing here that couldn't have been simply put on a soundtrack and left at that. Dan Aykroyd reprises his role as Elwood, as he tries so hard to make new friendships, one of which involving a ten year old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), who he takes along upon learning of his rather somber roots at the orphanage Jake and Elwood were raised in and saved from being demolished in the original film. He learns that Buster has a talent for playing the harmonica and gives him a slick suit and shades to join in the revival band. Elwood also recruits Mack McTeer (played by John Goodman), a bartender from a new strip club he has just found out about, and Cab (Joe Morton), the illegitimate son of an old friend who is initially bitter and cold towards the idea of a band but soon can not refuse. One of the strongest moments is the three minute long musical rendition of Wilson Pickett's "634-5789," about a phone number, when dialed, will connect the lonely caller to attractive women who will provide them with a good time. If only they saw who was really working the phone lines. For every infectious dance sequence we get, we get an endless amount of stale comedy littered with unimpressive jokes and redundant banter. The musical numbers are the saving grace here but, again, that's what soundtracks are for. It's hard to say exactly where Blues Brothers 2000 goes wrong. It seems to have all the working components for a sequel to the original film. It is written by Aykroyd himself and John Landis (who again assumes the director role), two men who should know the material better than any soul, and we can see they desperately tried to work around the deaths of co-workers John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy in order to make a sequel work, and John Goodman seems as good as anyone to proudly boast the suit and glasses, yet the pieces do not fit like they're supposed to. This is more of a tribute film rather than a direct sequel. I'll end this on a rather loose comparison; if the original Blues Brothers film was Hall and Oates, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the Hall and Oates cover band that's biggest gig is open mic night down at the town pub. They may not be too painful, but hell, it just ain't the real thing. Starring: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, J. Evan Bonifant, Joe Morton, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King. Directed by: John Landis.

    It is plain as day that this movie was simply made to ride the coat tails of the original and "hope" and "PRAY" that everyone who loved the original would rush out to see this.

It was kinda cool to see some of the old band members have new jobs, Willie has a strip club, Steve and Donald are radio DJS, and so forth, but that doesn't forgive the weak plot, which just rehashed the first movie, and the car chases, while good at first went on a little too long. the acting was OK, Akroyd as Elwood got annoying, John Goodman as Mighty Mac was good, but no John Belushi. Joe Morton was OK as Cab, the cop who turns out to be Curtis's son, and J Evan Bonifant was OK as Buster, an orphan who follows Elwood around. Overall good music, weak plot

    I like John Landis, and I consider Blues Brothers(along with An American Werewolf in London) his best movie. This sequel is one of his weakest sadly, it has its moments, the cinematography and production values are very good, Dan Aykroyd visibly tries to bring some vigour and energy into his role and the music is absolutely top-notch. However, Landis's direction feels a little inexperienced this time around, while the story is a mess, no scratch that the story is almost non-existent and the first half is pretty much a complete re-hash. The script lacks the wit and quirks that were so evident in the original too, while the pace is uneven, mostly too rushed and the energy is severely lacking, almost as if a helium balloon was burst and any energy that went with it was lost. Aykroyd tries hard, but John Goodman(who I like) is wasted with a poor character and bad dialogue. Overall, disappointing but the music is worth a listen so it isn't a complete waste. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    This was stupid on so many levels. Why this was made, no idea. It's not nearly as good as the first Blues Brothers and has pure boredom to entertain you. Just because a boatload of musicians are in here and because Dan Aykroyd is in it, does not make it a Blue Brotehrs movie. The story is retarded, beyond stupid and the poor execution of comedy by trying to have 100 police cars fly over each other in an accident is just lousy to the extreme. It's not funny. It's lame. John Goodman - whom is always fantastic has been greatly wasted in here. This is what basically killed his career. Before this movie, he had a rocking career and after this, well it all went downhill. This movie is bottom of the barrel, not even good enough for a rainy day.

    This directionless and unnecessary sequel sees Dan Aykroyd reforming the old Blues Brothers band, this time with John Goodman, Joe Morton and where-is-he-now child actor J. Evan Bonifant. There's no story, just a series of musical set pieces and car crashes - much like the original movie, only not as good. Too much of the film is devoted to prolonged set-up, very few jokes are funny, and John Landis's direction is hopelessly static. But the music, as before, is fantastic; the concert sequences have an energy sorely lacking in the rest of the film. In the name of full disclosure, there is one terrific scene: a huge pile up in which car after car after car after smash into each other until there's a ridiculously huge pile of tangled metal in the middle of the road. Otherwise, it's missable.

    The whole movie seemed like a throwback/tribute to the original. It didn't really try at all to stand on its own merits, it just came across as an excuse for the cast (most of whom were in the original) to relive the good ole' days. Most of the scenes and plot points mirrored those of the original film. Aside from that, the signature clothing (black suit, black fedora, sunglasses, etc.) and the Bluesmobile, this movie is almost unrecognizable from the original film. Out of the two stars of the original, only Dan Aykroyd survived to make this film. (RIP John Belushi.) Unfortunately, Elwood Blues must have gone to the grave with Jake Blues, because Dan Aykroyd's reprisal of his role is disgraceful. Elwood's voice, accent, mannerisms, and overall attitude have totally changed...for the worse. A once mysterious, serious, resourceful, and charming character has been warped into a worthless goofball, and this change sets the tone for the rest of the movie as well. The original movie, though very funny, had a serious tone to it (at least the performances seemed that way), but Blues Brothers 2000 is just goofy and cheesy. The only thing that I can compare the goofiness/cheesiness to is a kids movie...which makes sense since one of the main characters of this movie IS a kid, "Buster Blues". After visiting The Penguin from the original movie, Elwood gets stuck mentoring an orphan boy, Buster, who turns out to be a blues prodigy. Add John Goodman's equally goofy character, "Mighty" Mack McTeer, into the mix and you've got a recipe for disaster. The only things that saves this movie from being a 0/10 are the outstanding musical sequences (with the exception of Johnny Lang's "contribution"). With the exception of John Belushi, the original band is reunited in this film and they do not disappoint! The Blues Brothers Band and the various cameos from famous musicians throughout the movie are reason enough to watch it. The final sequence, a Battle of the Bands contest, is particularly good. To Summarize: the movie sucks, but the music is great! Watch it at least once, especially if you've seen the original.

    If a sequel to the iconic 1980's film The Blues Brothers needed to be made, I would've much rather seem John Goodman assume the role of Jake Blues, the chubby and talky half of the Blues brothers rather than watch an overlong, padded out tribute film to the group, involving the surviving half of the brothers, Elwood, desperately try to get the old band back together in an effort to keep the blues alive. There is an uncanny stench of desperation from the screen as the obligatory sequel plot takes fold and sadly consumes the iconic trail the original 1980's classic paved. I recall my original review of The Blues Brothers with dread upon viewing its unnecessary sequel. I stated, "there are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them," and conclude with, "The Blues Brothers is a fun, energized comedy that starts fast and rarely lets up in terms of comedy and music. It's a Chicago classic and one of the funniest and smartest musical comedies I have yet to see." The sequel takes all the fun out of its formula and replaces it with wasted energy. There's nothing here that couldn't have been simply put on a soundtrack and left at that. Dan Aykroyd reprises his role as Elwood, as he tries so hard to make new friendships, one of which involving a ten year old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), who he takes along upon learning of his rather somber roots at the orphanage Jake and Elwood were raised in and saved from being demolished in the original film. He learns that Buster has a talent for playing the harmonica and gives him a slick suit and shades to join in the revival band. Elwood also recruits Mack McTeer (played by John Goodman), a bartender from a new strip club he has just found out about, and Cab (Joe Morton), the illegitimate son of an old friend who is initially bitter and cold towards the idea of a band but soon can not refuse. One of the strongest moments is the three minute long musical rendition of Wilson Pickett's "634-5789," about a phone number, when dialed, will connect the lonely caller to attractive women who will provide them with a good time. If only they saw who was really working the phone lines. For every infectious dance sequence we get, we get an endless amount of stale comedy littered with unimpressive jokes and redundant banter. The musical numbers are the saving grace here but, again, that's what soundtracks are for. It's hard to say exactly where Blues Brothers 2000 goes wrong. It seems to have all the working components for a sequel to the original film. It is written by Aykroyd himself and John Landis (who again assumes the director role), two men who should know the material better than any soul, and we can see they desperately tried to work around the deaths of co-workers John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy in order to make a sequel work, and John Goodman seems as good as anyone to proudly boast the suit and glasses, yet the pieces do not fit like they're supposed to. This is more of a tribute film rather than a direct sequel. I'll end this on a rather loose comparison; if the original Blues Brothers film was Hall and Oates, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the Hall and Oates cover band that's biggest gig is open mic night down at the town pub. They may not be too painful, but hell, it just ain't the real thing. Starring: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, J. Evan Bonifant, Joe Morton, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King. Directed by: John Landis.

    It is plain as day that this movie was simply made to ride the coat tails of the original and "hope" and "PRAY" that everyone who loved the original would rush out to see this. I did and this was one of only 2 movies I've EVER walked out of! The other movie I walked out of, The re-release of 'The Original Exorcist'. The only reason I walked out of that movie was because it scared the holy hell out of me. With that said, I guess 'The Blues Brothers 2000' did as well. I love movies. Good, bad, B movies, block busters, I give them all a chance and enjoy with an open mind. This movie was almost an insult to movie goers the world over. And the budget for the film was decent! Almost $30 mil! But turning the blues brothers into zombies? Tossing in a kid for "family appeal"? And a car that is basically like night rider? If you watch this movie at all, do yourself a favor and fast forward to the end. THE ONLY GREAT THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE.... Is the closing Battle Of The Bands. I'm not spoiling anything here. All I will say is the music is great and seeing all those amazing musicians made watching this over again, worth it. But like I said. Just fast forward to the end. For all the amazing movies big Dan has done, he definitely regrets letting his fans down with this pile of steaming Hollywood "hey they loved the original, lets make money with a remake" flop fest.

    Remember Jake and Elwood Blues and their mission from god? Of course you do. Who doesn't love those Blues Brothers and their musical mayhem induced misadventures? This movie is nothing more than an attempt to try and follow up to the original - and it fails. John Landis returns to direct even though some say that his directing career sort of went downhill in the late 80's (specifically some say it was after the accident that killed Vic Morrow and those kids during the filming of Twilight Zone: The Movie) and onto the 90's (although Oscar with Sly Stallone was moderately good - heck Siskel and Ebert both gave it a thumbs-up). Dan Akyroyd returns as writer and star of this movie as Elwood Blues, at the beginning of this movie Elwood is just getting out of prison when he receives news from the Penguin (no, not the Batman villain, the nun from the first movie) that his partner Jake Blues has unfortunately passed away. This is never explained in the movie at all even though in the opening credits it says it is dedicated to the memory of John Belushi as well as to John Candy and Cab Calloway, who also passed away before this movie got made. So Elwood tries to get the rest of the old band together, minus Jake of course. Along the way we meet the new guys: First of which is Mighty Mack played by John Goodman. (Come on Goodman, you're far too good to be in a movie like this). We also meet our Tagalong Kid character who goes by the name Buster. We also meet Cabby who is reluctant to join until he receives a message from above and is instantly transformed into a Blues Brothers band member. The light shines down on him and he seems to be floating for some reason. I'd hate to steal a joke from Film Brain, but.....SYMBOLISM! Next we have some of the zaniest and messed up car chase scenes ever- the chase scenes in the original were truly spectacular but here they're just completely cartoonish. Such as the Bluesmobile being able to go underwater. We get it, the Bluesmobile is an awesome car - it can survive anything. This is completely and utterly insane even by this logic. What? Is it it like Linkara's magic gun or something? Is it possessed ala Christine? After all that nonsense we get to see a few returning cameos mainly by James Brown (r.i.p godfather of soul) and Aretha Franklin. And I admit the musical numbers in this are pretty awesome. There's also a scene where the band go to see a voodoo queen/priestess by the name of Queen Mousette (this scene is later referenced/paid homage to in the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie). So the voodoo priestess asks the band if they know any calapyso songs to which Elwood tells her that the band can play all kinds of musical but to the calalypso part he says no (this is the second time Dan Akyroyd has actually said no when answering a powerful being such as a ghost, deity or sorceress - the first one being in Ghostbusters). Because of this she transforms them into green skinned zombies that sing calapyso songs and I admit, their performance of Funky Nassau is pretty good. But this is just flat out of nowhere. It's like I'm expecting MJ to make an appearance and start dancing along with them (hey...it would be Thriller: The Sequel). And this just comes out of nowhere. So...yeah...it's...a Big Lipped Aligator Moment! Also a few of the band members get turned into stone. Don't tell me Queen Mousette is actually part Gorgon! There are also several scenes in which several more of the ever-growing enemy list for the bad show up including some russians who get turned into mice. There are more wacky car chase scenes, some more musical numbers and Elwood gives a speech which is extremely epic as well as some goofy slapstick including the band getting covered in goo (most likely the same stuff the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man was made out of). And after all this - the band finally get to perform as the movie ends, during the end credits we see a performance by James Brown along with the band. So that was Blues Brothers 2000, and was it any good? Not really. It's pretty iffy overall - the musical numbers are fun and there are some good scenes but most of it is completely weird. Also why doesn't it ever explain the cause of Jake's death? I'm serious. We don't ever get an explanation for this at all. Dan Akyroyd does well but I think even he knows how bad this movie was going to be, as for the other performers - well they did rather well but again....you can't top the original. The movie is okay....but it will never be as good as the original. Maybe i'm looking at this through Nostalgia goggles but i personally believe and know that the original is and always will be the best. Blues Brothers 20000 doesn't hold up well and compared to the original just flat out fails. I give it 2 out of 10 stars and only 1% out of 1000, the music was the only strong point - the rest was just plain weird. I don't recommend seeing this one, instead...just stick to the original movie and you'll be fine.

    If this movie was not a sequel of one of the best cult movies of the past 30+ years, it would just a dumb movie, the fact it is is just an insult to the memory of the original cast members who passed away. I originally saw the movie when it was released on VHS, and rented the movie for $3, in the late 90's, and I felt ripped off beyond belief. I just recently rewatched the movie, and I feel just stupid for doing so. The movie is even worse the second time around. There are no redeeming qualities, or performances, to save the movie, which has a dumbass plot, and is just boring to watch. The whole 'feud' with the russians is like what a 2 year old would do, and shows early on what a disaster the movie is. The ending is pointless, driving off into the horizon with the cops chasing. Seems like no one knew how to end the movie so they went the brainless way out, at least the first movie showed what happens when you fool with the cops, you become the prison band, which made the end of the original excellent. The only thing they could have worked is have James take over John's role, because the explanation of Jake's death is soooo stupid it's insulting. In the trivia to this movie, it says the movie was ranked 4th, out of 25, worst sequels, I would like to know what was worse than this? I would have said it IS the worst. Even giving this movie a "1" seems like a compliment, but they should add a vote of "Avoid at all costs", because this is the case for this flop. I am really disappointed with Dan Ackroyd, he is almost always good, and this movie looks like he was asleep at the wheel.

    So many people regard this movie as horrible because of the original. I loved the original just like everyone else, but I don't completely hate a movie just because of that. Yes, John Belushi had passed on and wasn't able to be in the movie. However, I bet that he would of wanted it to take place. Had he still been alive, I'm sure he would of been one of the first people signed on for it's production. It has a great cast with a light storyline just like the first. Amazing music just like the first. The only thing missing is Mr. Belushi himself, but that is in no way a reason this movie should be voted a 4/10. Believe me, if you liked the first one movie, give this movie a shot. Go into with a care free mind and you will enjoy it just like you did the first. You will want to dance around, just like you did the first. Enjoy!! :)

I'll end this on a rather loose comparison; if the original Blues Brothers film was Hall and Oates, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the Hall and Oates cover band that's biggest gig is open mic night down at the town pub. They may not be too painful, but hell, it just ain't the real thing. Starring: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, J. Evan Bonifant, Joe Morton, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King. Directed by: John Landis.

    It is plain as day that this movie was simply made to ride the coat tails of the original and "hope" and "PRAY" that everyone who loved the original would rush out to see this. I did and this was one of only 2 movies I've EVER walked out of! The other movie I walked out of, The re-release of 'The Original Exorcist'. The only reason I walked out of that movie was because it scared the holy hell out of me. With that said, I guess 'The Blues Brothers 2000' did as well. I love movies. Good, bad, B movies, block busters, I give them all a chance and enjoy with an open mind. This movie was almost an insult to movie goers the world over. And the budget for the film was decent! Almost $30 mil! But turning the blues brothers into zombies? Tossing in a kid for "family appeal"? And a car that is basically like night rider? If you watch this movie at all, do yourself a favor and fast forward to the end. THE ONLY GREAT THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE.... Is the closing Battle Of The Bands. I'm not spoiling anything here. All I will say is the music is great and seeing all those amazing musicians made watching this over again, worth it. But like I said. Just fast forward to the end. For all the amazing movies big Dan has done, he definitely regrets letting his fans down with this pile of steaming Hollywood "hey they loved the original, lets make money with a remake" flop fest.

    Remember Jake and Elwood Blues and their mission from god? Of course you do. Who doesn't love those Blues Brothers and their musical mayhem induced misadventures? This movie is nothing more than an attempt to try and follow up to the original - and it fails. John Landis returns to direct even though some say that his directing career sort of went downhill in the late 80's (specifically some say it was after the accident that killed Vic Morrow and those kids during the filming of Twilight Zone: The Movie) and onto the 90's (although Oscar with Sly Stallone was moderately good - heck Siskel and Ebert both gave it a thumbs-up). Dan Akyroyd returns as writer and star of this movie as Elwood Blues, at the beginning of this movie Elwood is just getting out of prison when he receives news from the Penguin (no, not the Batman villain, the nun from the first movie) that his partner Jake Blues has unfortunately passed away. This is never explained in the movie at all even though in the opening credits it says it is dedicated to the memory of John Belushi as well as to John Candy and Cab Calloway, who also passed away before this movie got made. So Elwood tries to get the rest of the old band together, minus Jake of course. Along the way we meet the new guys: First of which is Mighty Mack played by John Goodman. (Come on Goodman, you're far too good to be in a movie like this). We also meet our Tagalong Kid character who goes by the name Buster. We also meet Cabby who is reluctant to join until he receives a message from above and is instantly transformed into a Blues Brothers band member. The light shines down on him and he seems to be floating for some reason. I'd hate to steal a joke from Film Brain, but.....SYMBOLISM! Next we have some of the zaniest and messed up car chase scenes ever- the chase scenes in the original were truly spectacular but here they're just completely cartoonish. Such as the Bluesmobile being able to go underwater. We get it, the Bluesmobile is an awesome car - it can survive anything. This is completely and utterly insane even by this logic. What? Is it it like Linkara's magic gun or something? Is it possessed ala Christine? After all that nonsense we get to see a few returning cameos mainly by James Brown (r.i.p godfather of soul) and Aretha Franklin. And I admit the musical numbers in this are pretty awesome. There's also a scene where the band go to see a voodoo queen/priestess by the name of Queen Mousette (this scene is later referenced/paid homage to in the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie). So the voodoo priestess asks the band if they know any calapyso songs to which Elwood tells her that the band can play all kinds of musical but to the calalypso part he says no (this is the second time Dan Akyroyd has actually said no when answering a powerful being such as a ghost, deity or sorceress - the first one being in Ghostbusters). Because of this she transforms them into green skinned zombies that sing calapyso songs and I admit, their performance of Funky Nassau is pretty good. But this is just flat out of nowhere. It's like I'm expecting MJ to make an appearance and start dancing along with them (hey...it would be Thriller: The Sequel). And this just comes out of nowhere. So...yeah...it's...a Big Lipped Aligator Moment! Also a few of the band members get turned into stone. Don't tell me Queen Mousette is actually part Gorgon! There are also several scenes in which several more of the ever-growing enemy list for the bad show up including some russians who get turned into mice. There are more wacky car chase scenes, some more musical numbers and Elwood gives a speech which is extremely epic as well as some goofy slapstick including the band getting covered in goo (most likely the same stuff the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man was made out of). And after all this - the band finally get to perform as the movie ends, during the end credits we see a performance by James Brown along with the band. So that was Blues Brothers 2000, and was it any good? Not really. It's pretty iffy overall - the musical numbers are fun and there are some good scenes but most of it is completely weird. Also why doesn't it ever explain the cause of Jake's death? I'm serious. We don't ever get an explanation for this at all. Dan Akyroyd does well but I think even he knows how bad this movie was going to be, as for the other performers - well they did rather well but again....you can't top the original. The movie is okay....but it will never be as good as the original. Maybe i'm looking at this through Nostalgia goggles but i personally believe and know that the original is and always will be the best. Blues Brothers 20000 doesn't hold up well and compared to the original just flat out fails. I give it 2 out of 10 stars and only 1% out of 1000, the music was the only strong point - the rest was just plain weird. I don't recommend seeing this one, instead...just stick to the original movie and you'll be fine.

    If this movie was not a sequel of one of the best cult movies of the past 30+ years, it would just a dumb movie, the fact it is is just an insult to the memory of the original cast members who passed away. I originally saw the movie when it was released on VHS, and rented the movie for $3, in the late 90's, and I felt ripped off beyond belief. I just recently rewatched the movie, and I feel just stupid for doing so. The movie is even worse the second time around. There are no redeeming qualities, or performances, to save the movie, which has a dumbass plot, and is just boring to watch. The whole 'feud' with the russians is like what a 2 year old would do, and shows early on what a disaster the movie is. The ending is pointless, driving off into the horizon with the cops chasing. Seems like no one knew how to end the movie so they went the brainless way out, at least the first movie showed what happens when you fool with the cops, you become the prison band, which made the end of the original excellent. The only thing they could have worked is have James take over John's role, because the explanation of Jake's death is soooo stupid it's insulting. In the trivia to this movie, it says the movie was ranked 4th, out of 25, worst sequels, I would like to know what was worse than this? I would have said it IS the worst. Even giving this movie a "1" seems like a compliment, but they should add a vote of "Avoid at all costs", because this is the case for this flop. I am really disappointed with Dan Ackroyd, he is almost always good, and this movie looks like he was asleep at the wheel.

    So many people regard this movie as horrible because of the original. I loved the original just like everyone else, but I don't completely hate a movie just because of that. Yes, John Belushi had passed on and wasn't able to be in the movie. However, I bet that he would of wanted it to take place. Had he still been alive, I'm sure he would of been one of the first people signed on for it's production. It has a great cast with a light storyline just like the first. Amazing music just like the first. The only thing missing is Mr. Belushi himself, but that is in no way a reason this movie should be voted a 4/10. Believe me, if you liked the first one movie, give this movie a shot. Go into with a care free mind and you will enjoy it just like you did the first. You will want to dance around, just like you did the first. Enjoy!! :)

    as i watched this i assumed that when Dan Aykroyd and John Landis wrote this they didn't worry much about the plot and focused more on the music, because its great! James Brown, Aretha Franklyn and of course the Blues brothers themselves were good, even though there was no John nor Jim Belushi. tons of other performers pop up as well, such as BB King, Erykah Badu, Paul Shaffer, Eric Floyd, Wilson Picket, Blues Traveler, Sam Moore and many others, but don't really add much to the story, which has Elwood (Akroyd) released from prison bringing the band back together one last time, along with new members, to enter a Battle of the bands contest, once again chased by the cops as well as a Russian mafia. It was kinda cool to see some of the old band members have new jobs, Willie has a strip club, Steve and Donald are radio DJS, and so forth, but that doesn't forgive the weak plot, which just rehashed the first movie, and the car chases, while good at first went on a little too long. the acting was OK, Akroyd as Elwood got annoying, John Goodman as Mighty Mac was good, but no John Belushi. Joe Morton was OK as Cab, the cop who turns out to be Curtis's son, and J Evan Bonifant was OK as Buster, an orphan who follows Elwood around. Overall good music, weak plot

    I like John Landis, and I consider Blues Brothers(along with An American Werewolf in London) his best movie. This sequel is one of his weakest sadly, it has its moments, the cinematography and production values are very good, Dan Aykroyd visibly tries to bring some vigour and energy into his role and the music is absolutely top-notch. However, Landis's direction feels a little inexperienced this time around, while the story is a mess, no scratch that the story is almost non-existent and the first half is pretty much a complete re-hash. The script lacks the wit and quirks that were so evident in the original too, while the pace is uneven, mostly too rushed and the energy is severely lacking, almost as if a helium balloon was burst and any energy that went with it was lost. Aykroyd tries hard, but John Goodman(who I like) is wasted with a poor character and bad dialogue. Overall, disappointing but the music is worth a listen so it isn't a complete waste. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    This was stupid on so many levels. Why this was made, no idea. It's not nearly as good as the first Blues Brothers and has pure boredom to entertain you. Just because a boatload of musicians are in here and because Dan Aykroyd is in it, does not make it a Blue Brotehrs movie. The story is retarded, beyond stupid and the poor execution of comedy by trying to have 100 police cars fly over each other in an accident is just lousy to the extreme. It's not funny. It's lame. John Goodman - whom is always fantastic has been greatly wasted in here. This is what basically killed his career. Before this movie, he had a rocking career and after this, well it all went downhill. This movie is bottom of the barrel, not even good enough for a rainy day.

    This directionless and unnecessary sequel sees Dan Aykroyd reforming the old Blues Brothers band, this time with John Goodman, Joe Morton and where-is-he-now child actor J. Evan Bonifant. There's no story, just a series of musical set pieces and car crashes - much like the original movie, only not as good. Too much of the film is devoted to prolonged set-up, very few jokes are funny, and John Landis's direction is hopelessly static. But the music, as before, is fantastic; the concert sequences have an energy sorely lacking in the rest of the film. In the name of full disclosure, there is one terrific scene: a huge pile up in which car after car after car after smash into each other until there's a ridiculously huge pile of tangled metal in the middle of the road. Otherwise, it's missable.

    The whole movie seemed like a throwback/tribute to the original. It didn't really try at all to stand on its own merits, it just came across as an excuse for the cast (most of whom were in the original) to relive the good ole' days. Most of the scenes and plot points mirrored those of the original film. Aside from that, the signature clothing (black suit, black fedora, sunglasses, etc.) and the Bluesmobile, this movie is almost unrecognizable from the original film. Out of the two stars of the original, only Dan Aykroyd survived to make this film. (RIP John Belushi.) Unfortunately, Elwood Blues must have gone to the grave with Jake Blues, because Dan Aykroyd's reprisal of his role is disgraceful. Elwood's voice, accent, mannerisms, and overall attitude have totally changed...for the worse. A once mysterious, serious, resourceful, and charming character has been warped into a worthless goofball, and this change sets the tone for the rest of the movie as well. The original movie, though very funny, had a serious tone to it (at least the performances seemed that way), but Blues Brothers 2000 is just goofy and cheesy. The only thing that I can compare the goofiness/cheesiness to is a kids movie...which makes sense since one of the main characters of this movie IS a kid, "Buster Blues". After visiting The Penguin from the original movie, Elwood gets stuck mentoring an orphan boy, Buster, who turns out to be a blues prodigy. Add John Goodman's equally goofy character, "Mighty" Mack McTeer, into the mix and you've got a recipe for disaster. The only things that saves this movie from being a 0/10 are the outstanding musical sequences (with the exception of Johnny Lang's "contribution"). With the exception of John Belushi, the original band is reunited in this film and they do not disappoint! The Blues Brothers Band and the various cameos from famous musicians throughout the movie are reason enough to watch it. The final sequence, a Battle of the Bands contest, is particularly good. To Summarize: the movie sucks, but the music is great! Watch it at least once, especially if you've seen the original.

    If a sequel to the iconic 1980's film The Blues Brothers needed to be made, I would've much rather seem John Goodman assume the role of Jake Blues, the chubby and talky half of the Blues brothers rather than watch an overlong, padded out tribute film to the group, involving the surviving half of the brothers, Elwood, desperately try to get the old band back together in an effort to keep the blues alive. There is an uncanny stench of desperation from the screen as the obligatory sequel plot takes fold and sadly consumes the iconic trail the original 1980's classic paved. I recall my original review of The Blues Brothers with dread upon viewing its unnecessary sequel. I stated, "there are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them," and conclude with, "The Blues Brothers is a fun, energized comedy that starts fast and rarely lets up in terms of comedy and music. It's a Chicago classic and one of the funniest and smartest musical comedies I have yet to see." The sequel takes all the fun out of its formula and replaces it with wasted energy. There's nothing here that couldn't have been simply put on a soundtrack and left at that. Dan Aykroyd reprises his role as Elwood, as he tries so hard to make new friendships, one of which involving a ten year old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), who he takes along upon learning of his rather somber roots at the orphanage Jake and Elwood were raised in and saved from being demolished in the original film. He learns that Buster has a talent for playing the harmonica and gives him a slick suit and shades to join in the revival band. Elwood also recruits Mack McTeer (played by John Goodman), a bartender from a new strip club he has just found out about, and Cab (Joe Morton), the illegitimate son of an old friend who is initially bitter and cold towards the idea of a band but soon can not refuse. One of the strongest moments is the three minute long musical rendition of Wilson Pickett's "634-5789," about a phone number, when dialed, will connect the lonely caller to attractive women who will provide them with a good time. If only they saw who was really working the phone lines. For every infectious dance sequence we get, we get an endless amount of stale comedy littered with unimpressive jokes and redundant banter. The musical numbers are the saving grace here but, again, that's what soundtracks are for. It's hard to say exactly where Blues Brothers 2000 goes wrong. It seems to have all the working components for a sequel to the original film. It is written by Aykroyd himself and John Landis (who again assumes the director role), two men who should know the material better than any soul, and we can see they desperately tried to work around the deaths of co-workers John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy in order to make a sequel work, and John Goodman seems as good as anyone to proudly boast the suit and glasses, yet the pieces do not fit like they're supposed to. This is more of a tribute film rather than a direct sequel. I'll end this on a rather loose comparison; if the original Blues Brothers film was Hall and Oates, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the Hall and Oates cover band that's biggest gig is open mic night down at the town pub. They may not be too painful, but hell, it just ain't the real thing. Starring: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, J. Evan Bonifant, Joe Morton, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King. Directed by: John Landis.

Amazing music just like the first. The only thing missing is Mr. Belushi himself, but that is in no way a reason this movie should be voted a 4/10. Believe me, if you liked the first one movie, give this movie a shot. Go into with a care free mind and you will enjoy it just like you did the first. You will want to dance around, just like you did the first. Enjoy!! :)

    as i watched this i assumed that when Dan Aykroyd and John Landis wrote this they didn't worry much about the plot and focused more on the music, because its great! James Brown, Aretha Franklyn and of course the Blues brothers themselves were good, even though there was no John nor Jim Belushi. tons of other performers pop up as well, such as BB King, Erykah Badu, Paul Shaffer, Eric Floyd, Wilson Picket, Blues Traveler, Sam Moore and many others, but don't really add much to the story, which has Elwood (Akroyd) released from prison bringing the band back together one last time, along with new members, to enter a Battle of the bands contest, once again chased by the cops as well as a Russian mafia. It was kinda cool to see some of the old band members have new jobs, Willie has a strip club, Steve and Donald are radio DJS, and so forth, but that doesn't forgive the weak plot, which just rehashed the first movie, and the car chases, while good at first went on a little too long. the acting was OK, Akroyd as Elwood got annoying, John Goodman as Mighty Mac was good, but no John Belushi. Joe Morton was OK as Cab, the cop who turns out to be Curtis's son, and J Evan Bonifant was OK as Buster, an orphan who follows Elwood around. Overall good music, weak plot

    I like John Landis, and I consider Blues Brothers(along with An American Werewolf in London) his best movie. This sequel is one of his weakest sadly, it has its moments, the cinematography and production values are very good, Dan Aykroyd visibly tries to bring some vigour and energy into his role and the music is absolutely top-notch. However, Landis's direction feels a little inexperienced this time around, while the story is a mess, no scratch that the story is almost non-existent and the first half is pretty much a complete re-hash. The script lacks the wit and quirks that were so evident in the original too, while the pace is uneven, mostly too rushed and the energy is severely lacking, almost as if a helium balloon was burst and any energy that went with it was lost. Aykroyd tries hard, but John Goodman(who I like) is wasted with a poor character and bad dialogue. Overall, disappointing but the music is worth a listen so it isn't a complete waste. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    This was stupid on so many levels. Why this was made, no idea. It's not nearly as good as the first Blues Brothers and has pure boredom to entertain you. Just because a boatload of musicians are in here and because Dan Aykroyd is in it, does not make it a Blue Brotehrs movie. The story is retarded, beyond stupid and the poor execution of comedy by trying to have 100 police cars fly over each other in an accident is just lousy to the extreme. It's not funny. It's lame. John Goodman - whom is always fantastic has been greatly wasted in here. This is what basically killed his career. Before this movie, he had a rocking career and after this, well it all went downhill. This movie is bottom of the barrel, not even good enough for a rainy day.

    This directionless and unnecessary sequel sees Dan Aykroyd reforming the old Blues Brothers band, this time with John Goodman, Joe Morton and where-is-he-now child actor J. Evan Bonifant. There's no story, just a series of musical set pieces and car crashes - much like the original movie, only not as good. Too much of the film is devoted to prolonged set-up, very few jokes are funny, and John Landis's direction is hopelessly static. But the music, as before, is fantastic; the concert sequences have an energy sorely lacking in the rest of the film. In the name of full disclosure, there is one terrific scene: a huge pile up in which car after car after car after smash into each other until there's a ridiculously huge pile of tangled metal in the middle of the road. Otherwise, it's missable.

    The whole movie seemed like a throwback/tribute to the original. It didn't really try at all to stand on its own merits, it just came across as an excuse for the cast (most of whom were in the original) to relive the good ole' days. Most of the scenes and plot points mirrored those of the original film. Aside from that, the signature clothing (black suit, black fedora, sunglasses, etc.) and the Bluesmobile, this movie is almost unrecognizable from the original film. Out of the two stars of the original, only Dan Aykroyd survived to make this film. (RIP John Belushi.) Unfortunately, Elwood Blues must have gone to the grave with Jake Blues, because Dan Aykroyd's reprisal of his role is disgraceful. Elwood's voice, accent, mannerisms, and overall attitude have totally changed...for the worse. A once mysterious, serious, resourceful, and charming character has been warped into a worthless goofball, and this change sets the tone for the rest of the movie as well. The original movie, though very funny, had a serious tone to it (at least the performances seemed that way), but Blues Brothers 2000 is just goofy and cheesy. The only thing that I can compare the goofiness/cheesiness to is a kids movie...which makes sense since one of the main characters of this movie IS a kid, "Buster Blues". After visiting The Penguin from the original movie, Elwood gets stuck mentoring an orphan boy, Buster, who turns out to be a blues prodigy. Add John Goodman's equally goofy character, "Mighty" Mack McTeer, into the mix and you've got a recipe for disaster. The only things that saves this movie from being a 0/10 are the outstanding musical sequences (with the exception of Johnny Lang's "contribution"). With the exception of John Belushi, the original band is reunited in this film and they do not disappoint! The Blues Brothers Band and the various cameos from famous musicians throughout the movie are reason enough to watch it. The final sequence, a Battle of the Bands contest, is particularly good. To Summarize: the movie sucks, but the music is great! Watch it at least once, especially if you've seen the original.

    If a sequel to the iconic 1980's film The Blues Brothers needed to be made, I would've much rather seem John Goodman assume the role of Jake Blues, the chubby and talky half of the Blues brothers rather than watch an overlong, padded out tribute film to the group, involving the surviving half of the brothers, Elwood, desperately try to get the old band back together in an effort to keep the blues alive. There is an uncanny stench of desperation from the screen as the obligatory sequel plot takes fold and sadly consumes the iconic trail the original 1980's classic paved. I recall my original review of The Blues Brothers with dread upon viewing its unnecessary sequel. I stated, "there are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them," and conclude with, "The Blues Brothers is a fun, energized comedy that starts fast and rarely lets up in terms of comedy and music. It's a Chicago classic and one of the funniest and smartest musical comedies I have yet to see." The sequel takes all the fun out of its formula and replaces it with wasted energy. There's nothing here that couldn't have been simply put on a soundtrack and left at that. Dan Aykroyd reprises his role as Elwood, as he tries so hard to make new friendships, one of which involving a ten year old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), who he takes along upon learning of his rather somber roots at the orphanage Jake and Elwood were raised in and saved from being demolished in the original film. He learns that Buster has a talent for playing the harmonica and gives him a slick suit and shades to join in the revival band. Elwood also recruits Mack McTeer (played by John Goodman), a bartender from a new strip club he has just found out about, and Cab (Joe Morton), the illegitimate son of an old friend who is initially bitter and cold towards the idea of a band but soon can not refuse. One of the strongest moments is the three minute long musical rendition of Wilson Pickett's "634-5789," about a phone number, when dialed, will connect the lonely caller to attractive women who will provide them with a good time. If only they saw who was really working the phone lines. For every infectious dance sequence we get, we get an endless amount of stale comedy littered with unimpressive jokes and redundant banter. The musical numbers are the saving grace here but, again, that's what soundtracks are for. It's hard to say exactly where Blues Brothers 2000 goes wrong. It seems to have all the working components for a sequel to the original film. It is written by Aykroyd himself and John Landis (who again assumes the director role), two men who should know the material better than any soul, and we can see they desperately tried to work around the deaths of co-workers John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy in order to make a sequel work, and John Goodman seems as good as anyone to proudly boast the suit and glasses, yet the pieces do not fit like they're supposed to. This is more of a tribute film rather than a direct sequel. I'll end this on a rather loose comparison; if the original Blues Brothers film was Hall and Oates, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the Hall and Oates cover band that's biggest gig is open mic night down at the town pub. They may not be too painful, but hell, it just ain't the real thing. Starring: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, J. Evan Bonifant, Joe Morton, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King. Directed by: John Landis.

    It is plain as day that this movie was simply made to ride the coat tails of the original and "hope" and "PRAY" that everyone who loved the original would rush out to see this. I did and this was one of only 2 movies I've EVER walked out of! The other movie I walked out of, The re-release of 'The Original Exorcist'. The only reason I walked out of that movie was because it scared the holy hell out of me. With that said, I guess 'The Blues Brothers 2000' did as well. I love movies. Good, bad, B movies, block busters, I give them all a chance and enjoy with an open mind. This movie was almost an insult to movie goers the world over. And the budget for the film was decent! Almost $30 mil! But turning the blues brothers into zombies? Tossing in a kid for "family appeal"? And a car that is basically like night rider? If you watch this movie at all, do yourself a favor and fast forward to the end. THE ONLY GREAT THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE.... Is the closing Battle Of The Bands. I'm not spoiling anything here. All I will say is the music is great and seeing all those amazing musicians made watching this over again, worth it. But like I said. Just fast forward to the end. For all the amazing movies big Dan has done, he definitely regrets letting his fans down with this pile of steaming Hollywood "hey they loved the original, lets make money with a remake" flop fest.

    Remember Jake and Elwood Blues and their mission from god? Of course you do. Who doesn't love those Blues Brothers and their musical mayhem induced misadventures? This movie is nothing more than an attempt to try and follow up to the original - and it fails. John Landis returns to direct even though some say that his directing career sort of went downhill in the late 80's (specifically some say it was after the accident that killed Vic Morrow and those kids during the filming of Twilight Zone: The Movie) and onto the 90's (although Oscar with Sly Stallone was moderately good - heck Siskel and Ebert both gave it a thumbs-up). Dan Akyroyd returns as writer and star of this movie as Elwood Blues, at the beginning of this movie Elwood is just getting out of prison when he receives news from the Penguin (no, not the Batman villain, the nun from the first movie) that his partner Jake Blues has unfortunately passed away. This is never explained in the movie at all even though in the opening credits it says it is dedicated to the memory of John Belushi as well as to John Candy and Cab Calloway, who also passed away before this movie got made. So Elwood tries to get the rest of the old band together, minus Jake of course. Along the way we meet the new guys: First of which is Mighty Mack played by John Goodman. (Come on Goodman, you're far too good to be in a movie like this). We also meet our Tagalong Kid character who goes by the name Buster. We also meet Cabby who is reluctant to join until he receives a message from above and is instantly transformed into a Blues Brothers band member. The light shines down on him and he seems to be floating for some reason. I'd hate to steal a joke from Film Brain, but.....SYMBOLISM! Next we have some of the zaniest and messed up car chase scenes ever- the chase scenes in the original were truly spectacular but here they're just completely cartoonish. Such as the Bluesmobile being able to go underwater. We get it, the Bluesmobile is an awesome car - it can survive anything. This is completely and utterly insane even by this logic. What? Is it it like Linkara's magic gun or something? Is it possessed ala Christine? After all that nonsense we get to see a few returning cameos mainly by James Brown (r.i.p godfather of soul) and Aretha Franklin. And I admit the musical numbers in this are pretty awesome. There's also a scene where the band go to see a voodoo queen/priestess by the name of Queen Mousette (this scene is later referenced/paid homage to in the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie). So the voodoo priestess asks the band if they know any calapyso songs to which Elwood tells her that the band can play all kinds of musical but to the calalypso part he says no (this is the second time Dan Akyroyd has actually said no when answering a powerful being such as a ghost, deity or sorceress - the first one being in Ghostbusters). Because of this she transforms them into green skinned zombies that sing calapyso songs and I admit, their performance of Funky Nassau is pretty good. But this is just flat out of nowhere. It's like I'm expecting MJ to make an appearance and start dancing along with them (hey...it would be Thriller: The Sequel). And this just comes out of nowhere. So...yeah...it's...a Big Lipped Aligator Moment! Also a few of the band members get turned into stone. Don't tell me Queen Mousette is actually part Gorgon! There are also several scenes in which several more of the ever-growing enemy list for the bad show up including some russians who get turned into mice. There are more wacky car chase scenes, some more musical numbers and Elwood gives a speech which is extremely epic as well as some goofy slapstick including the band getting covered in goo (most likely the same stuff the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man was made out of). And after all this - the band finally get to perform as the movie ends, during the end credits we see a performance by James Brown along with the band. So that was Blues Brothers 2000, and was it any good? Not really. It's pretty iffy overall - the musical numbers are fun and there are some good scenes but most of it is completely weird. Also why doesn't it ever explain the cause of Jake's death? I'm serious. We don't ever get an explanation for this at all. Dan Akyroyd does well but I think even he knows how bad this movie was going to be, as for the other performers - well they did rather well but again....you can't top the original. The movie is okay....but it will never be as good as the original. Maybe i'm looking at this through Nostalgia goggles but i personally believe and know that the original is and always will be the best. Blues Brothers 20000 doesn't hold up well and compared to the original just flat out fails. I give it 2 out of 10 stars and only 1% out of 1000, the music was the only strong point - the rest was just plain weird. I don't recommend seeing this one, instead...just stick to the original movie and you'll be fine.

    If this movie was not a sequel of one of the best cult movies of the past 30+ years, it would just a dumb movie, the fact it is is just an insult to the memory of the original cast members who passed away. I originally saw the movie when it was released on VHS, and rented the movie for $3, in the late 90's, and I felt ripped off beyond belief. I just recently rewatched the movie, and I feel just stupid for doing so. The movie is even worse the second time around. There are no redeeming qualities, or performances, to save the movie, which has a dumbass plot, and is just boring to watch. The whole 'feud' with the russians is like what a 2 year old would do, and shows early on what a disaster the movie is. The ending is pointless, driving off into the horizon with the cops chasing. Seems like no one knew how to end the movie so they went the brainless way out, at least the first movie showed what happens when you fool with the cops, you become the prison band, which made the end of the original excellent. The only thing they could have worked is have James take over John's role, because the explanation of Jake's death is soooo stupid it's insulting. In the trivia to this movie, it says the movie was ranked 4th, out of 25, worst sequels, I would like to know what was worse than this? I would have said it IS the worst. Even giving this movie a "1" seems like a compliment, but they should add a vote of "Avoid at all costs", because this is the case for this flop. I am really disappointed with Dan Ackroyd, he is almost always good, and this movie looks like he was asleep at the wheel.

One of the strongest moments is the three minute long musical rendition of Wilson Pickett's "634-5789," about a phone number, when dialed, will connect the lonely caller to attractive women who will provide them with a good time. If only they saw who was really working the phone lines. For every infectious dance sequence we get, we get an endless amount of stale comedy littered with unimpressive jokes and redundant banter. The musical numbers are the saving grace here but, again, that's what soundtracks are for. It's hard to say exactly where Blues Brothers 2000 goes wrong. It seems to have all the working components for a sequel to the original film. It is written by Aykroyd himself and John Landis (who again assumes the director role), two men who should know the material better than any soul, and we can see they desperately tried to work around the deaths of co-workers John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy in order to make a sequel work, and John Goodman seems as good as anyone to proudly boast the suit and glasses, yet the pieces do not fit like they're supposed to. This is more of a tribute film rather than a direct sequel. I'll end this on a rather loose comparison; if the original Blues Brothers film was Hall and Oates, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the Hall and Oates cover band that's biggest gig is open mic night down at the town pub. They may not be too painful, but hell, it just ain't the real thing. Starring: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, J. Evan Bonifant, Joe Morton, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King. Directed by: John Landis.

    It is plain as day that this movie was simply made to ride the coat tails of the original and "hope" and "PRAY" that everyone who loved the original would rush out to see this. I did and this was one of only 2 movies I've EVER walked out of! The other movie I walked out of, The re-release of 'The Original Exorcist'. The only reason I walked out of that movie was because it scared the holy hell out of me. With that said, I guess 'The Blues Brothers 2000' did as well. I love movies. Good, bad, B movies, block busters, I give them all a chance and enjoy with an open mind. This movie was almost an insult to movie goers the world over. And the budget for the film was decent! Almost $30 mil! But turning the blues brothers into zombies? Tossing in a kid for "family appeal"? And a car that is basically like night rider? If you watch this movie at all, do yourself a favor and fast forward to the end. THE ONLY GREAT THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE.... Is the closing Battle Of The Bands. I'm not spoiling anything here. All I will say is the music is great and seeing all those amazing musicians made watching this over again, worth it. But like I said. Just fast forward to the end. For all the amazing movies big Dan has done, he definitely regrets letting his fans down with this pile of steaming Hollywood "hey they loved the original, lets make money with a remake" flop fest.

    Remember Jake and Elwood Blues and their mission from god? Of course you do. Who doesn't love those Blues Brothers and their musical mayhem induced misadventures? This movie is nothing more than an attempt to try and follow up to the original - and it fails. John Landis returns to direct even though some say that his directing career sort of went downhill in the late 80's (specifically some say it was after the accident that killed Vic Morrow and those kids during the filming of Twilight Zone: The Movie) and onto the 90's (although Oscar with Sly Stallone was moderately good - heck Siskel and Ebert both gave it a thumbs-up). Dan Akyroyd returns as writer and star of this movie as Elwood Blues, at the beginning of this movie Elwood is just getting out of prison when he receives news from the Penguin (no, not the Batman villain, the nun from the first movie) that his partner Jake Blues has unfortunately passed away. This is never explained in the movie at all even though in the opening credits it says it is dedicated to the memory of John Belushi as well as to John Candy and Cab Calloway, who also passed away before this movie got made. So Elwood tries to get the rest of the old band together, minus Jake of course. Along the way we meet the new guys: First of which is Mighty Mack played by John Goodman. (Come on Goodman, you're far too good to be in a movie like this). We also meet our Tagalong Kid character who goes by the name Buster. We also meet Cabby who is reluctant to join until he receives a message from above and is instantly transformed into a Blues Brothers band member. The light shines down on him and he seems to be floating for some reason. I'd hate to steal a joke from Film Brain, but.....SYMBOLISM! Next we have some of the zaniest and messed up car chase scenes ever- the chase scenes in the original were truly spectacular but here they're just completely cartoonish. Such as the Bluesmobile being able to go underwater. We get it, the Bluesmobile is an awesome car - it can survive anything. This is completely and utterly insane even by this logic. What? Is it it like Linkara's magic gun or something? Is it possessed ala Christine? After all that nonsense we get to see a few returning cameos mainly by James Brown (r.i.p godfather of soul) and Aretha Franklin. And I admit the musical numbers in this are pretty awesome. There's also a scene where the band go to see a voodoo queen/priestess by the name of Queen Mousette (this scene is later referenced/paid homage to in the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie). So the voodoo priestess asks the band if they know any calapyso songs to which Elwood tells her that the band can play all kinds of musical but to the calalypso part he says no (this is the second time Dan Akyroyd has actually said no when answering a powerful being such as a ghost, deity or sorceress - the first one being in Ghostbusters). Because of this she transforms them into green skinned zombies that sing calapyso songs and I admit, their performance of Funky Nassau is pretty good. But this is just flat out of nowhere. It's like I'm expecting MJ to make an appearance and start dancing along with them (hey...it would be Thriller: The Sequel). And this just comes out of nowhere. So...yeah...it's...a Big Lipped Aligator Moment! Also a few of the band members get turned into stone. Don't tell me Queen Mousette is actually part Gorgon! There are also several scenes in which several more of the ever-growing enemy list for the bad show up including some russians who get turned into mice. There are more wacky car chase scenes, some more musical numbers and Elwood gives a speech which is extremely epic as well as some goofy slapstick including the band getting covered in goo (most likely the same stuff the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man was made out of). And after all this - the band finally get to perform as the movie ends, during the end credits we see a performance by James Brown along with the band. So that was Blues Brothers 2000, and was it any good? Not really. It's pretty iffy overall - the musical numbers are fun and there are some good scenes but most of it is completely weird. Also why doesn't it ever explain the cause of Jake's death? I'm serious. We don't ever get an explanation for this at all. Dan Akyroyd does well but I think even he knows how bad this movie was going to be, as for the other performers - well they did rather well but again....you can't top the original. The movie is okay....but it will never be as good as the original. Maybe i'm looking at this through Nostalgia goggles but i personally believe and know that the original is and always will be the best. Blues Brothers 20000 doesn't hold up well and compared to the original just flat out fails. I give it 2 out of 10 stars and only 1% out of 1000, the music was the only strong point - the rest was just plain weird. I don't recommend seeing this one, instead...just stick to the original movie and you'll be fine.

    If this movie was not a sequel of one of the best cult movies of the past 30+ years, it would just a dumb movie, the fact it is is just an insult to the memory of the original cast members who passed away. I originally saw the movie when it was released on VHS, and rented the movie for $3, in the late 90's, and I felt ripped off beyond belief. I just recently rewatched the movie, and I feel just stupid for doing so. The movie is even worse the second time around. There are no redeeming qualities, or performances, to save the movie, which has a dumbass plot, and is just boring to watch. The whole 'feud' with the russians is like what a 2 year old would do, and shows early on what a disaster the movie is. The ending is pointless, driving off into the horizon with the cops chasing. Seems like no one knew how to end the movie so they went the brainless way out, at least the first movie showed what happens when you fool with the cops, you become the prison band, which made the end of the original excellent. The only thing they could have worked is have James take over John's role, because the explanation of Jake's death is soooo stupid it's insulting. In the trivia to this movie, it says the movie was ranked 4th, out of 25, worst sequels, I would like to know what was worse than this? I would have said it IS the worst. Even giving this movie a "1" seems like a compliment, but they should add a vote of "Avoid at all costs", because this is the case for this flop. I am really disappointed with Dan Ackroyd, he is almost always good, and this movie looks like he was asleep at the wheel.

    So many people regard this movie as horrible because of the original. I loved the original just like everyone else, but I don't completely hate a movie just because of that. Yes, John Belushi had passed on and wasn't able to be in the movie. However, I bet that he would of wanted it to take place. Had he still been alive, I'm sure he would of been one of the first people signed on for it's production. It has a great cast with a light storyline just like the first. Amazing music just like the first. The only thing missing is Mr. Belushi himself, but that is in no way a reason this movie should be voted a 4/10. Believe me, if you liked the first one movie, give this movie a shot. Go into with a care free mind and you will enjoy it just like you did the first. You will want to dance around, just like you did the first. Enjoy!! :)

    as i watched this i assumed that when Dan Aykroyd and John Landis wrote this they didn't worry much about the plot and focused more on the music, because its great! James Brown, Aretha Franklyn and of course the Blues brothers themselves were good, even though there was no John nor Jim Belushi. tons of other performers pop up as well, such as BB King, Erykah Badu, Paul Shaffer, Eric Floyd, Wilson Picket, Blues Traveler, Sam Moore and many others, but don't really add much to the story, which has Elwood (Akroyd) released from prison bringing the band back together one last time, along with new members, to enter a Battle of the bands contest, once again chased by the cops as well as a Russian mafia. It was kinda cool to see some of the old band members have new jobs, Willie has a strip club, Steve and Donald are radio DJS, and so forth, but that doesn't forgive the weak plot, which just rehashed the first movie, and the car chases, while good at first went on a little too long. the acting was OK, Akroyd as Elwood got annoying, John Goodman as Mighty Mac was good, but no John Belushi. Joe Morton was OK as Cab, the cop who turns out to be Curtis's son, and J Evan Bonifant was OK as Buster, an orphan who follows Elwood around. Overall good music, weak plot

    I like John Landis, and I consider Blues Brothers(along with An American Werewolf in London) his best movie. This sequel is one of his weakest sadly, it has its moments, the cinematography and production values are very good, Dan Aykroyd visibly tries to bring some vigour and energy into his role and the music is absolutely top-notch. However, Landis's direction feels a little inexperienced this time around, while the story is a mess, no scratch that the story is almost non-existent and the first half is pretty much a complete re-hash. The script lacks the wit and quirks that were so evident in the original too, while the pace is uneven, mostly too rushed and the energy is severely lacking, almost as if a helium balloon was burst and any energy that went with it was lost. Aykroyd tries hard, but John Goodman(who I like) is wasted with a poor character and bad dialogue. Overall, disappointing but the music is worth a listen so it isn't a complete waste. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    This was stupid on so many levels. Why this was made, no idea. It's not nearly as good as the first Blues Brothers and has pure boredom to entertain you. Just because a boatload of musicians are in here and because Dan Aykroyd is in it, does not make it a Blue Brotehrs movie. The story is retarded, beyond stupid and the poor execution of comedy by trying to have 100 police cars fly over each other in an accident is just lousy to the extreme. It's not funny. It's lame. John Goodman - whom is always fantastic has been greatly wasted in here. This is what basically killed his career. Before this movie, he had a rocking career and after this, well it all went downhill. This movie is bottom of the barrel, not even good enough for a rainy day.

    This directionless and unnecessary sequel sees Dan Aykroyd reforming the old Blues Brothers band, this time with John Goodman, Joe Morton and where-is-he-now child actor J. Evan Bonifant. There's no story, just a series of musical set pieces and car crashes - much like the original movie, only not as good. Too much of the film is devoted to prolonged set-up, very few jokes are funny, and John Landis's direction is hopelessly static. But the music, as before, is fantastic; the concert sequences have an energy sorely lacking in the rest of the film. In the name of full disclosure, there is one terrific scene: a huge pile up in which car after car after car after smash into each other until there's a ridiculously huge pile of tangled metal in the middle of the road. Otherwise, it's missable.

    The whole movie seemed like a throwback/tribute to the original. It didn't really try at all to stand on its own merits, it just came across as an excuse for the cast (most of whom were in the original) to relive the good ole' days. Most of the scenes and plot points mirrored those of the original film. Aside from that, the signature clothing (black suit, black fedora, sunglasses, etc.) and the Bluesmobile, this movie is almost unrecognizable from the original film. Out of the two stars of the original, only Dan Aykroyd survived to make this film. (RIP John Belushi.) Unfortunately, Elwood Blues must have gone to the grave with Jake Blues, because Dan Aykroyd's reprisal of his role is disgraceful. Elwood's voice, accent, mannerisms, and overall attitude have totally changed...for the worse. A once mysterious, serious, resourceful, and charming character has been warped into a worthless goofball, and this change sets the tone for the rest of the movie as well. The original movie, though very funny, had a serious tone to it (at least the performances seemed that way), but Blues Brothers 2000 is just goofy and cheesy. The only thing that I can compare the goofiness/cheesiness to is a kids movie...which makes sense since one of the main characters of this movie IS a kid, "Buster Blues". After visiting The Penguin from the original movie, Elwood gets stuck mentoring an orphan boy, Buster, who turns out to be a blues prodigy. Add John Goodman's equally goofy character, "Mighty" Mack McTeer, into the mix and you've got a recipe for disaster. The only things that saves this movie from being a 0/10 are the outstanding musical sequences (with the exception of Johnny Lang's "contribution"). With the exception of John Belushi, the original band is reunited in this film and they do not disappoint! The Blues Brothers Band and the various cameos from famous musicians throughout the movie are reason enough to watch it. The final sequence, a Battle of the Bands contest, is particularly good. To Summarize: the movie sucks, but the music is great! Watch it at least once, especially if you've seen the original.

    If a sequel to the iconic 1980's film The Blues Brothers needed to be made, I would've much rather seem John Goodman assume the role of Jake Blues, the chubby and talky half of the Blues brothers rather than watch an overlong, padded out tribute film to the group, involving the surviving half of the brothers, Elwood, desperately try to get the old band back together in an effort to keep the blues alive. There is an uncanny stench of desperation from the screen as the obligatory sequel plot takes fold and sadly consumes the iconic trail the original 1980's classic paved. I recall my original review of The Blues Brothers with dread upon viewing its unnecessary sequel. I stated, "there are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them," and conclude with, "The Blues Brothers is a fun, energized comedy that starts fast and rarely lets up in terms of comedy and music. It's a Chicago classic and one of the funniest and smartest musical comedies I have yet to see." The sequel takes all the fun out of its formula and replaces it with wasted energy. There's nothing here that couldn't have been simply put on a soundtrack and left at that. Dan Aykroyd reprises his role as Elwood, as he tries so hard to make new friendships, one of which involving a ten year old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), who he takes along upon learning of his rather somber roots at the orphanage Jake and Elwood were raised in and saved from being demolished in the original film. He learns that Buster has a talent for playing the harmonica and gives him a slick suit and shades to join in the revival band. Elwood also recruits Mack McTeer (played by John Goodman), a bartender from a new strip club he has just found out about, and Cab (Joe Morton), the illegitimate son of an old friend who is initially bitter and cold towards the idea of a band but soon can not refuse. One of the strongest moments is the three minute long musical rendition of Wilson Pickett's "634-5789," about a phone number, when dialed, will connect the lonely caller to attractive women who will provide them with a good time. If only they saw who was really working the phone lines. For every infectious dance sequence we get, we get an endless amount of stale comedy littered with unimpressive jokes and redundant banter. The musical numbers are the saving grace here but, again, that's what soundtracks are for. It's hard to say exactly where Blues Brothers 2000 goes wrong. It seems to have all the working components for a sequel to the original film. It is written by Aykroyd himself and John Landis (who again assumes the director role), two men who should know the material better than any soul, and we can see they desperately tried to work around the deaths of co-workers John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy in order to make a sequel work, and John Goodman seems as good as anyone to proudly boast the suit and glasses, yet the pieces do not fit like they're supposed to. This is more of a tribute film rather than a direct sequel. I'll end this on a rather loose comparison; if the original Blues Brothers film was Hall and Oates, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the Hall and Oates cover band that's biggest gig is open mic night down at the town pub. They may not be too painful, but hell, it just ain't the real thing. Starring: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, J. Evan Bonifant, Joe Morton, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King.

I am really disappointed with Dan Ackroyd, he is almost always good, and this movie looks like he was asleep at the wheel.

    So many people regard this movie as horrible because of the original. I loved the original just like everyone else, but I don't completely hate a movie just because of that. Yes, John Belushi had passed on and wasn't able to be in the movie. However, I bet that he would of wanted it to take place. Had he still been alive, I'm sure he would of been one of the first people signed on for it's production. It has a great cast with a light storyline just like the first. Amazing music just like the first. The only thing missing is Mr. Belushi himself, but that is in no way a reason this movie should be voted a 4/10. Believe me, if you liked the first one movie, give this movie a shot. Go into with a care free mind and you will enjoy it just like you did the first. You will want to dance around, just like you did the first. Enjoy!! :)

    as i watched this i assumed that when Dan Aykroyd and John Landis wrote this they didn't worry much about the plot and focused more on the music, because its great! James Brown, Aretha Franklyn and of course the Blues brothers themselves were good, even though there was no John nor Jim Belushi. tons of other performers pop up as well, such as BB King, Erykah Badu, Paul Shaffer, Eric Floyd, Wilson Picket, Blues Traveler, Sam Moore and many others, but don't really add much to the story, which has Elwood (Akroyd) released from prison bringing the band back together one last time, along with new members, to enter a Battle of the bands contest, once again chased by the cops as well as a Russian mafia. It was kinda cool to see some of the old band members have new jobs, Willie has a strip club, Steve and Donald are radio DJS, and so forth, but that doesn't forgive the weak plot, which just rehashed the first movie, and the car chases, while good at first went on a little too long. the acting was OK, Akroyd as Elwood got annoying, John Goodman as Mighty Mac was good, but no John Belushi. Joe Morton was OK as Cab, the cop who turns out to be Curtis's son, and J Evan Bonifant was OK as Buster, an orphan who follows Elwood around. Overall good music, weak plot

    I like John Landis, and I consider Blues Brothers(along with An American Werewolf in London) his best movie. This sequel is one of his weakest sadly, it has its moments, the cinematography and production values are very good, Dan Aykroyd visibly tries to bring some vigour and energy into his role and the music is absolutely top-notch. However, Landis's direction feels a little inexperienced this time around, while the story is a mess, no scratch that the story is almost non-existent and the first half is pretty much a complete re-hash. The script lacks the wit and quirks that were so evident in the original too, while the pace is uneven, mostly too rushed and the energy is severely lacking, almost as if a helium balloon was burst and any energy that went with it was lost. Aykroyd tries hard, but John Goodman(who I like) is wasted with a poor character and bad dialogue. Overall, disappointing but the music is worth a listen so it isn't a complete waste. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    This was stupid on so many levels. Why this was made, no idea. It's not nearly as good as the first Blues Brothers and has pure boredom to entertain you. Just because a boatload of musicians are in here and because Dan Aykroyd is in it, does not make it a Blue Brotehrs movie. The story is retarded, beyond stupid and the poor execution of comedy by trying to have 100 police cars fly over each other in an accident is just lousy to the extreme. It's not funny. It's lame. John Goodman - whom is always fantastic has been greatly wasted in here. This is what basically killed his career. Before this movie, he had a rocking career and after this, well it all went downhill. This movie is bottom of the barrel, not even good enough for a rainy day.

    This directionless and unnecessary sequel sees Dan Aykroyd reforming the old Blues Brothers band, this time with John Goodman, Joe Morton and where-is-he-now child actor J. Evan Bonifant. There's no story, just a series of musical set pieces and car crashes - much like the original movie, only not as good. Too much of the film is devoted to prolonged set-up, very few jokes are funny, and John Landis's direction is hopelessly static. But the music, as before, is fantastic; the concert sequences have an energy sorely lacking in the rest of the film. In the name of full disclosure, there is one terrific scene: a huge pile up in which car after car after car after smash into each other until there's a ridiculously huge pile of tangled metal in the middle of the road. Otherwise, it's missable.

    The whole movie seemed like a throwback/tribute to the original. It didn't really try at all to stand on its own merits, it just came across as an excuse for the cast (most of whom were in the original) to relive the good ole' days. Most of the scenes and plot points mirrored those of the original film. Aside from that, the signature clothing (black suit, black fedora, sunglasses, etc.) and the Bluesmobile, this movie is almost unrecognizable from the original film. Out of the two stars of the original, only Dan Aykroyd survived to make this film. (RIP John Belushi.) Unfortunately, Elwood Blues must have gone to the grave with Jake Blues, because Dan Aykroyd's reprisal of his role is disgraceful. Elwood's voice, accent, mannerisms, and overall attitude have totally changed...for the worse. A once mysterious, serious, resourceful, and charming character has been warped into a worthless goofball, and this change sets the tone for the rest of the movie as well. The original movie, though very funny, had a serious tone to it (at least the performances seemed that way), but Blues Brothers 2000 is just goofy and cheesy. The only thing that I can compare the goofiness/cheesiness to is a kids movie...which makes sense since one of the main characters of this movie IS a kid, "Buster Blues". After visiting The Penguin from the original movie, Elwood gets stuck mentoring an orphan boy, Buster, who turns out to be a blues prodigy. Add John Goodman's equally goofy character, "Mighty" Mack McTeer, into the mix and you've got a recipe for disaster. The only things that saves this movie from being a 0/10 are the outstanding musical sequences (with the exception of Johnny Lang's "contribution"). With the exception of John Belushi, the original band is reunited in this film and they do not disappoint! The Blues Brothers Band and the various cameos from famous musicians throughout the movie are reason enough to watch it. The final sequence, a Battle of the Bands contest, is particularly good. To Summarize: the movie sucks, but the music is great! Watch it at least once, especially if you've seen the original.

    If a sequel to the iconic 1980's film The Blues Brothers needed to be made, I would've much rather seem John Goodman assume the role of Jake Blues, the chubby and talky half of the Blues brothers rather than watch an overlong, padded out tribute film to the group, involving the surviving half of the brothers, Elwood, desperately try to get the old band back together in an effort to keep the blues alive. There is an uncanny stench of desperation from the screen as the obligatory sequel plot takes fold and sadly consumes the iconic trail the original 1980's classic paved. I recall my original review of The Blues Brothers with dread upon viewing its unnecessary sequel. I stated, "there are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them," and conclude with, "The Blues Brothers is a fun, energized comedy that starts fast and rarely lets up in terms of comedy and music. It's a Chicago classic and one of the funniest and smartest musical comedies I have yet to see." The sequel takes all the fun out of its formula and replaces it with wasted energy. There's nothing here that couldn't have been simply put on a soundtrack and left at that. Dan Aykroyd reprises his role as Elwood, as he tries so hard to make new friendships, one of which involving a ten year old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), who he takes along upon learning of his rather somber roots at the orphanage Jake and Elwood were raised in and saved from being demolished in the original film. He learns that Buster has a talent for playing the harmonica and gives him a slick suit and shades to join in the revival band. Elwood also recruits Mack McTeer (played by John Goodman), a bartender from a new strip club he has just found out about, and Cab (Joe Morton), the illegitimate son of an old friend who is initially bitter and cold towards the idea of a band but soon can not refuse. One of the strongest moments is the three minute long musical rendition of Wilson Pickett's "634-5789," about a phone number, when dialed, will connect the lonely caller to attractive women who will provide them with a good time. If only they saw who was really working the phone lines. For every infectious dance sequence we get, we get an endless amount of stale comedy littered with unimpressive jokes and redundant banter. The musical numbers are the saving grace here but, again, that's what soundtracks are for. It's hard to say exactly where Blues Brothers 2000 goes wrong. It seems to have all the working components for a sequel to the original film. It is written by Aykroyd himself and John Landis (who again assumes the director role), two men who should know the material better than any soul, and we can see they desperately tried to work around the deaths of co-workers John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy in order to make a sequel work, and John Goodman seems as good as anyone to proudly boast the suit and glasses, yet the pieces do not fit like they're supposed to. This is more of a tribute film rather than a direct sequel. I'll end this on a rather loose comparison; if the original Blues Brothers film was Hall and Oates, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the Hall and Oates cover band that's biggest gig is open mic night down at the town pub. They may not be too painful, but hell, it just ain't the real thing. Starring: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, J. Evan Bonifant, Joe Morton, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King. Directed by: John Landis.

    It is plain as day that this movie was simply made to ride the coat tails of the original and "hope" and "PRAY" that everyone who loved the original would rush out to see this. I did and this was one of only 2 movies I've EVER walked out of! The other movie I walked out of, The re-release of 'The Original Exorcist'. The only reason I walked out of that movie was because it scared the holy hell out of me. With that said, I guess 'The Blues Brothers 2000' did as well. I love movies. Good, bad, B movies, block busters, I give them all a chance and enjoy with an open mind. This movie was almost an insult to movie goers the world over. And the budget for the film was decent! Almost $30 mil! But turning the blues brothers into zombies? Tossing in a kid for "family appeal"? And a car that is basically like night rider? If you watch this movie at all, do yourself a favor and fast forward to the end. THE ONLY GREAT THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE.... Is the closing Battle Of The Bands. I'm not spoiling anything here. All I will say is the music is great and seeing all those amazing musicians made watching this over again, worth it. But like I said. Just fast forward to the end. For all the amazing movies big Dan has done, he definitely regrets letting his fans down with this pile of steaming Hollywood "hey they loved the original, lets make money with a remake" flop fest.

    Remember Jake and Elwood Blues and their mission from god? Of course you do. Who doesn't love those Blues Brothers and their musical mayhem induced misadventures? This movie is nothing more than an attempt to try and follow up to the original - and it fails. John Landis returns to direct even though some say that his directing career sort of went downhill in the late 80's (specifically some say it was after the accident that killed Vic Morrow and those kids during the filming of Twilight Zone: The Movie) and onto the 90's (although Oscar with Sly Stallone was moderately good - heck Siskel and Ebert both gave it a thumbs-up). Dan Akyroyd returns as writer and star of this movie as Elwood Blues, at the beginning of this movie Elwood is just getting out of prison when he receives news from the Penguin (no, not the Batman villain, the nun from the first movie) that his partner Jake Blues has unfortunately passed away. This is never explained in the movie at all even though in the opening credits it says it is dedicated to the memory of John Belushi as well as to John Candy and Cab Calloway, who also passed away before this movie got made. So Elwood tries to get the rest of the old band together, minus Jake of course. Along the way we meet the new guys: First of which is Mighty Mack played by John Goodman. (Come on Goodman, you're far too good to be in a movie like this). We also meet our Tagalong Kid character who goes by the name Buster. We also meet Cabby who is reluctant to join until he receives a message from above and is instantly transformed into a Blues Brothers band member. The light shines down on him and he seems to be floating for some reason. I'd hate to steal a joke from Film Brain, but.....SYMBOLISM! Next we have some of the zaniest and messed up car chase scenes ever- the chase scenes in the original were truly spectacular but here they're just completely cartoonish. Such as the Bluesmobile being able to go underwater. We get it, the Bluesmobile is an awesome car - it can survive anything. This is completely and utterly insane even by this logic. What? Is it it like Linkara's magic gun or something? Is it possessed ala Christine? After all that nonsense we get to see a few returning cameos mainly by James Brown (r.i.p godfather of soul) and Aretha Franklin. And I admit the musical numbers in this are pretty awesome. There's also a scene where the band go to see a voodoo queen/priestess by the name of Queen Mousette (this scene is later referenced/paid homage to in the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie). So the voodoo priestess asks the band if they know any calapyso songs to which Elwood tells her that the band can play all kinds of musical but to the calalypso part he says no (this is the second time Dan Akyroyd has actually said no when answering a powerful being such as a ghost, deity or sorceress - the first one being in Ghostbusters). Because of this she transforms them into green skinned zombies that sing calapyso songs and I admit, their performance of Funky Nassau is pretty good. But this is just flat out of nowhere. It's like I'm expecting MJ to make an appearance and start dancing along with them (hey...it would be Thriller: The Sequel). And this just comes out of nowhere. So...yeah...it's...a Big Lipped Aligator Moment! Also a few of the band members get turned into stone. Don't tell me Queen Mousette is actually part Gorgon! There are also several scenes in which several more of the ever-growing enemy list for the bad show up including some russians who get turned into mice. There are more wacky car chase scenes, some more musical numbers and Elwood gives a speech which is extremely epic as well as some goofy slapstick including the band getting covered in goo (most likely the same stuff the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man was made out of). And after all this - the band finally get to perform as the movie ends, during the end credits we see a performance by James Brown along with the band. So that was Blues Brothers 2000, and was it any good? Not really. It's pretty iffy overall - the musical numbers are fun and there are some good scenes but most of it is completely weird. Also why doesn't it ever explain the cause of Jake's death? I'm serious. We don't ever get an explanation for this at all. Dan Akyroyd does well but I think even he knows how bad this movie was going to be, as for the other performers - well they did rather well but again....you can't top the original. The movie is okay....but it will never be as good as the original. Maybe i'm looking at this through Nostalgia goggles but i personally believe and know that the original is and always will be the best. Blues Brothers 20000 doesn't hold up well and compared to the original just flat out fails. I give it 2 out of 10 stars and only 1% out of 1000, the music was the only strong point - the rest was just plain weird. I don't recommend seeing this one, instead...just stick to the original movie and you'll be fine.

    If this movie was not a sequel of one of the best cult movies of the past 30+ years, it would just a dumb movie, the fact it is is just an insult to the memory of the original cast members who passed away. I originally saw the movie when it was released on VHS, and rented the movie for $3, in the late 90's, and I felt ripped off beyond belief. I just recently rewatched the movie, and I feel just stupid for doing so. The movie is even worse the second time around. There are no redeeming qualities, or performances, to save the movie, which has a dumbass plot, and is just boring to watch. The whole 'feud' with the russians is like what a 2 year old would do, and shows early on what a disaster the movie is. The ending is pointless, driving off into the horizon with the cops chasing. Seems like no one knew how to end the movie so they went the brainless way out, at least the first movie showed what happens when you fool with the cops, you become the prison band, which made the end of the original excellent. The only thing they could have worked is have James take over John's role, because the explanation of Jake's death is soooo stupid it's insulting. In the trivia to this movie, it says the movie was ranked 4th, out of 25, worst sequels, I would like to know what was worse than this? I would have said it IS the worst. Even giving this movie a "1" seems like a compliment, but they should add a vote of "Avoid at all costs", because this is the case for this flop. I am really disappointed with Dan Ackroyd, he is almost always good, and this movie looks like he was asleep at the wheel.
