 <sinopse>
  The Devil arranges for a deceased gangster to return to Earth as a well-respected judge to make up for his previous life.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Gangster Eddie Kagel is killed by a trusted lieutenant and finds himself in Harry Redmond Jr's special-effects Hell, where Nick/The Devil sees that he is an-exact double for a judge who Nick doesn't approve of. Eddie is agreeable to having his soul transferred to the judge's body, as it will give him a chance to avenge himself on his killer. But every action taken by Eddie (as the judge) results in good rather than evil and, to Nick's dismay, the reputation and influence of the judge is enhanced, rather than impaired by Eddie. And Eddie also falls in love with the judge's fianc&eacute;e, Barbara. Even Eddie's planned revenge fails and Nick is forced to concede defeat. He returns to Hell, taking Eddie with him, after Eddie has extracted his promise that Nick will not molest the judge or Barbara in the future.

    Archie Mayo's curio "Angel on my Shoulder" is virtually unknown despite a cast headed by Paul Muni, Claude Rains and Anne Baxter. It's a fantasy along the same lines as "Here Comes Mr Jordan" and "It's a Wonderful Life". It came out in the same year as "It's a Wonderful Life" which may be one reason it's gotten lost in that movie's grander shadow or perhaps it's simply because it's not really that good. Muni seems totally lost in the role of a dead gangster fuelling the fires of Hell before he's brought back to inhabit the body of a 'good' judge the Devil is trying to get his hands on, (watching this you would never think Muni was once considered a great actor). Rains, on the other hand, looks like he's enjoying this nonsense though it's hardly what you would call acting; more like smirking as he goes through the motions. The ridiculous plot has Muni and Rains returning from Hell so that Rains' Devil can get the righteous judge down below, (and give Muni's gangster the chance to get revenge on the guy who plugged him). Of course, considering he's the Devil, Rains seems singularly unprepared for Anne Baxter's sweetness-and-light fianc&eacute;e whose goodness messes up his plans somewhat. Naturally, it's a comedy and it's not unamusing in a daft kind of way but it's hardly memorable. Par for the Archie Mayo course, in fact.

    When I was a kid I had a friend whose sister, roughly a generation our senior, was an avid collector of film magazines and annuals. This was in the UK so I'm referring to essentially 'fan' magazines such as Picture Show, Picturegoer, F. Maurice Speed's Film Review, etc. I beguiled many a rainy hour leafing through this ephemera and a 'still', from a film I'd never heard of, Angel On My Shoulder, stayed in my mind. Is showed Claude Rains and Paul Muni emerging from the ground with some bizarre metal arc over their heads. That was the last I heard of Angel On My Shoulder from that day to this, when it was screened on BBC2 at six-fifteen a.m. This I had to see, still knowing nothing about it, and so I got up early. I shudda stood in bed, as they say in New York. In the few films in which I've seen him I've always found Paul Muni so mannered as to make Emil Jannings look laid-back and this was no exception. In the early scenes especially he looked for all the world like someone in a Silent film being directed to express 'terror' or 'zombie', it was hard to decide. As for hell itself it resembled nothing so much as a German 'Expressionist' version of Gene O'Neill's The Hairy Ape. Claude Rains was his usual suave self but forget any chemistry between him and Muni and forget even more strongly any chemistry between Muni and his 'love interest' Anne Baxter. A couple of days before I'd seen Baxter attempting to scare up some chemistry with Monty Clift in I Confess, so it seemed she was, for a time, lumbered with leading men off whom she was unable to strike sparks. It was definitely worth seeing, especially after waiting a lifetime on the strength of one 'still', but once is definitely enough.

    Paul Mini is Eddie Kagel, a tough gangster who is just released from prison after a four-year stretch. He's picked up at the gate by his old friend Smiley, who greets him effusively, considering that he's another hood. The pair drive away, punching each other lovingly on the arms, friends since childhood. "Where's my rod?" asks Muni. "I got it right here," replies the smiling Smiley. "Give it to me," says Muni. Smiley pulls out the gun and shoots Muni dead. Muni finds himself in hell, which turns out to look a lot like Newark, New Jersey, all flames, furnaces, bubbling mud pots, and "hotter than Florida." The Devil is Claude Raines, who looks pretty Satanic with those kick lights always under his face. The suave Raines makes a deal. He'll take Muni back and plant him in the body of an honest judge. Muni will do his evil act and ruin the good judge's reputation. Then Raines will let Muni give Smiley what's coming to him. Well -- the best laid plans, you know? Enter the judge's sexy, good-looking girl friend, Anne Baxter. She's so disgustingly virtuous that she's at first shocked by the new judge's lack of social polish. He says things like, "Say, ain't no dame ever put nothing over on me." His manners are pustular. He gulps down double scotches and smokes cigars. And he doesn't know what the hell is going on. He talks to the now-invisible Raines, who is coaxing him on how to be bad, as if Muni needed lessons. I think the sophisticated viewer can take the plot from here. Baxter converts Muni into a man of the most pure moral thoughts. Muni now loves Baxter but he no longer gropes her at every opportunity. He refuses to kill the treacherous Smiley when he has the chance. The disgusted Raines gives up, returns the original judge, and takes Muni back to hell, where he will be a trustee instead of a stoker. I was a little mixed up about the whereabouts of the original judge, the one Muni, as Kagel, replaced. No matter. This is a fantasy, and an old one at that. Except for the personae and some plot details, you must have seen it before in one or another of its incarnations -- "Here Comes Mister Jordan," or "Heaven Can Wait," "A Guy Named Joe," "Always." Two of those are remakes of the other two. It's a pleasant enough diversion, although I wish the writers hadn't confused hydrogen sulfide with H2SO4. They could also have gotten the quote from Dante accurate. It's not "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here." It's "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here." Heck, I had to look that up in Wikipedia. It only took a few minutes, and I don't see why the writers couldn't have taken the time. Muni is often accused of overacting and I guess he does overact, but I didn't mind much. His simian features were a little disturbing. It's difficult to understand how the cute, chubby, petite Anne Baxter could have fallen for a guy who looks like that -- but then he's a big-shot mayor and is headed for the governorship. Okay. I think I do understand.

    Paul Muni shines in this 1946 film. What else is new? He beautifully conveys the title role of a mug shot to death by a gang friend wanting to take the organization over. While in Hades, he meets up with Claude Rains as Lucifer. He goes back to extract revenge by exchanging roles with a look-alike judge. This excellent film conveys the possibility of redemption even on the part of such a hardened criminal. Amazing that Anne Baxter, as the judge's girlfriend, has a part that is relatively so benign here. This is the same Baxter who marched down that Oscar aisle that same year for her splendid performance as the ill-fated Sophie in "The Razor's Edge." The film is a great one and should not be missed.

    Paul Muni is a hard-boiled gangster who literally goes to Hell. Claude Raines is a smooth Devil who will cut Muni a deal if he goes back to Earth and ruins the name of a good and upright man. Ann Baxter is the monkey wrench. Sounds like a drama and it is, but it's kind of a "comedy-noir". It's also a great romantic comedy. Paul Muni is tough, funny and at times sensitive, Anne Baxter is a long suffering fianc&eacute; and just the kind of woman for whom a tough mug like Muni's Eddie could turn over a new leaf, and Claude Raines makes an excellent "Nick", both funny and ominous. There is a nice twist at the end and the closing scene is one of my favorite finales in filmdom.

    Paul Muni is intense and dumb as the gangster Eddie Kagle. Claude Rains is gleeful and wicked as the Devil. They're the main reasons to watch this classic and enjoyable film. This was Archie Mayo's last film. He had directed some very good ones in the 1920's through the 1940's, including "the Petrified Forest." It is not a bad film to end a career on. Basically, this is a medieval morality tale brought up to date by putting it squarely in the Gangster Film genre of the golden age of Hollywood. For the most part evil/sin/hell is equated with gangster/violence/ignorance. The post theological, scientific view that crime is a function of social and economic conditions in a society is abandoned for the more primitive religious view that evil souls are placed in material bodies at birth. Salvation comes through love, sacrifice and the good fortune of hearing religious anti-devil preaching. While communist/socialist writers and actors did influence many movies of the period, we should remember that the rigid Catholic Morality Hays code was king at this time, and quasi religious films involving angels and devils were quite common. In one way these films are so absurd they subvert the conceptual paradigm of angels and devils. On the other hand, they lend support to and reinforce this type of primitive thinking. Anne Baxter (All About Eve) is delightful in the small role of Muni's fianc&eacute;. The sets, cinematography and sound are all top notch for the period. This is a good companion film to "Here Comes Mr. Jordan."

    Angel on My Shoulder (1946) It's great to see Paul Muni in another role--he's a great actor who did too few films--and it's never bad to see Claude Rains. In this case Muni plays a con who has gone to hell, and Rains is the devil himself. They have an arrangement to go up to the surface of the earth and some trickiness ensues. It's fun, deceptive, sometimes humorous, sometimes romantically serious. Because the plot is a clear contrivance, the movie does have a slightly illustrative sense, the way "Harvey" does with James Stewart. But sometimes you forget about the devil and the deals he's made, and you just watch, and the best parts of the movie rise above the cleverness. This is director Archie Mayo's last film, and though he no Hollywood legend, he was a serious, consistent director, and this proves it.

    Eddie Kagle (Paul Muni) is shot dead by Smiley (Hardie Albright) but is given a second chance at life by Nick (Claude Rains). Nick is Satan and is concerned that he's not getting enough followers these days. Eddie's task is to take over the body of Judge Parker and start misbehaving and corrupting a few people. In return, Nick promises that Eddie can avenge his death by killing Smiley. With the deal struck, Nick and Eddie set about their business. However, circumstances don't go as planned and Nick hadn't counted on the influence that Judge Parker's fianc&eacute;e, Barbara (Anne Baxter) exerts over Eddie...... This film is a comedy that is very funny due to Eddie's out-of-character behaviour as Judge Parker. The 3 main characters are all very good in their parts. Claude Rains is a stylish devil while Anne Baxter is a strong-minded woman who holds her own in the face of her husband's character transformation. We are carried along with the story of incidents that go wrong and witness the growing bond that develops between the characters of Barbara and Eddie Kagle, posing as the Judge. Alongside the humour, we have emotional moments as we realize that Eddie and Barbara's love is a love that can never be. It's sad and it made me cry. Paul Muni and Anne Baxter express their separate heartbreaks very convincingly, while Claude Rains is always amusing in his role. It's a fun story. What a shame that the quality of the picture isn't very good. Oh, and by the way, hell isn't actually like that at all.....

    Let out of jail, gangster Paul Mini (as Eddie Kagle) is shot dead by the "double crossing rat" who picks him up at the prison. Uncomfortable in Hell, Mr. Muni hooks up with wicked Claude Rains (as "Nick"), who seems to know his way around the underworld. Not guessing Mr. Rains is the devil in disguise, Muni walks with Rains through fire, and returns to observe the Living World. There, Rains arranges a body-switch with look-alike Judge Frederick Parker (also played by Muni). Muni is promised revenge on the crook who crossed him; and, Rains is unhappy with the Judge, who hasn't been sending many souls to Hell. So, criminal Muni embodies good Muni... Archie Mayo's "Angel on My Shoulder" isn't as well-remembered, or as original, as other films visiting the same territory; but, watching Muni and Rains makes up most of the difference. This version is played as a sometimes comic drama, and the stars are devilishly fun to watch. Also notable is Anne Baxter (as Barbara Foster), who plays the pretty fianc&eacute;e Muni amusingly gropes with approval, then falls in love with. She may be his salvation. Perfectly cast Hardie Albright (as Smiley Williams) is no slouch; in once of the film's best scenes, he holds his own with Muni and Rains in the room. Others haven't as much to do, but they do it well. ******* Angel on My Shoulder (9/20/46) Archie Mayo ~ Paul Muni, Claude Rains, Anne Baxter, Hardie Albright

    This was an effort to rekindle the success of Here Comes Mr Jordan in which Claude Rains played a heavenly emissary righting some wrongs. Here Paul Muni plays a thug who gets out of the joint, is instantly killed but returned to life in the body of a judge, and can't let go of his sense of vengeance. This time Rains plays the devil himself. He's quite good and more menacing than a movie of the era would typically allow. The noir stylings are nice. These may be the blackest compositions I've ever seen in a movie. The early minutes in hell look terrific and the movie gets a lot of mileage from a few flames and some grimy, underlit faces. Rain's supernatural character also receives special lighting against dark backgrounds throughout. But it's rather odd that a fantasy goes with a "frustrated romance" format, when comedy seems to be just beneath the surface. And the script is bad; the narrative gets convoluted and the movie lacks any really great scenes. After hell the movie is very blah. A promising, atypical concept is just converted into dozens of unmemorable, conventionalized scenes. All the Kings Men, State of the Union and His Girl Friday all make finer, funnier and smarter moments from political intrigue. And the simple fact is; it's not enjoyable to spend 90 minutes with a lead character this ignorant and vulgar. Muni's redemption arc is very schlocky, and his performance is something out of the distant past. At 50, he's looking a bit gruesome for a leading man role.

In this case Muni plays a con who has gone to hell, and Rains is the devil himself. They have an arrangement to go up to the surface of the earth and some trickiness ensues. It's fun, deceptive, sometimes humorous, sometimes romantically serious. Because the plot is a clear contrivance, the movie does have a slightly illustrative sense, the way "Harvey" does with James Stewart. But sometimes you forget about the devil and the deals he's made, and you just watch, and the best parts of the movie rise above the cleverness. This is director Archie Mayo's last film, and though he no Hollywood legend, he was a serious, consistent director, and this proves it.

    Eddie Kagle (Paul Muni) is shot dead by Smiley (Hardie Albright) but is given a second chance at life by Nick (Claude Rains). Nick is Satan and is concerned that he's not getting enough followers these days. Eddie's task is to take over the body of Judge Parker and start misbehaving and corrupting a few people. In return, Nick promises that Eddie can avenge his death by killing Smiley. With the deal struck, Nick and Eddie set about their business. However, circumstances don't go as planned and Nick hadn't counted on the influence that Judge Parker's fianc&eacute;e, Barbara (Anne Baxter) exerts over Eddie...... This film is a comedy that is very funny due to Eddie's out-of-character behaviour as Judge Parker. The 3 main characters are all very good in their parts. Claude Rains is a stylish devil while Anne Baxter is a strong-minded woman who holds her own in the face of her husband's character transformation. We are carried along with the story of incidents that go wrong and witness the growing bond that develops between the characters of Barbara and Eddie Kagle, posing as the Judge. Alongside the humour, we have emotional moments as we realize that Eddie and Barbara's love is a love that can never be. It's sad and it made me cry. Paul Muni and Anne Baxter express their separate heartbreaks very convincingly, while Claude Rains is always amusing in his role. It's a fun story. What a shame that the quality of the picture isn't very good. Oh, and by the way, hell isn't actually like that at all.....

    Let out of jail, gangster Paul Mini (as Eddie Kagle) is shot dead by the "double crossing rat" who picks him up at the prison. Uncomfortable in Hell, Mr. Muni hooks up with wicked Claude Rains (as "Nick"), who seems to know his way around the underworld. Not guessing Mr. Rains is the devil in disguise, Muni walks with Rains through fire, and returns to observe the Living World. There, Rains arranges a body-switch with look-alike Judge Frederick Parker (also played by Muni). Muni is promised revenge on the crook who crossed him; and, Rains is unhappy with the Judge, who hasn't been sending many souls to Hell. So, criminal Muni embodies good Muni... Archie Mayo's "Angel on My Shoulder" isn't as well-remembered, or as original, as other films visiting the same territory; but, watching Muni and Rains makes up most of the difference. This version is played as a sometimes comic drama, and the stars are devilishly fun to watch. Also notable is Anne Baxter (as Barbara Foster), who plays the pretty fianc&eacute;e Muni amusingly gropes with approval, then falls in love with. She may be his salvation. Perfectly cast Hardie Albright (as Smiley Williams) is no slouch; in once of the film's best scenes, he holds his own with Muni and Rains in the room. Others haven't as much to do, but they do it well. ******* Angel on My Shoulder (9/20/46) Archie Mayo ~ Paul Muni, Claude Rains, Anne Baxter, Hardie Albright

    This was an effort to rekindle the success of Here Comes Mr Jordan in which Claude Rains played a heavenly emissary righting some wrongs. Here Paul Muni plays a thug who gets out of the joint, is instantly killed but returned to life in the body of a judge, and can't let go of his sense of vengeance. This time Rains plays the devil himself. He's quite good and more menacing than a movie of the era would typically allow. The noir stylings are nice. These may be the blackest compositions I've ever seen in a movie. The early minutes in hell look terrific and the movie gets a lot of mileage from a few flames and some grimy, underlit faces. Rain's supernatural character also receives special lighting against dark backgrounds throughout. But it's rather odd that a fantasy goes with a "frustrated romance" format, when comedy seems to be just beneath the surface. And the script is bad; the narrative gets convoluted and the movie lacks any really great scenes. After hell the movie is very blah. A promising, atypical concept is just converted into dozens of unmemorable, conventionalized scenes. All the Kings Men, State of the Union and His Girl Friday all make finer, funnier and smarter moments from political intrigue. And the simple fact is; it's not enjoyable to spend 90 minutes with a lead character this ignorant and vulgar. Muni's redemption arc is very schlocky, and his performance is something out of the distant past. At 50, he's looking a bit gruesome for a leading man role.

    Archie Mayo's curio "Angel on my Shoulder" is virtually unknown despite a cast headed by Paul Muni, Claude Rains and Anne Baxter. It's a fantasy along the same lines as "Here Comes Mr Jordan" and "It's a Wonderful Life". It came out in the same year as "It's a Wonderful Life" which may be one reason it's gotten lost in that movie's grander shadow or perhaps it's simply because it's not really that good. Muni seems totally lost in the role of a dead gangster fuelling the fires of Hell before he's brought back to inhabit the body of a 'good' judge the Devil is trying to get his hands on, (watching this you would never think Muni was once considered a great actor). Rains, on the other hand, looks like he's enjoying this nonsense though it's hardly what you would call acting; more like smirking as he goes through the motions. The ridiculous plot has Muni and Rains returning from Hell so that Rains' Devil can get the righteous judge down below, (and give Muni's gangster the chance to get revenge on the guy who plugged him). Of course, considering he's the Devil, Rains seems singularly unprepared for Anne Baxter's sweetness-and-light fianc&eacute;e whose goodness messes up his plans somewhat. Naturally, it's a comedy and it's not unamusing in a daft kind of way but it's hardly memorable. Par for the Archie Mayo course, in fact.

    When I was a kid I had a friend whose sister, roughly a generation our senior, was an avid collector of film magazines and annuals. This was in the UK so I'm referring to essentially 'fan' magazines such as Picture Show, Picturegoer, F. Maurice Speed's Film Review, etc. I beguiled many a rainy hour leafing through this ephemera and a 'still', from a film I'd never heard of, Angel On My Shoulder, stayed in my mind. Is showed Claude Rains and Paul Muni emerging from the ground with some bizarre metal arc over their heads. That was the last I heard of Angel On My Shoulder from that day to this, when it was screened on BBC2 at six-fifteen a.m. This I had to see, still knowing nothing about it, and so I got up early. I shudda stood in bed, as they say in New York. In the few films in which I've seen him I've always found Paul Muni so mannered as to make Emil Jannings look laid-back and this was no exception. In the early scenes especially he looked for all the world like someone in a Silent film being directed to express 'terror' or 'zombie', it was hard to decide. As for hell itself it resembled nothing so much as a German 'Expressionist' version of Gene O'Neill's The Hairy Ape. Claude Rains was his usual suave self but forget any chemistry between him and Muni and forget even more strongly any chemistry between Muni and his 'love interest' Anne Baxter. A couple of days before I'd seen Baxter attempting to scare up some chemistry with Monty Clift in I Confess, so it seemed she was, for a time, lumbered with leading men off whom she was unable to strike sparks. It was definitely worth seeing, especially after waiting a lifetime on the strength of one 'still', but once is definitely enough.

    Paul Mini is Eddie Kagel, a tough gangster who is just released from prison after a four-year stretch. He's picked up at the gate by his old friend Smiley, who greets him effusively, considering that he's another hood. The pair drive away, punching each other lovingly on the arms, friends since childhood. "Where's my rod?" asks Muni. "I got it right here," replies the smiling Smiley. "Give it to me," says Muni. Smiley pulls out the gun and shoots Muni dead. Muni finds himself in hell, which turns out to look a lot like Newark, New Jersey, all flames, furnaces, bubbling mud pots, and "hotter than Florida." The Devil is Claude Raines, who looks pretty Satanic with those kick lights always under his face. The suave Raines makes a deal. He'll take Muni back and plant him in the body of an honest judge. Muni will do his evil act and ruin the good judge's reputation. Then Raines will let Muni give Smiley what's coming to him. Well -- the best laid plans, you know? Enter the judge's sexy, good-looking girl friend, Anne Baxter. She's so disgustingly virtuous that she's at first shocked by the new judge's lack of social polish. He says things like, "Say, ain't no dame ever put nothing over on me." His manners are pustular. He gulps down double scotches and smokes cigars. And he doesn't know what the hell is going on. He talks to the now-invisible Raines, who is coaxing him on how to be bad, as if Muni needed lessons. I think the sophisticated viewer can take the plot from here. Baxter converts Muni into a man of the most pure moral thoughts. Muni now loves Baxter but he no longer gropes her at every opportunity. He refuses to kill the treacherous Smiley when he has the chance. The disgusted Raines gives up, returns the original judge, and takes Muni back to hell, where he will be a trustee instead of a stoker. I was a little mixed up about the whereabouts of the original judge, the one Muni, as Kagel, replaced. No matter. This is a fantasy, and an old one at that. Except for the personae and some plot details, you must have seen it before in one or another of its incarnations -- "Here Comes Mister Jordan," or "Heaven Can Wait," "A Guy Named Joe," "Always." Two of those are remakes of the other two. It's a pleasant enough diversion, although I wish the writers hadn't confused hydrogen sulfide with H2SO4. They could also have gotten the quote from Dante accurate. It's not "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here." It's "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here." Heck, I had to look that up in Wikipedia. It only took a few minutes, and I don't see why the writers couldn't have taken the time. Muni is often accused of overacting and I guess he does overact, but I didn't mind much. His simian features were a little disturbing. It's difficult to understand how the cute, chubby, petite Anne Baxter could have fallen for a guy who looks like that -- but then he's a big-shot mayor and is headed for the governorship. Okay. I think I do understand.

    Paul Muni shines in this 1946 film. What else is new? He beautifully conveys the title role of a mug shot to death by a gang friend wanting to take the organization over. While in Hades, he meets up with Claude Rains as Lucifer. He goes back to extract revenge by exchanging roles with a look-alike judge. This excellent film conveys the possibility of redemption even on the part of such a hardened criminal. Amazing that Anne Baxter, as the judge's girlfriend, has a part that is relatively so benign here. This is the same Baxter who marched down that Oscar aisle that same year for her splendid performance as the ill-fated Sophie in "The Razor's Edge." The film is a great one and should not be missed.

    Paul Muni is a hard-boiled gangster who literally goes to Hell. Claude Raines is a smooth Devil who will cut Muni a deal if he goes back to Earth and ruins the name of a good and upright man. Ann Baxter is the monkey wrench. Sounds like a drama and it is, but it's kind of a "comedy-noir". It's also a great romantic comedy. Paul Muni is tough, funny and at times sensitive, Anne Baxter is a long suffering fianc&eacute; and just the kind of woman for whom a tough mug like Muni's Eddie could turn over a new leaf, and Claude Raines makes an excellent "Nick", both funny and ominous. There is a nice twist at the end and the closing scene is one of my favorite finales in filmdom.

    Paul Muni is intense and dumb as the gangster Eddie Kagle. Claude Rains is gleeful and wicked as the Devil. They're the main reasons to watch this classic and enjoyable film. This was Archie Mayo's last film. He had directed some very good ones in the 1920's through the 1940's, including "the Petrified Forest." It is not a bad film to end a career on. Basically, this is a medieval morality tale brought up to date by putting it squarely in the Gangster Film genre of the golden age of Hollywood. For the most part evil/sin/hell is equated with gangster/violence/ignorance. The post theological, scientific view that crime is a function of social and economic conditions in a society is abandoned for the more primitive religious view that evil souls are placed in material bodies at birth. Salvation comes through love, sacrifice and the good fortune of hearing religious anti-devil preaching. While communist/socialist writers and actors did influence many movies of the period, we should remember that the rigid Catholic Morality Hays code was king at this time, and quasi religious films involving angels and devils were quite common. In one way these films are so absurd they subvert the conceptual paradigm of angels and devils. On the other hand, they lend support to and reinforce this type of primitive thinking. Anne Baxter (All About Eve) is delightful in the small role of Muni's fianc&eacute;. The sets, cinematography and sound are all top notch for the period. This is a good companion film to "Here Comes Mr. Jordan."

This is the same Baxter who marched down that Oscar aisle that same year for her splendid performance as the ill-fated Sophie in "The Razor's Edge." The film is a great one and should not be missed.

    Paul Muni is a hard-boiled gangster who literally goes to Hell. Claude Raines is a smooth Devil who will cut Muni a deal if he goes back to Earth and ruins the name of a good and upright man. Ann Baxter is the monkey wrench. Sounds like a drama and it is, but it's kind of a "comedy-noir". It's also a great romantic comedy. Paul Muni is tough, funny and at times sensitive, Anne Baxter is a long suffering fianc&eacute; and just the kind of woman for whom a tough mug like Muni's Eddie could turn over a new leaf, and Claude Raines makes an excellent "Nick", both funny and ominous. There is a nice twist at the end and the closing scene is one of my favorite finales in filmdom.

    Paul Muni is intense and dumb as the gangster Eddie Kagle. Claude Rains is gleeful and wicked as the Devil. They're the main reasons to watch this classic and enjoyable film. This was Archie Mayo's last film. He had directed some very good ones in the 1920's through the 1940's, including "the Petrified Forest." It is not a bad film to end a career on. Basically, this is a medieval morality tale brought up to date by putting it squarely in the Gangster Film genre of the golden age of Hollywood. For the most part evil/sin/hell is equated with gangster/violence/ignorance. The post theological, scientific view that crime is a function of social and economic conditions in a society is abandoned for the more primitive religious view that evil souls are placed in material bodies at birth. Salvation comes through love, sacrifice and the good fortune of hearing religious anti-devil preaching. While communist/socialist writers and actors did influence many movies of the period, we should remember that the rigid Catholic Morality Hays code was king at this time, and quasi religious films involving angels and devils were quite common. In one way these films are so absurd they subvert the conceptual paradigm of angels and devils. On the other hand, they lend support to and reinforce this type of primitive thinking. Anne Baxter (All About Eve) is delightful in the small role of Muni's fianc&eacute;. The sets, cinematography and sound are all top notch for the period. This is a good companion film to "Here Comes Mr. Jordan."

    Angel on My Shoulder (1946) It's great to see Paul Muni in another role--he's a great actor who did too few films--and it's never bad to see Claude Rains. In this case Muni plays a con who has gone to hell, and Rains is the devil himself. They have an arrangement to go up to the surface of the earth and some trickiness ensues. It's fun, deceptive, sometimes humorous, sometimes romantically serious. Because the plot is a clear contrivance, the movie does have a slightly illustrative sense, the way "Harvey" does with James Stewart. But sometimes you forget about the devil and the deals he's made, and you just watch, and the best parts of the movie rise above the cleverness. This is director Archie Mayo's last film, and though he no Hollywood legend, he was a serious, consistent director, and this proves it.

    Eddie Kagle (Paul Muni) is shot dead by Smiley (Hardie Albright) but is given a second chance at life by Nick (Claude Rains). Nick is Satan and is concerned that he's not getting enough followers these days. Eddie's task is to take over the body of Judge Parker and start misbehaving and corrupting a few people. In return, Nick promises that Eddie can avenge his death by killing Smiley. With the deal struck, Nick and Eddie set about their business. However, circumstances don't go as planned and Nick hadn't counted on the influence that Judge Parker's fianc&eacute;e, Barbara (Anne Baxter) exerts over Eddie...... This film is a comedy that is very funny due to Eddie's out-of-character behaviour as Judge Parker. The 3 main characters are all very good in their parts. Claude Rains is a stylish devil while Anne Baxter is a strong-minded woman who holds her own in the face of her husband's character transformation. We are carried along with the story of incidents that go wrong and witness the growing bond that develops between the characters of Barbara and Eddie Kagle, posing as the Judge. Alongside the humour, we have emotional moments as we realize that Eddie and Barbara's love is a love that can never be. It's sad and it made me cry. Paul Muni and Anne Baxter express their separate heartbreaks very convincingly, while Claude Rains is always amusing in his role. It's a fun story. What a shame that the quality of the picture isn't very good. Oh, and by the way, hell isn't actually like that at all.....

    Let out of jail, gangster Paul Mini (as Eddie Kagle) is shot dead by the "double crossing rat" who picks him up at the prison. Uncomfortable in Hell, Mr. Muni hooks up with wicked Claude Rains (as "Nick"), who seems to know his way around the underworld. Not guessing Mr. Rains is the devil in disguise, Muni walks with Rains through fire, and returns to observe the Living World. There, Rains arranges a body-switch with look-alike Judge Frederick Parker (also played by Muni). Muni is promised revenge on the crook who crossed him; and, Rains is unhappy with the Judge, who hasn't been sending many souls to Hell. So, criminal Muni embodies good Muni... Archie Mayo's "Angel on My Shoulder" isn't as well-remembered, or as original, as other films visiting the same territory; but, watching Muni and Rains makes up most of the difference. This version is played as a sometimes comic drama, and the stars are devilishly fun to watch. Also notable is Anne Baxter (as Barbara Foster), who plays the pretty fianc&eacute;e Muni amusingly gropes with approval, then falls in love with. She may be his salvation. Perfectly cast Hardie Albright (as Smiley Williams) is no slouch; in once of the film's best scenes, he holds his own with Muni and Rains in the room. Others haven't as much to do, but they do it well. ******* Angel on My Shoulder (9/20/46) Archie Mayo ~ Paul Muni, Claude Rains, Anne Baxter, Hardie Albright

    This was an effort to rekindle the success of Here Comes Mr Jordan in which Claude Rains played a heavenly emissary righting some wrongs. Here Paul Muni plays a thug who gets out of the joint, is instantly killed but returned to life in the body of a judge, and can't let go of his sense of vengeance. This time Rains plays the devil himself. He's quite good and more menacing than a movie of the era would typically allow. The noir stylings are nice. These may be the blackest compositions I've ever seen in a movie. The early minutes in hell look terrific and the movie gets a lot of mileage from a few flames and some grimy, underlit faces. Rain's supernatural character also receives special lighting against dark backgrounds throughout. But it's rather odd that a fantasy goes with a "frustrated romance" format, when comedy seems to be just beneath the surface. And the script is bad; the narrative gets convoluted and the movie lacks any really great scenes. After hell the movie is very blah. A promising, atypical concept is just converted into dozens of unmemorable, conventionalized scenes. All the Kings Men, State of the Union and His Girl Friday all make finer, funnier and smarter moments from political intrigue. And the simple fact is; it's not enjoyable to spend 90 minutes with a lead character this ignorant and vulgar. Muni's redemption arc is very schlocky, and his performance is something out of the distant past. At 50, he's looking a bit gruesome for a leading man role.
