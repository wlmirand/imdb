    In John Cassavettes' "Faces," Richard Forst (John Marley), a successful L.A. businessman, asks his wife, Maria (Lynn Carlin), for a divorce. Forst leaves his house and goes to see his mistress, Jeannie Rapp (Gena Rowlands), a prostitute who is still entertaining a couple of business clients (Val Avery; Gene Darfler) when he gets there. Meanwhile, Maria goes out with some friends to a nightclub (appropriately called "The Losers") that is filled with loud rock music. They meet Chet (Seymour Cassel), a young macho stud from Detroit, and bring him back home to Maria's house. After her friends go home sobbing over their lost youth, Maria goes to bed with Chet. The next morning, Maria attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Watching "Faces" is like being locked in a room for two hours with a bunch of loud, obnoxious, drunken people that you don't really like. The characters alternate between telling stupid, childish jokes and laughing hysterically, then dancing around the room while singing annoying song lyrics over and over again (i.e. "I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair"), then arguing with each other, being caustic and cruel to the point of physical violence. Yes, I'm sure there are real people like this, but fortunately, I personally don't know any people who are like these characters. (At least, I *hope* I don't.) Much has been made of the movie's "realistic" style, with its hand-held camera and 16 mm black & white look. This style has influenced everyone from Woody Allen to Robert Altman to today's independent filmmakers. But the fact that the style is good doesn't mean the *movie* is good. I know that some people (particularly film critics) enjoy this type of movie. Some people enjoy flagellation, but that doesn't mean you want to participate in it. This is one of those movies that you watch once, and then  if you're lucky  you forget about it. One line from the movie did make me laugh out loud: Maria: There's a Bergman film in the neighborhood. Richard: I don't feel like getting depressed tonight. Really! You could've fooled me!

    All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players. - Shakespeare. To really understand the above statement you have to actually see the instances when the players refuse to play their parts, even if momentarily. Renoir did it in "La R&egrave;gle du jeu". People playing different roles - master and servant, husband and lover, poacher and grounds-keeper, break for their roles and connect with each other. It is one of the most beautiful movies ever made and has been in AFI Top 10 since it was released. Faces is the anti-thesis of "La R&egrave;gle du jeu". Here to the player stop playing their parts but instead of connecting with each other, they distance themselves from each other. So we have husband and wife, married woman and a gigolo, married man and a prostitute, all breaking their roles but to distance themselves even more from each other. In process they reveal how the very roles are a sham, that we just play out of habit, convenience and society. It challenges our very lives. Of course, this makes for a very nasty picture but with incredible moments of truth. It is very honest and very depressing and a very hard watch while still being fascinating. Its the kind of picture that you appreciate more than you enjoy.

    From director John Cassavetes (The Killing of a Chinese Bookie), this film from the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book was rated rather well by the critics, so I hoped I would agree with their opinions, as the book has often rewarded me with some great watches I otherwise may not have found. Basically, shot in a style similar to documentary, the marriage of a middle-aged couple is disintegrating and in its final stages, the husband Richard Forst (The Godfather's John Marley) is the one who demands the divorce from Maria (Oscar nominated Lynn Carlin), he is leaving her to be with Jeannie Rapp (The Notebook's Gena Rowlands) and many groups and individuals are coming to see them during this time. After the divorce is filed a company of brash businessmen and prostitutes is who Richard spends a night with, while his wife spends her time with middle-aged her female friends and an ageing free-associating playboy, and then young Chet (Oscar nominated Seymour Cassel) from Detroit. This night is full of conversations that cause tension and confrontations, modern American lifestyle is illustrating from all of this as interests, love lives and emotional/spiritual fulfilment of characters is brought into the situations. Pretty much all the character display dissatisfaction and are deeply happiness with their personal lives and try to cover this up while hanging with their friends putting on a false face, and overall there is no hope in the film at all, it only presumes most people in the world have to realise they may be unhappy in some way. Also starring Fred Draper as Freddie Draper, Val Avery as Jim McCarthy, Dorothy Gulliver as Florence, Joanne Moore Jordan as Louise Draper, Darlene Conley as Billy Mae, Gene Darfler as Joe Jackson and Elizabeth Deering as Stella. The performances by Marley and Rowlands and the supporting cast members are fine, and the direction is also fine, I think the only problem for me was that I couldn't really follow what was going on, apparently the film was meant to last six hours, so it was probably a good idea it was cut down, there were some interesting sequences so overall it was an alright drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen. Good!

    John Cassavetes' second feature of any note after 1959's Shadows, Faces is one of the late director's most daring and experimental films. Telling the story of a disintegrating relationship and the love its members seek in the arms of strangers, the film stars, amongst others, Lynn Carlin, John Marley, Gena Rowlands, and Seymour Cassel. It is shot in black and white and has a freewheeling home video quality - Cassavetes' camera scanning across various "faces", faces blurred, in focus, laughing, and crying. The director's greatest success with the picture rests in his ability to dismantle traditional Hollywood ideas about plot and pacing and still stir up emotion and feeling in the viewer. Cassavetes manages to capture remarkably human and naturalistic performances from his cast (for instance, the way his roving camera captures a shirtless Seymour Cassel chasing flirtatiously after Lynn Carlin through their hotel room, or Lynn Carlin and John Marley rubbing noses together and laughing in a moment of ecstasy), helping the film become more than just a collection of meandering long takes. Essential viewing for anyone looking to explore Cassavetes' work or trace the roots of the current independent film movement. 8/10.

    a film based on Bergman crumbs. cold, ash full, exploration of solitude, desire and masks of escape. a film like a river in profound night of senses. top of director art and characters as dice on velvet beach. a cocktail, a strong cocktail in which humor is part of sadness, fight against yourself - piece of return to womb, the adventure - part of limits, in which revenge, love, desire, need of other are just accidents or small lights of dusty candle.honest picture of fall and Utopian freedom.combination of faces, gestures and refuges. and gray circle of different self definition. a masterpiece far by every definition. and form to describe an empty world in its sunrise.

    This is obviously not your average, everyday movie. It's some thing you could only watch at an art-house theater, so clearly this movie is not for just everyone. John Cassavetes was a sort of guerrilla film-maker. His movies never felt like it had any storyboards or were rehearsed in any way. There was never a pre-setup plan, concerning any of its camera-work or positions and the actors all also seemed to be ad-libbing at points. They were just simply shooting away, which gives the movie a very raw and authentic feeling. I think this is the foremost reason why people really like his movies. I myself can appreciate it but that doesn't mean I'm that fond or impressed with it as well. No, it's not really an easy or pleasant movie to watch. It's because the story is not really following a clear main plot line and things just seem to happen very randomly. I just simply prefer a more clear and straightforward story, since it also seemed to me that because of Cassavetes' approach, some of the sequences seemed to go on for ever and often weren't making that much sense for the story either. I can still understand the story and what Cassavetes was trying to do and tell with it. It's basically a look into married life and not about any of its peachy or happy aspects. But however, like I mentioned before, I would had been more taken by it and probably would had find the story to be a more interesting one, if it had a more straightforward story and approach to it. But yet I never hated watching this movie either. I can still definitely appreciate the way it got made and also all of the actors were a joy to watch. The movie really has some fine actors in it and I was especially fond of John Marley's performance. It were however Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel who received an Oscar nomination for their roles in this move. Actually it seems quite amazing to me how this movie managed to score 3 Oscar nominations, since it's such an artistic movie, that normally would hardly get ever noticed or recognized by any of the big award shows. It perhaps says something about the popularity or status of director and writer John Cassavetes at the time or how people looked at movies. For most people this movie will probably be too tough to bite through, or it simply won't be interesting enough to sit through but there is still a large crowd for these sort of movies out there. So if it sounds like it's your thing, chances are you'll probably end up loving it. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Despite the very, very positive reviews for this film, this film is NOT for everyone. I think had the film been shown to a hundred people and they reviewed and scored it, it would have been a lot lower--and with a WIDELY skewed distribution. People would either love it or hate it. However, the average person also would not just pick up a film directed by John Cassavetes. They might love him in "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby"--but these are his commercial projects and ones in which he only acted. His own films are very personal and don't even attempt to be commercial but are artsy and often about topics that aren't all that marketable. The bottom line is that he did films he loved to make and didn't seem to care if the public embraced them--at least that's the perception most people 'in the know' have of his movies. When "Faces" first begins, it's VERY obvious this is not a Hollywood film (this would also be pretty clear if you just read the IMDb summary of the film). The movie is an example of 'Cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;'--a film technique that is typified by the non-professional and provocative aspects of the film. This film appears to have been shot with a cheap non-professional camera and the print is very grainy. As far and the acting and script goes, it looks like a movie made by friends after they had a few drinks--they appear to think they are quite clever. So, from the look of it, the $275,000 budget seems to be exaggerated--especially since it was, literally, a home-made film--being made in Cassevetes' apartment! As I said, it does not appear to be yet another Hollywood type of film! Now the film does have a few professional actors in it--with Cassavetes' own wife (Gena Rowlands) and John Marley starring in the movie. Most of the rest are mostly unknowns--and I have no idea if they were professional actors or just acquaintances of Cassavetes. While I like some French New Wave films, some absurdist films and and even some experimental and Dogma 95 films, I really did not enjoy this particular film. While I am not at all a typical viewer, I clearly don't fall into the very small but wildly enthusiastic crowd of Cassavetes fans. I just found it all to be cheap and pretentious...and dull. To each his or her own.

    It's actually quite laughable how Cassavetes, a.k.a the self-proclaimed American Fellini, refers to his work as the American 'Dolce Vita.' I promise, it did make me laugh when I finished watching this "astonishing" piece of nonsense. You see, Fellini was known for his ability to transform any ordinary scenes or circumstances into genuine entertainment, and he still somehow managed to keep the magic real. What he created was never boring. While 'Faces.' Well. It just looks like a failed attempt to portray some wealthy middle-aged characters and some pretty hookers in a classy glamorized environment and make it somewhat entertaining. It's like they wanted to make 'Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf' but failed. The dialogs are unrealistic and the script is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Sometimes it unintentionally looked like a comic book -Particularly, that scene where Chet jumps out the window half-naked escaping John's grasp or the bit where Maria is resuscitated by Chet and starts breathing again and coughing as she's just returned back from hell and Chet shoves a cigarette down her throat and starts a presumptuous monologue about his existence like she's his damn analyst or something- And that would be the best of it. The worst. Well, the worst would be the teeth grinding boredom, the layer of misogyny, and the excess of fake laughter. The latter would be particularly annoying. The important thing here to learn is that there's nothing original or remarkable about this film.

    John Cassavetes' drama shows the breaking point of a long-disintegrating marriage between Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin). At the start of the film, Richard joins his lifelong friend in the home of prostitute Jeannie (Gena Rowlands), where the two sing and dance, and drunkenly make fools of themselves as they try to impress her. He goes home to his wife and the two joke, only for Richard to suddenly announce his desire for a divorce. He goes back to Jeannie, who is now entertaining two businessmen. Maria goes out with her friends and they pick up optimistic dancer Chet (Seymour Cassel). He charms her friends and the two end up alone, where their desire for intimacy brings them together. Cassavetes, known as the pioneer of American independent film-making, is at his most cold here. We are forced to watch these often repulsive characters laugh and interact without ever really connecting. Most of the men in the film are unhappily married and try to fill the void by committing adultery. All they seem to be doing is distancing themselves more from their wives, and increasing the loathing they truly have for themselves. It's a stroke of genius how over the course of two hours, we get to fully understand the mechanics of Robert's and Maria's marriage, even though they only spend about 15 minutes of screen time together. We get to experience it through a facial expression, or a certain glance, or a line of dialogue. Filmed in the style of cinema verite, a device used most successfully by documentary film-makers The Maysles Brothers, Cassavates deploys it to truly get underneath the skin of the characters. We get to see the characters mainly in close-up, and although we are forced to swallow their meandering and dull conversations, the film never feels intimate. And this is the point. These people seem to exist for themselves, and although they communicate, they only really talk to themselves. The title Faces seems like a clever joke. All these people are, are faces. The director's true intentions come out in one of the final scenes, as Chet talks about how mechanical society is, and how everyone longs for, but is terrified, of intimacy. A truly great American drama featuring expert performances, namely from the Oscar-nominated Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    In reviewing writer-director John Cassavetes' cinema verite-styled "Faces" for the New Yorker, film critic Pauline Kael was more interested in the theater audience's reaction to the picture than the picture itself. She noted that everyone in the crowd seemed to accept this "bad office party" with the utmost seriousness, as if what they were witnessing was extremely personal and important. "Faces" is probably still quite important to revolutionary filmmakers, but it doesn't feel very personal. Cassavetes views a sad, crumbling, upper-class marriage between a businessman and a housewife in Los Angeles with blank eyes. The conversation between the two is vapid and disconnected--and later, when the couple separates and he finds company with a prostitute while she brings home a gigolo, the dialogue remains flat and monotonous. Is Cassavetes trying to say that some marriages become zombie-fied to the point where no amount of conversation breaks through? The wife overdoses on pills and is rescued by the stud, but when the husband comes back and sees the bottle and the mess in the bathroom, he doesn't even ask her about it. The film is stultified by its need to be raw and uncompromising in an arty fashion (with Mount Rushmore-like close-ups of the four principals, a gambit which gets tiresome). Flickers of truth permeate the production, though it isn't very well-shot or lighted, and the editing (purposefully) allows scenes to ramble on passed their emotional peak. ** from ****

I just simply prefer a more clear and straightforward story, since it also seemed to me that because of Cassavetes' approach, some of the sequences seemed to go on for ever and often weren't making that much sense for the story either. I can still understand the story and what Cassavetes was trying to do and tell with it. It's basically a look into married life and not about any of its peachy or happy aspects. But however, like I mentioned before, I would had been more taken by it and probably would had find the story to be a more interesting one, if it had a more straightforward story and approach to it. But yet I never hated watching this movie either. I can still definitely appreciate the way it got made and also all of the actors were a joy to watch. The movie really has some fine actors in it and I was especially fond of John Marley's performance. It were however Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel who received an Oscar nomination for their roles in this move. Actually it seems quite amazing to me how this movie managed to score 3 Oscar nominations, since it's such an artistic movie, that normally would hardly get ever noticed or recognized by any of the big award shows. It perhaps says something about the popularity or status of director and writer John Cassavetes at the time or how people looked at movies. For most people this movie will probably be too tough to bite through, or it simply won't be interesting enough to sit through but there is still a large crowd for these sort of movies out there. So if it sounds like it's your thing, chances are you'll probably end up loving it. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Despite the very, very positive reviews for this film, this film is NOT for everyone. I think had the film been shown to a hundred people and they reviewed and scored it, it would have been a lot lower--and with a WIDELY skewed distribution. People would either love it or hate it. However, the average person also would not just pick up a film directed by John Cassavetes. They might love him in "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby"--but these are his commercial projects and ones in which he only acted. His own films are very personal and don't even attempt to be commercial but are artsy and often about topics that aren't all that marketable. The bottom line is that he did films he loved to make and didn't seem to care if the public embraced them--at least that's the perception most people 'in the know' have of his movies. When "Faces" first begins, it's VERY obvious this is not a Hollywood film (this would also be pretty clear if you just read the IMDb summary of the film). The movie is an example of 'Cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;'--a film technique that is typified by the non-professional and provocative aspects of the film. This film appears to have been shot with a cheap non-professional camera and the print is very grainy. As far and the acting and script goes, it looks like a movie made by friends after they had a few drinks--they appear to think they are quite clever. So, from the look of it, the $275,000 budget seems to be exaggerated--especially since it was, literally, a home-made film--being made in Cassevetes' apartment! As I said, it does not appear to be yet another Hollywood type of film! Now the film does have a few professional actors in it--with Cassavetes' own wife (Gena Rowlands) and John Marley starring in the movie. Most of the rest are mostly unknowns--and I have no idea if they were professional actors or just acquaintances of Cassavetes. While I like some French New Wave films, some absurdist films and and even some experimental and Dogma 95 films, I really did not enjoy this particular film. While I am not at all a typical viewer, I clearly don't fall into the very small but wildly enthusiastic crowd of Cassavetes fans. I just found it all to be cheap and pretentious...and dull. To each his or her own.

    It's actually quite laughable how Cassavetes, a.k.a the self-proclaimed American Fellini, refers to his work as the American 'Dolce Vita.' I promise, it did make me laugh when I finished watching this "astonishing" piece of nonsense. You see, Fellini was known for his ability to transform any ordinary scenes or circumstances into genuine entertainment, and he still somehow managed to keep the magic real. What he created was never boring. While 'Faces.' Well. It just looks like a failed attempt to portray some wealthy middle-aged characters and some pretty hookers in a classy glamorized environment and make it somewhat entertaining. It's like they wanted to make 'Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf' but failed. The dialogs are unrealistic and the script is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Sometimes it unintentionally looked like a comic book -Particularly, that scene where Chet jumps out the window half-naked escaping John's grasp or the bit where Maria is resuscitated by Chet and starts breathing again and coughing as she's just returned back from hell and Chet shoves a cigarette down her throat and starts a presumptuous monologue about his existence like she's his damn analyst or something- And that would be the best of it. The worst. Well, the worst would be the teeth grinding boredom, the layer of misogyny, and the excess of fake laughter. The latter would be particularly annoying. The important thing here to learn is that there's nothing original or remarkable about this film.

    John Cassavetes' drama shows the breaking point of a long-disintegrating marriage between Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin). At the start of the film, Richard joins his lifelong friend in the home of prostitute Jeannie (Gena Rowlands), where the two sing and dance, and drunkenly make fools of themselves as they try to impress her. He goes home to his wife and the two joke, only for Richard to suddenly announce his desire for a divorce. He goes back to Jeannie, who is now entertaining two businessmen. Maria goes out with her friends and they pick up optimistic dancer Chet (Seymour Cassel). He charms her friends and the two end up alone, where their desire for intimacy brings them together. Cassavetes, known as the pioneer of American independent film-making, is at his most cold here. We are forced to watch these often repulsive characters laugh and interact without ever really connecting. Most of the men in the film are unhappily married and try to fill the void by committing adultery. All they seem to be doing is distancing themselves more from their wives, and increasing the loathing they truly have for themselves. It's a stroke of genius how over the course of two hours, we get to fully understand the mechanics of Robert's and Maria's marriage, even though they only spend about 15 minutes of screen time together. We get to experience it through a facial expression, or a certain glance, or a line of dialogue. Filmed in the style of cinema verite, a device used most successfully by documentary film-makers The Maysles Brothers, Cassavates deploys it to truly get underneath the skin of the characters. We get to see the characters mainly in close-up, and although we are forced to swallow their meandering and dull conversations, the film never feels intimate. And this is the point. These people seem to exist for themselves, and although they communicate, they only really talk to themselves. The title Faces seems like a clever joke. All these people are, are faces. The director's true intentions come out in one of the final scenes, as Chet talks about how mechanical society is, and how everyone longs for, but is terrified, of intimacy. A truly great American drama featuring expert performances, namely from the Oscar-nominated Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    In reviewing writer-director John Cassavetes' cinema verite-styled "Faces" for the New Yorker, film critic Pauline Kael was more interested in the theater audience's reaction to the picture than the picture itself. She noted that everyone in the crowd seemed to accept this "bad office party" with the utmost seriousness, as if what they were witnessing was extremely personal and important. "Faces" is probably still quite important to revolutionary filmmakers, but it doesn't feel very personal. Cassavetes views a sad, crumbling, upper-class marriage between a businessman and a housewife in Los Angeles with blank eyes. The conversation between the two is vapid and disconnected--and later, when the couple separates and he finds company with a prostitute while she brings home a gigolo, the dialogue remains flat and monotonous. Is Cassavetes trying to say that some marriages become zombie-fied to the point where no amount of conversation breaks through? The wife overdoses on pills and is rescued by the stud, but when the husband comes back and sees the bottle and the mess in the bathroom, he doesn't even ask her about it. The film is stultified by its need to be raw and uncompromising in an arty fashion (with Mount Rushmore-like close-ups of the four principals, a gambit which gets tiresome). Flickers of truth permeate the production, though it isn't very well-shot or lighted, and the editing (purposefully) allows scenes to ramble on passed their emotional peak. ** from ****

    In John Cassavettes' "Faces," Richard Forst (John Marley), a successful L.A. businessman, asks his wife, Maria (Lynn Carlin), for a divorce. Forst leaves his house and goes to see his mistress, Jeannie Rapp (Gena Rowlands), a prostitute who is still entertaining a couple of business clients (Val Avery; Gene Darfler) when he gets there. Meanwhile, Maria goes out with some friends to a nightclub (appropriately called "The Losers") that is filled with loud rock music. They meet Chet (Seymour Cassel), a young macho stud from Detroit, and bring him back home to Maria's house. After her friends go home sobbing over their lost youth, Maria goes to bed with Chet. The next morning, Maria attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Watching "Faces" is like being locked in a room for two hours with a bunch of loud, obnoxious, drunken people that you don't really like. The characters alternate between telling stupid, childish jokes and laughing hysterically, then dancing around the room while singing annoying song lyrics over and over again (i.e. "I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair"), then arguing with each other, being caustic and cruel to the point of physical violence. Yes, I'm sure there are real people like this, but fortunately, I personally don't know any people who are like these characters. (At least, I *hope* I don't.) Much has been made of the movie's "realistic" style, with its hand-held camera and 16 mm black & white look. This style has influenced everyone from Woody Allen to Robert Altman to today's independent filmmakers. But the fact that the style is good doesn't mean the *movie* is good. I know that some people (particularly film critics) enjoy this type of movie. Some people enjoy flagellation, but that doesn't mean you want to participate in it. This is one of those movies that you watch once, and then  if you're lucky  you forget about it. One line from the movie did make me laugh out loud: Maria: There's a Bergman film in the neighborhood. Richard: I don't feel like getting depressed tonight. Really! You could've fooled me!

    All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players. - Shakespeare. To really understand the above statement you have to actually see the instances when the players refuse to play their parts, even if momentarily. Renoir did it in "La R&egrave;gle du jeu". People playing different roles - master and servant, husband and lover, poacher and grounds-keeper, break for their roles and connect with each other. It is one of the most beautiful movies ever made and has been in AFI Top 10 since it was released. Faces is the anti-thesis of "La R&egrave;gle du jeu". Here to the player stop playing their parts but instead of connecting with each other, they distance themselves from each other. So we have husband and wife, married woman and a gigolo, married man and a prostitute, all breaking their roles but to distance themselves even more from each other. In process they reveal how the very roles are a sham, that we just play out of habit, convenience and society. It challenges our very lives. Of course, this makes for a very nasty picture but with incredible moments of truth. It is very honest and very depressing and a very hard watch while still being fascinating. Its the kind of picture that you appreciate more than you enjoy.

    From director John Cassavetes (The Killing of a Chinese Bookie), this film from the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book was rated rather well by the critics, so I hoped I would agree with their opinions, as the book has often rewarded me with some great watches I otherwise may not have found. Basically, shot in a style similar to documentary, the marriage of a middle-aged couple is disintegrating and in its final stages, the husband Richard Forst (The Godfather's John Marley) is the one who demands the divorce from Maria (Oscar nominated Lynn Carlin), he is leaving her to be with Jeannie Rapp (The Notebook's Gena Rowlands) and many groups and individuals are coming to see them during this time. After the divorce is filed a company of brash businessmen and prostitutes is who Richard spends a night with, while his wife spends her time with middle-aged her female friends and an ageing free-associating playboy, and then young Chet (Oscar nominated Seymour Cassel) from Detroit. This night is full of conversations that cause tension and confrontations, modern American lifestyle is illustrating from all of this as interests, love lives and emotional/spiritual fulfilment of characters is brought into the situations. Pretty much all the character display dissatisfaction and are deeply happiness with their personal lives and try to cover this up while hanging with their friends putting on a false face, and overall there is no hope in the film at all, it only presumes most people in the world have to realise they may be unhappy in some way. Also starring Fred Draper as Freddie Draper, Val Avery as Jim McCarthy, Dorothy Gulliver as Florence, Joanne Moore Jordan as Louise Draper, Darlene Conley as Billy Mae, Gene Darfler as Joe Jackson and Elizabeth Deering as Stella. The performances by Marley and Rowlands and the supporting cast members are fine, and the direction is also fine, I think the only problem for me was that I couldn't really follow what was going on, apparently the film was meant to last six hours, so it was probably a good idea it was cut down, there were some interesting sequences so overall it was an alright drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen. Good!

    John Cassavetes' second feature of any note after 1959's Shadows, Faces is one of the late director's most daring and experimental films. Telling the story of a disintegrating relationship and the love its members seek in the arms of strangers, the film stars, amongst others, Lynn Carlin, John Marley, Gena Rowlands, and Seymour Cassel. It is shot in black and white and has a freewheeling home video quality - Cassavetes' camera scanning across various "faces", faces blurred, in focus, laughing, and crying. The director's greatest success with the picture rests in his ability to dismantle traditional Hollywood ideas about plot and pacing and still stir up emotion and feeling in the viewer. Cassavetes manages to capture remarkably human and naturalistic performances from his cast (for instance, the way his roving camera captures a shirtless Seymour Cassel chasing flirtatiously after Lynn Carlin through their hotel room, or Lynn Carlin and John Marley rubbing noses together and laughing in a moment of ecstasy), helping the film become more than just a collection of meandering long takes. Essential viewing for anyone looking to explore Cassavetes' work or trace the roots of the current independent film movement. 8/10.

    This is obviously not your average, everyday movie. It's some thing you could only watch at an art-house theater, so clearly this movie is not for just everyone. John Cassavetes was a sort of guerrilla film-maker. His movies never felt like it had any storyboards or were rehearsed in any way. There was never a pre-setup plan, concerning any of its camera-work or positions and the actors all also seemed to be ad-libbing at points. They were just simply shooting away, which gives the movie a very raw and authentic feeling. I think this is the foremost reason why people really like his movies. I myself can appreciate it but that doesn't mean I'm that fond or impressed with it as well. No, it's not really an easy or pleasant movie to watch. It's because the story is not really following a clear main plot line and things just seem to happen very randomly. I just simply prefer a more clear and straightforward story, since it also seemed to me that because of Cassavetes' approach, some of the sequences seemed to go on for ever and often weren't making that much sense for the story either. I can still understand the story and what Cassavetes was trying to do and tell with it. It's basically a look into married life and not about any of its peachy or happy aspects. But however, like I mentioned before, I would had been more taken by it and probably would had find the story to be a more interesting one, if it had a more straightforward story and approach to it.

So if it sounds like it's your thing, chances are you'll probably end up loving it. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Despite the very, very positive reviews for this film, this film is NOT for everyone. I think had the film been shown to a hundred people and they reviewed and scored it, it would have been a lot lower--and with a WIDELY skewed distribution. People would either love it or hate it. However, the average person also would not just pick up a film directed by John Cassavetes. They might love him in "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby"--but these are his commercial projects and ones in which he only acted.

    In John Cassavettes' "Faces," Richard Forst (John Marley), a successful L.A. businessman, asks his wife, Maria (Lynn Carlin), for a divorce. Forst leaves his house and goes to see his mistress, Jeannie Rapp (Gena Rowlands), a prostitute who is still entertaining a couple of business clients (Val Avery; Gene Darfler) when he gets there. Meanwhile, Maria goes out with some friends to a nightclub (appropriately called "The Losers") that is filled with loud rock music. They meet Chet (Seymour Cassel), a young macho stud from Detroit, and bring him back home to Maria's house. After her friends go home sobbing over their lost youth, Maria goes to bed with Chet. The next morning, Maria attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Watching "Faces" is like being locked in a room for two hours with a bunch of loud, obnoxious, drunken people that you don't really like.

Yes, I'm sure there are real people like this, but fortunately, I personally don't know any people who are like these characters. (At least, I *hope* I don't.) Much has been made of the movie's "realistic" style, with its hand-held camera and 16 mm black & white look. This style has influenced everyone from Woody Allen to Robert Altman to today's independent filmmakers. But the fact that the style is good doesn't mean the *movie* is good. I know that some people (particularly film critics) enjoy this type of movie. Some people enjoy flagellation, but that doesn't mean you want to participate in it. This is one of those movies that you watch once, and then  if you're lucky  you forget about it. One line from the movie did make me laugh out loud: Maria: There's a Bergman film in the neighborhood. Richard: I don't feel like getting depressed tonight. Really! You could've fooled me!

    All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players. - Shakespeare. To really understand the above statement you have to actually see the instances when the players refuse to play their parts, even if momentarily. Renoir did it in "La R&egrave;gle du jeu". People playing different roles - master and servant, husband and lover, poacher and grounds-keeper, break for their roles and connect with each other. It is one of the most beautiful movies ever made and has been in AFI Top 10 since it was released. Faces is the anti-thesis of "La R&egrave;gle du jeu". Here to the player stop playing their parts but instead of connecting with each other, they distance themselves from each other. So we have husband and wife, married woman and a gigolo, married man and a prostitute, all breaking their roles but to distance themselves even more from each other. In process they reveal how the very roles are a sham, that we just play out of habit, convenience and society. It challenges our very lives. Of course, this makes for a very nasty picture but with incredible moments of truth. It is very honest and very depressing and a very hard watch while still being fascinating. Its the kind of picture that you appreciate more than you enjoy.

    From director John Cassavetes (The Killing of a Chinese Bookie), this film from the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book was rated rather well by the critics, so I hoped I would agree with their opinions, as the book has often rewarded me with some great watches I otherwise may not have found. Basically, shot in a style similar to documentary, the marriage of a middle-aged couple is disintegrating and in its final stages, the husband Richard Forst (The Godfather's John Marley) is the one who demands the divorce from Maria (Oscar nominated Lynn Carlin), he is leaving her to be with Jeannie Rapp (The Notebook's Gena Rowlands) and many groups and individuals are coming to see them during this time. After the divorce is filed a company of brash businessmen and prostitutes is who Richard spends a night with, while his wife spends her time with middle-aged her female friends and an ageing free-associating playboy, and then young Chet (Oscar nominated Seymour Cassel) from Detroit. This night is full of conversations that cause tension and confrontations, modern American lifestyle is illustrating from all of this as interests, love lives and emotional/spiritual fulfilment of characters is brought into the situations. Pretty much all the character display dissatisfaction and are deeply happiness with their personal lives and try to cover this up while hanging with their friends putting on a false face, and overall there is no hope in the film at all, it only presumes most people in the world have to realise they may be unhappy in some way. Also starring Fred Draper as Freddie Draper, Val Avery as Jim McCarthy, Dorothy Gulliver as Florence, Joanne Moore Jordan as Louise Draper, Darlene Conley as Billy Mae, Gene Darfler as Joe Jackson and Elizabeth Deering as Stella. The performances by Marley and Rowlands and the supporting cast members are fine, and the direction is also fine, I think the only problem for me was that I couldn't really follow what was going on, apparently the film was meant to last six hours, so it was probably a good idea it was cut down, there were some interesting sequences so overall it was an alright drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen. Good!

    John Cassavetes' second feature of any note after 1959's Shadows, Faces is one of the late director's most daring and experimental films. Telling the story of a disintegrating relationship and the love its members seek in the arms of strangers, the film stars, amongst others, Lynn Carlin, John Marley, Gena Rowlands, and Seymour Cassel. It is shot in black and white and has a freewheeling home video quality - Cassavetes' camera scanning across various "faces", faces blurred, in focus, laughing, and crying. The director's greatest success with the picture rests in his ability to dismantle traditional Hollywood ideas about plot and pacing and still stir up emotion and feeling in the viewer. Cassavetes manages to capture remarkably human and naturalistic performances from his cast (for instance, the way his roving camera captures a shirtless Seymour Cassel chasing flirtatiously after Lynn Carlin through their hotel room, or Lynn Carlin and John Marley rubbing noses together and laughing in a moment of ecstasy), helping the film become more than just a collection of meandering long takes. Essential viewing for anyone looking to explore Cassavetes' work or trace the roots of the current independent film movement. 8/10.

    a film based on Bergman crumbs. cold, ash full, exploration of solitude, desire and masks of escape. a film like a river in profound night of senses. top of director art and characters as dice on velvet beach. a cocktail, a strong cocktail in which humor is part of sadness, fight against yourself - piece of return to womb, the adventure - part of limits, in which revenge, love, desire, need of other are just accidents or small lights of dusty candle.honest picture of fall and Utopian freedom.combination of faces, gestures and refuges. and gray circle of different self definition. a masterpiece far by every definition. and form to describe an empty world in its sunrise.

    This is obviously not your average, everyday movie. It's some thing you could only watch at an art-house theater, so clearly this movie is not for just everyone. John Cassavetes was a sort of guerrilla film-maker. His movies never felt like it had any storyboards or were rehearsed in any way. There was never a pre-setup plan, concerning any of its camera-work or positions and the actors all also seemed to be ad-libbing at points. They were just simply shooting away, which gives the movie a very raw and authentic feeling. I think this is the foremost reason why people really like his movies. I myself can appreciate it but that doesn't mean I'm that fond or impressed with it as well. No, it's not really an easy or pleasant movie to watch. It's because the story is not really following a clear main plot line and things just seem to happen very randomly. I just simply prefer a more clear and straightforward story, since it also seemed to me that because of Cassavetes' approach, some of the sequences seemed to go on for ever and often weren't making that much sense for the story either. I can still understand the story and what Cassavetes was trying to do and tell with it. It's basically a look into married life and not about any of its peachy or happy aspects. But however, like I mentioned before, I would had been more taken by it and probably would had find the story to be a more interesting one, if it had a more straightforward story and approach to it. But yet I never hated watching this movie either. I can still definitely appreciate the way it got made and also all of the actors were a joy to watch. The movie really has some fine actors in it and I was especially fond of John Marley's performance. It were however Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel who received an Oscar nomination for their roles in this move. Actually it seems quite amazing to me how this movie managed to score 3 Oscar nominations, since it's such an artistic movie, that normally would hardly get ever noticed or recognized by any of the big award shows. It perhaps says something about the popularity or status of director and writer John Cassavetes at the time or how people looked at movies. For most people this movie will probably be too tough to bite through, or it simply won't be interesting enough to sit through but there is still a large crowd for these sort of movies out there. So if it sounds like it's your thing, chances are you'll probably end up loving it. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Despite the very, very positive reviews for this film, this film is NOT for everyone. I think had the film been shown to a hundred people and they reviewed and scored it, it would have been a lot lower--and with a WIDELY skewed distribution. People would either love it or hate it. However, the average person also would not just pick up a film directed by John Cassavetes. They might love him in "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby"--but these are his commercial projects and ones in which he only acted. His own films are very personal and don't even attempt to be commercial but are artsy and often about topics that aren't all that marketable. The bottom line is that he did films he loved to make and didn't seem to care if the public embraced them--at least that's the perception most people 'in the know' have of his movies. When "Faces" first begins, it's VERY obvious this is not a Hollywood film (this would also be pretty clear if you just read the IMDb summary of the film). The movie is an example of 'Cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;'--a film technique that is typified by the non-professional and provocative aspects of the film. This film appears to have been shot with a cheap non-professional camera and the print is very grainy. As far and the acting and script goes, it looks like a movie made by friends after they had a few drinks--they appear to think they are quite clever. So, from the look of it, the $275,000 budget seems to be exaggerated--especially since it was, literally, a home-made film--being made in Cassevetes' apartment! As I said, it does not appear to be yet another Hollywood type of film! Now the film does have a few professional actors in it--with Cassavetes' own wife (Gena Rowlands) and John Marley starring in the movie. Most of the rest are mostly unknowns--and I have no idea if they were professional actors or just acquaintances of Cassavetes. While I like some French New Wave films, some absurdist films and and even some experimental and Dogma 95 films, I really did not enjoy this particular film. While I am not at all a typical viewer, I clearly don't fall into the very small but wildly enthusiastic crowd of Cassavetes fans. I just found it all to be cheap and pretentious...and dull. To each his or her own.

    It's actually quite laughable how Cassavetes, a.k.a the self-proclaimed American Fellini, refers to his work as the American 'Dolce Vita.' I promise, it did make me laugh when I finished watching this "astonishing" piece of nonsense. You see, Fellini was known for his ability to transform any ordinary scenes or circumstances into genuine entertainment, and he still somehow managed to keep the magic real. What he created was never boring. While 'Faces.' Well. It just looks like a failed attempt to portray some wealthy middle-aged characters and some pretty hookers in a classy glamorized environment and make it somewhat entertaining. It's like they wanted to make 'Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf' but failed. The dialogs are unrealistic and the script is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Sometimes it unintentionally looked like a comic book -Particularly, that scene where Chet jumps out the window half-naked escaping John's grasp or the bit where Maria is resuscitated by Chet and starts breathing again and coughing as she's just returned back from hell and Chet shoves a cigarette down her throat and starts a presumptuous monologue about his existence like she's his damn analyst or something- And that would be the best of it. The worst. Well, the worst would be the teeth grinding boredom, the layer of misogyny, and the excess of fake laughter. The latter would be particularly annoying. The important thing here to learn is that there's nothing original or remarkable about this film.

    John Cassavetes' drama shows the breaking point of a long-disintegrating marriage between Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin). At the start of the film, Richard joins his lifelong friend in the home of prostitute Jeannie (Gena Rowlands), where the two sing and dance, and drunkenly make fools of themselves as they try to impress her. He goes home to his wife and the two joke, only for Richard to suddenly announce his desire for a divorce. He goes back to Jeannie, who is now entertaining two businessmen. Maria goes out with her friends and they pick up optimistic dancer Chet (Seymour Cassel). He charms her friends and the two end up alone, where their desire for intimacy brings them together. Cassavetes, known as the pioneer of American independent film-making, is at his most cold here. We are forced to watch these often repulsive characters laugh and interact without ever really connecting. Most of the men in the film are unhappily married and try to fill the void by committing adultery. All they seem to be doing is distancing themselves more from their wives, and increasing the loathing they truly have for themselves. It's a stroke of genius how over the course of two hours, we get to fully understand the mechanics of Robert's and Maria's marriage, even though they only spend about 15 minutes of screen time together. We get to experience it through a facial expression, or a certain glance, or a line of dialogue. Filmed in the style of cinema verite, a device used most successfully by documentary film-makers The Maysles Brothers, Cassavates deploys it to truly get underneath the skin of the characters. We get to see the characters mainly in close-up, and although we are forced to swallow their meandering and dull conversations, the film never feels intimate. And this is the point. These people seem to exist for themselves, and although they communicate, they only really talk to themselves. The title Faces seems like a clever joke. All these people are, are faces. The director's true intentions come out in one of the final scenes, as Chet talks about how mechanical society is, and how everyone longs for, but is terrified, of intimacy. A truly great American drama featuring expert performances, namely from the Oscar-nominated Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    In reviewing writer-director John Cassavetes' cinema verite-styled "Faces" for the New Yorker, film critic Pauline Kael was more interested in the theater audience's reaction to the picture than the picture itself. She noted that everyone in the crowd seemed to accept this "bad office party" with the utmost seriousness, as if what they were witnessing was extremely personal and important. "Faces" is probably still quite important to revolutionary filmmakers, but it doesn't feel very personal. Cassavetes views a sad, crumbling, upper-class marriage between a businessman and a housewife in Los Angeles with blank eyes. The conversation between the two is vapid and disconnected--and later, when the couple separates and he finds company with a prostitute while she brings home a gigolo, the dialogue remains flat and monotonous. Is Cassavetes trying to say that some marriages become zombie-fied to the point where no amount of conversation breaks through? The wife overdoses on pills and is rescued by the stud, but when the husband comes back and sees the bottle and the mess in the bathroom, he doesn't even ask her about it. The film is stultified by its need to be raw and uncompromising in an arty fashion (with Mount Rushmore-like close-ups of the four principals, a gambit which gets tiresome). Flickers of truth permeate the production, though it isn't very well-shot or lighted, and the editing (purposefully) allows scenes to ramble on passed their emotional peak. ** from ****

    In John Cassavettes' "Faces," Richard Forst (John Marley), a successful L.A. businessman, asks his wife, Maria (Lynn Carlin), for a divorce. Forst leaves his house and goes to see his mistress, Jeannie Rapp (Gena Rowlands), a prostitute who is still entertaining a couple of business clients (Val Avery; Gene Darfler) when he gets there. Meanwhile, Maria goes out with some friends to a nightclub (appropriately called "The Losers") that is filled with loud rock music. They meet Chet (Seymour Cassel), a young macho stud from Detroit, and bring him back home to Maria's house. After her friends go home sobbing over their lost youth, Maria goes to bed with Chet. The next morning, Maria attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Watching "Faces" is like being locked in a room for two hours with a bunch of loud, obnoxious, drunken people that you don't really like. The characters alternate between telling stupid, childish jokes and laughing hysterically, then dancing around the room while singing annoying song lyrics over and over again (i.e. "I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair"), then arguing with each other, being caustic and cruel to the point of physical violence. Yes, I'm sure there are real people like this, but fortunately, I personally don't know any people who are like these characters. (At least, I *hope* I don't.) Much has been made of the movie's "realistic" style, with its hand-held camera and 16 mm black & white look. This style has influenced everyone from Woody Allen to Robert Altman to today's independent filmmakers. But the fact that the style is good doesn't mean the *movie* is good. I know that some people (particularly film critics) enjoy this type of movie. Some people enjoy flagellation, but that doesn't mean you want to participate in it. This is one of those movies that you watch once, and then  if you're lucky  you forget about it. One line from the movie did make me laugh out loud: Maria: There's a Bergman film in the neighborhood. Richard: I don't feel like getting depressed tonight. Really! You could've fooled me!

It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen. Good!

As far and the acting and script goes, it looks like a movie made by friends after they had a few drinks--they appear to think they are quite clever. So, from the look of it, the $275,000 budget seems to be exaggerated--especially since it was, literally, a home-made film--being made in Cassevetes' apartment! As I said, it does not appear to be yet another Hollywood type of film! Now the film does have a few professional actors in it--with Cassavetes' own wife (Gena Rowlands) and John Marley starring in the movie. Most of the rest are mostly unknowns--and I have no idea if they were professional actors or just acquaintances of Cassavetes. While I like some French New Wave films, some absurdist films and and even some experimental and Dogma 95 films, I really did not enjoy this particular film. While I am not at all a typical viewer, I clearly don't fall into the very small but wildly enthusiastic crowd of Cassavetes fans. I just found it all to be cheap and pretentious...and dull. To each his or her own.

    It's actually quite laughable how Cassavetes, a.k.a the self-proclaimed American Fellini, refers to his work as the American 'Dolce Vita.' I promise, it did make me laugh when I finished watching this "astonishing" piece of nonsense. You see, Fellini was known for his ability to transform any ordinary scenes or circumstances into genuine entertainment, and he still somehow managed to keep the magic real. What he created was never boring. While 'Faces.' Well. It just looks like a failed attempt to portray some wealthy middle-aged characters and some pretty hookers in a classy glamorized environment and make it somewhat entertaining. It's like they wanted to make 'Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf' but failed. The dialogs are unrealistic and the script is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Sometimes it unintentionally looked like a comic book -Particularly, that scene where Chet jumps out the window half-naked escaping John's grasp or the bit where Maria is resuscitated by Chet and starts breathing again and coughing as she's just returned back from hell and Chet shoves a cigarette down her throat and starts a presumptuous monologue about his existence like she's his damn analyst or something- And that would be the best of it. The worst. Well, the worst would be the teeth grinding boredom, the layer of misogyny, and the excess of fake laughter. The latter would be particularly annoying. The important thing here to learn is that there's nothing original or remarkable about this film.

    John Cassavetes' drama shows the breaking point of a long-disintegrating marriage between Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin). At the start of the film, Richard joins his lifelong friend in the home of prostitute Jeannie (Gena Rowlands), where the two sing and dance, and drunkenly make fools of themselves as they try to impress her. He goes home to his wife and the two joke, only for Richard to suddenly announce his desire for a divorce. He goes back to Jeannie, who is now entertaining two businessmen. Maria goes out with her friends and they pick up optimistic dancer Chet (Seymour Cassel). He charms her friends and the two end up alone, where their desire for intimacy brings them together. Cassavetes, known as the pioneer of American independent film-making, is at his most cold here. We are forced to watch these often repulsive characters laugh and interact without ever really connecting. Most of the men in the film are unhappily married and try to fill the void by committing adultery. All they seem to be doing is distancing themselves more from their wives, and increasing the loathing they truly have for themselves. It's a stroke of genius how over the course of two hours, we get to fully understand the mechanics of Robert's and Maria's marriage, even though they only spend about 15 minutes of screen time together. We get to experience it through a facial expression, or a certain glance, or a line of dialogue. Filmed in the style of cinema verite, a device used most successfully by documentary film-makers The Maysles Brothers, Cassavates deploys it to truly get underneath the skin of the characters. We get to see the characters mainly in close-up, and although we are forced to swallow their meandering and dull conversations, the film never feels intimate. And this is the point. These people seem to exist for themselves, and although they communicate, they only really talk to themselves. The title Faces seems like a clever joke. All these people are, are faces. The director's true intentions come out in one of the final scenes, as Chet talks about how mechanical society is, and how everyone longs for, but is terrified, of intimacy. A truly great American drama featuring expert performances, namely from the Oscar-nominated Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    In reviewing writer-director John Cassavetes' cinema verite-styled "Faces" for the New Yorker, film critic Pauline Kael was more interested in the theater audience's reaction to the picture than the picture itself. She noted that everyone in the crowd seemed to accept this "bad office party" with the utmost seriousness, as if what they were witnessing was extremely personal and important. "Faces" is probably still quite important to revolutionary filmmakers, but it doesn't feel very personal. Cassavetes views a sad, crumbling, upper-class marriage between a businessman and a housewife in Los Angeles with blank eyes. The conversation between the two is vapid and disconnected--and later, when the couple separates and he finds company with a prostitute while she brings home a gigolo, the dialogue remains flat and monotonous. Is Cassavetes trying to say that some marriages become zombie-fied to the point where no amount of conversation breaks through? The wife overdoses on pills and is rescued by the stud, but when the husband comes back and sees the bottle and the mess in the bathroom, he doesn't even ask her about it. The film is stultified by its need to be raw and uncompromising in an arty fashion (with Mount Rushmore-like close-ups of the four principals, a gambit which gets tiresome). Flickers of truth permeate the production, though it isn't very well-shot or lighted, and the editing (purposefully) allows scenes to ramble on passed their emotional peak. ** from ****
