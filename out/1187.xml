    The inner-city, prone to violence, crime, drugs, even sex. The top gang that rules the area are the Silver Daggers. With them are their female counterparts, the Dagger Debs lead by Lace (Robbie Lee). One day, they meet a loner name Maggie (Joanne Nail), who holds her own. After a night in juvenile hall, Maggie joins the ranks and gains the trust of Lace. However, Lace's friend Patch is suspicious of Maggie. As Maggie began to to know the ways of the Dagger Debs, she makes a move on Lace's boyfriend Dominic (Asher Brauner), who would not take the role of a father when he hears about Lace's pregnancy. More to it, Maggie would take in the reins of leading the Dagger Debs following a failed ambush at a roller rink. The men are ousted by Maggie, and they go form the Dagger Debs, to the Jezebels. They even join a militant gang to help boost the power of the group. When Lace re cooperates from her attack, she joins the group, only to suspect Maggie as a traitor. I like the scene where Lace beats up Maggie, and tortures her by sticking a cigarette butt in her bellybutton. Then came the showdown. Classic scene. The gang gains a new leader, while Patch is left behind. Goes to show there is no loyalty among gangs. Power shifts, and questionable leadership can destroy an organization. The Jezebels have not only ousted the men, but Lace as well, without her knowledge. They consider her a weak link in the gang. 4 out of 5 stars.

    Predating the cycle of gang movies by a few years, "The Jezebels" (a.k.a. "Switchblade Sisters") by exploitation icon Jack Hill really is a whole lot of fun. It's colourful entertainment that actually manages to be campy and serious in equal doses. And it does come complete with a feminist statement. Robbie Lee is Lace, the leader of a girl gang dubbed The Dagger Debs, who are affiliated with a male gang known as the Silver Daggers. She's sweet on Dominic (Asher Brauner), their leader. Laces' world starts falling apart when Maggie (Joanne Nail), a loner, attracts the attention of the gangs (especially Dominic) and rises within the ranks - and gains influence - a little too quickly. Amid the personal problems of the main characters, they must go to war with a gang that masquerades as community activists. Considering the fact that some of these actresses don't really convince at all as tough gals (especially Lee), and are clearly too old for their roles, they really are a whole lot of fun. Monica Gayle delivers a standout performance as Patch, a gang member who comes to distrust and despise Maggie. A rich assortment of familiar actors in the supporting roles include Marlene Clark as black revolutionary Muff, Don Stark as Hook, Bill Adler as Fingers, Kate Murtagh as butch lesbian prison guard Mom Smackley, and Bob Minor as police officer Parker. Nail definitely looks very hot in various sexy outfits. Co-star Kitty Bruce, who plays the put-upon Donut, is the daughter of Lenny Bruce. The movie contains some absolute gems of dialogue thanks to screenwriter F.X. Maier; the viewer will find them very quotable. Nails' speech to the cops right before the end credits is hilarious. There's sex and plenty of violence, and some eye catching costumes by Jodie Tillen. And you just know that this is going to a be a most enjoyable film because of the tune "Black Hearted Woman" that's belted out during the opening credits. Many fine scenes include the clich&eacute;d action in the penitentiary and the gunfights at the roller rink and in the streets. Fans of this kind of thing would be well advised to seek it out. It really hits the spot in terms of all of its exploitative elements. Nine out of 10.

    "The Jezebels" is also known as "Switchblade Sisters". And, whatever you call it, it's complete crap. Now this is NOT meant as criticism. It's obvious the folks making this wanted to make a trashy movie and boy did they make a nasty, crappy picture!! It's violent, stupid and even promotes the old rape myth! So, it certainly is not a film to show your mother or Father Jenkins. The film begins with a gang of female punks attacking Maggie in a restaurant. Next thing you know, the ladies are in jail and the leader and intended victim become best friends! Soon, when they are all out of stir, the gang welcomes the newest recruit, Maggie, by raping her. Nice folks, huh? But the victim isn't particularly put out by this and soon she helps them in a gang war. And, before you know it, Maggie is their leader and makes friends with a local lady Black Panthers group and the war is on! But there is a traitor within the gang and Maggie's reign might be coming to a swift end. And, when the film ends, it sure looks as if there will be a sequel--which there wasn't. There really isn't a lot of good in the film. It's super-violent and sadistic and unrepentantly nasty. And, because of that, the film is, in a sick way, quite entertaining---sort of a guilty pleasure if you are a bad movie buff.

Lace (Robbie Lee), the ever tooth-gritting leader, befriends her but soon has doubts -- it seems Lace's man Dominic (Asher Brauner), head of the Silver Daggers, fancies the new recruit. Director Jack Hill, one of my idols and a swell guy, has had some strange things to say about this film. He has said the script was inspired by "Othello", and has also claimed to interview real female gang members before making the movie. And yet, he readily admits the whole thing is a "wacky fantasy"... The film not only has jail, gang fights and more... it has a pregnancy subplot! How do you beat that? While this may be no social commentary, it really does its best to be an exploitation classic (and it comes as no surprise that Quentin Tarantino has been the biggest supporter of this film.)

    Switchblade Sisters (1975) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Trashy cult classic from Jack Hill has new girl Maggie (Joanne Nail) joining up with a female gang being ran by Lace (Robbie Lee) but soon everyone's loyalty is tested when a rival gang causes trouble. If you're looking for a thought-provoking, deep and serious look at females in trouble then it's best you go check out some talky foreign film. If you want sleaze, nudity, violence, cat fights and that sort of thing then Jack Hill's film is just what you're looking for. It's easy to watch this film and realize why it has become a cult favorite over the years because there are just so many classic scenes within the genre. While the film isn't perfect and there are certainly some weak moments, there's still no question that the film contains some of the best scenes from this type of exploitation picture. One such scene happens rather early on when the girls are sentenced to a jail and they come under attack from a large woman who is the boss. What happens during the two attack scenes are just priceless and will have the viewer rolling. Another terrific scene happens towards the middle when there's a violent gun battle at a roller rink. Purely priceless this scene is. The performances aren't what we'd consider "good" but I think everyone fits their roles just fine. This is especially true of Nail and Lee. It's also fun seeing Lenny Bruce's daughter Kitty in the cast as Donut. Hill keeps the film moving at a very good pace and there's all sorts of fun to be had throughout. SWITCHBLADE SISTERS deserves its cult reputation without question.

    SWITCHBLADE SISTERS/THE JEZEBELS- 1976. My friend, Bob, made a connection with the Extras Casting Director at New World Entertainment, in Hollywood, California. I was interviewed and assigned a role as a "cop". My wife was assigned a role as a "street person". We would each earn $20 a day, plus catered meals. Early one morning, we assembled at a defunct Tasty-Freeze Drive-in restaurant in Eagle Rock, CA. I was given a "Metropolitan Police Uniform", a "flack jacket", a helmet and a "Billy Club". My first duty was to drive a "Police Car" full of other "Officers" to the curb in front of the Drive-in. We disembarked and chased after the "Dagger Debs", who had scattered upon our arrival. I located one of the Debs behind a dumpster in the rear of the property. I grabbed her wrist and put a (gentle) Hammerlock on her arm. With my club raised to strike, I marched her towards the camera. Suddenly she snarled, "Let go, you Son-of-a Bitch". Forgetting that she was an actress, I thought I was hurting her, so I released the hold. The Director yelled, "Cut". And that scene went onto the Cutting Room floor! Then, my friend Bob was instructed to frisk another Deb for weapons. Being a very religious, family man, he kept his hands about five inches away from her body. The Director finally yelled for him to," feel her up". He blushed as he complied! My wife (in a blue dress) and two other "street persons" sat at tables in front of the Drive-in when the Debs showed up. The ladies "fled" and the scene was completed. On a subsequent evening, we assembled at a vacant pottery factory in Glendale, CA. This was the clubhouse of the Debs. Following their well-orchestrated Knife Fight, we cops burst into the building. I grabbed one of the girls by her ponytail and pulled her head against the end of a shotgun. (That was cut). Finally, I got a full-face scene as I loaded the girls into the police van. As we rehearsed, I would grab and roughly shove them into the vehicle. But, then I would gently help them down for the next practice. You may notice that my "flack vest" is worn wrong side out. It was very late when I got home, so I got ready for bed in the dark. Only in the morning, did my wife see that my arms were covered with blood (fake)! My wife & I had only observed the filming of our respective scenes, so we looked forward to the movie's release at a theater. We took our 14 year-old son to see it on screen. Holy Smokes! The language, the suggestive body actions  we were so embarrassed! But our son said it was just like Junior Hi-school!

    Jack Hill also did Coffy & did a good job about updating The 1963-era "Birmingham Angel" to Pam Grier. I wonder if Pam Grier remembered, "Birmingham Sunday"? The Jezebels got some reinforcement from a black girl group that followed Mao. However In life I've seen a black girl with a 1955 Packard Clipper beat up a bully in real life back in 1963. The urban assault car came from a 1955 Packard Patrician 4-Dr. Sedan so Jack Hill & I met halfway. Kitty Bruce's Donut was a thankless character, but she was loyal to the end. The Movie was unreal in some parts, but people actually think they can get away with it but in reality check, you get it in the end. If I did the screen writing, The black girl gang led by Muff would be shown as spirits & have 1950s cars with lethal death rays installed in them and poisoned black smoke & the led car would be a 1955 Packard Clipper Sedan & when the black girl gang leave the scene a mist is used and they go into the mist and vanish. And when they unleash there weapons on Crabs' Teen Patrol they would yell: "We didn't forget what happened on Birmingham Sunday, on September 15, 1963 & this one is for Denise McNair & her fellow school girls!" and they would zap The Teen Patrol with death rays & vaporized them & get most of the members. However Crabs gets it by Lace. The movie was good and Jack Hill met me halfway with the urban assault vehicle made from a 1955 Packard & didn't name the leader, "Esther Williams". I liked the movie & it's in my collection. With a girl gang like The Jezebels, they make Charles Starkweather look like Pope John Paul II. That's it for now. Marcus Brainard

    Whoever said Quentin Tarantino doesn't know Exploitation? Well, I guess I did, I mean, really, what exactly was Death Proof (and Planet Terror) supposed to prove? So, Tarantino obviously doesn't know much about recreating B-movies, but the man certainly knows a quality B-movie when he sees it. Quentin Tarantino dug Jack Hill's gritty, mean-spirited, ofter humorous, gangsploitation epic so much that he made it apart of his Rolling Thunder label, and who can blame him? Switchblade Sisters is quality B-entertainment from beginning to end. I could tell I would love this movie as soon a the theme song started. Tough, trashy chicks rock, especially in the 70's. These streets are ran by a male gang, The Silver Daggers, ran by Dominic, and a female gang, the dagger debs, ran by Lace, Dominic's chipmunk-voiced girlfriend. Seemingly a happy couple at first, but after Maggie, the vicious new member of Lace's gang, threatens their relationship, Lace is so wrapped up in vengeance, that she can't even see that her position as leader might also be in question. For any guys out there in the need for something to watch with your feminist girlfriend, look no further, because Switchblade Sisters offers plenty of eye-candy as well as a a strong sense of equality for the ladies. So, any genius's out there thinking of showing the girlfriend I Spit On Your Grave, it won't be necessary. Switchblade Sisters isn't nearly as inept as most Exploitation movies, and it's cool and all that Tarantino released it, but we need a badass release from a real B-movie label, like Something Weird Video, or even Troma. But then again, at least it's out there. Any fans of sleazy Exploitation, sleazy humor, and sleazy women, should find this movie to be nothing short of delightful. Yay for Switchblade Sisters!! 8/10

    The Dagger Debs, tough-talking high school broads with switchblade knives, benevolent snarls, attitude to spare, and propensity for violence, striking fear in the hearts of the citizens on the streets, are on equal footing with a the male Silver Daggers, a bossy, nasty brood whose harsh bullying ways leave the community they frequent cuckolded in a state of quivering angst. Soon a rival gang must attend the Daggers' school due to theirs closing, and a struggle for dominance ensues. Each gang has their own turf, which the other doesn't dare cross into. Crabs, quite old to be still in high school, has a much larger gang than his mortal enemy, Dominick, and runs high enterprise in dope-dealing through the facade of a community organizing group schmoozing with the mayor while selling drugs to the youth they're supposed to be helping. The film's central arch is a love triangle gone terribly wrong. Dominick(Asher Brauner), leader of the Silver Daggers, and Lace(Robbie Lee), leader of the Debs, are an item. Enter Maggie(Joanne Nail), new to their side of the city who gets in an altercation with the Dagger Debs' Patch(Monica Gayle), showing her courage and strength, twirling a mean chain which trips her foes before assaulting them further. Dominick is drawn to Maggie, it's a type of lust Patch recognizes, and capitalizes on when she notices this newcomer moving in on her best friend, Lace. Lace is completely obsessed with Dominick, although she's just a piece of ass to him. When Dominick infuriates Lace after blowing up into a tirade towards her about the revelation of carrying his child, she gets even by informing Crabs of a strategic attack on them at a neutral site, a roller rink, resulting in a bloody shootout which takes out innocent bystanders, among other cataclysmic results. With the Silver Daggers deeply wounded, the Debs must assume control, with Maggie more than willing to take the leadership position after Crabs kicked Lace in the stomach causing a miscarriage. Aligning herself with a bad ass group of sistas who follow the political teachings of Mao, led by Muff(Marlene Clark), the newly named Jezebels prepare to conquer Crabs, crushing his regime, disintegrating his stranglehold on the a specific part of the city. But, what Maggie doesn't realize is that Patch and Lace are planning to murder her, getting rid of the one responsible for taking Dominick away from her. Maggie wants to uncover the culprit behind informing Crabs of the proposed strike at the roller rink, not knowing that it was actually Lace. As expected, the two girls will have to duke it out for supremacy of the Jezebels. With lots of quotable dialogue and campy performances, it's hard to resist such a film as Switchblade Sisters, certainly when you realize that the premise concerns a white girl gang who can actually cause fear in citizens. Switchblade Sisters kind of reminds me of those 50's juvy films confronting the gang mentality and how it's controlling the school system and streets, breeding crime that's swallowing the youth, turning them into unlawful monsters. Transplant such a genre to the 70's, add extra seediness, vulgarity, violence, and current themes of that time that were prevalent(..there was a sentiment of anger towards the police and capitalist society)and it's easy to see why this would appeal to a cult audience. And, as Jack Hill always did, inject a cast of babes in the roles of the protagonists. You gotta love the scene where Maggie knocks Don Stark(..Dagger member, Hook, often slapping girls around)for a loop or Lace's psychopathia and mad ravings. Oh, and Patch..now this is a character that belongs in a Jack Hill gang film. Switchblade Sisters is directed in such a way that you can't take it the least bit seriously, and if you accept it on it's own terms, I can't imagine an exploitation fan not enjoying it. Robbie Lee isn't contained and lets it rip, playing her role as the confrontational Lace to the hilt, with Nail, in her short shorts, delivering her lines with gusto, staring her opposition right in the eyes, unflinchingly, ready for a fight. Nail might be considered unacceptable in such a role in any other film, but Jack Hill made it work. Gayle is my gal, though, as Patch, a ferocious back-stabbing bitch who persuades Lace to commit unspeakable acts that cause major repercussions which change the landscape of their lives, disrupting a harmony her gang had before Maggie came along. The juvenile prison scene, albeit brief, was a hoot as the girls lead a full on assault on the female guards who were on the verge of accosting Maggie. The way the faculty are muzzled by the Daggers and Debs, completely overwhelmed psychologically, afraid to voice their concerns about the dissension of their students, is rather hilarious. You actually get two great closing fights, the Jezebels and Muff's girls besieging Crab's soldiers, and the knife battle between Maggie and Lace. The scene where Maggie, with a bloody face, warns the coppers that when they return, there'll be hell to pay, is priceless.

    In the 70s, when women's lib became as much a part of civil rights as race issues, many films portrayed women as being just as vicious as men. I think that this factor often resulted from male studio heads and producers, who were threatened by women's increasing demands for equality in society. As a result, many films with female characters, were portrayed as being even more dangerous than the most violent of males. The Jezebels is a film, that's a perfect example of this 'woman as more deadly than the male' mentality. The film revolves around a group of teen girls, who form a gang called the Jezebels. They all come from dysfunctional families, and live in a crumbling, tenement apartment building. The girls dress in funky, rough-looking leather jackets and torn jeans. They all carry switch-blade knives, and know how to use them. Their boyfriends have their own gang, and they all hang together with the Jezebels, in an abandoned warehouse. These tough kids are all in constant, bloody battles with rival gangs, the police, and even each other. When a drug kingpin threatens their survival, the huge battle that results, severely tests the loyalties of the Jezebels to each other, and to their boyfriends. There's no shortage of car chases, shootings, knifings, and general all-around mayhem in this movie. All of this overwhelms the film, and gives it a tacky, melodramatic quality. The performances of virtually all the actors, are fraught with hammy overacting. It's only a mildly entertaining movie, at best.

    The Dagger Debs are a gang of snarling girls, and Maggie (Joanne Nail) is their newest member. Lace (Robbie Lee), the ever tooth-gritting leader, befriends her but soon has doubts -- it seems Lace's man Dominic (Asher Brauner), head of the Silver Daggers, fancies the new recruit. Director Jack Hill, one of my idols and a swell guy, has had some strange things to say about this film. He has said the script was inspired by "Othello", and has also claimed to interview real female gang members before making the movie. And yet, he readily admits the whole thing is a "wacky fantasy"... The film not only has jail, gang fights and more... it has a pregnancy subplot! How do you beat that? While this may be no social commentary, it really does its best to be an exploitation classic (and it comes as no surprise that Quentin Tarantino has been the biggest supporter of this film.)

    Switchblade Sisters (1975) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Trashy cult classic from Jack Hill has new girl Maggie (Joanne Nail) joining up with a female gang being ran by Lace (Robbie Lee) but soon everyone's loyalty is tested when a rival gang causes trouble. If you're looking for a thought-provoking, deep and serious look at females in trouble then it's best you go check out some talky foreign film. If you want sleaze, nudity, violence, cat fights and that sort of thing then Jack Hill's film is just what you're looking for. It's easy to watch this film and realize why it has become a cult favorite over the years because there are just so many classic scenes within the genre. While the film isn't perfect and there are certainly some weak moments, there's still no question that the film contains some of the best scenes from this type of exploitation picture. One such scene happens rather early on when the girls are sentenced to a jail and they come under attack from a large woman who is the boss. What happens during the two attack scenes are just priceless and will have the viewer rolling. Another terrific scene happens towards the middle when there's a violent gun battle at a roller rink. Purely priceless this scene is. The performances aren't what we'd consider "good" but I think everyone fits their roles just fine. This is especially true of Nail and Lee. It's also fun seeing Lenny Bruce's daughter Kitty in the cast as Donut. Hill keeps the film moving at a very good pace and there's all sorts of fun to be had throughout. SWITCHBLADE SISTERS deserves its cult reputation without question.

    SWITCHBLADE SISTERS/THE JEZEBELS- 1976. My friend, Bob, made a connection with the Extras Casting Director at New World Entertainment, in Hollywood, California. I was interviewed and assigned a role as a "cop". My wife was assigned a role as a "street person". We would each earn $20 a day, plus catered meals. Early one morning, we assembled at a defunct Tasty-Freeze Drive-in restaurant in Eagle Rock, CA. I was given a "Metropolitan Police Uniform", a "flack jacket", a helmet and a "Billy Club". My first duty was to drive a "Police Car" full of other "Officers" to the curb in front of the Drive-in. We disembarked and chased after the "Dagger Debs", who had scattered upon our arrival. I located one of the Debs behind a dumpster in the rear of the property. I grabbed her wrist and put a (gentle) Hammerlock on her arm. With my club raised to strike, I marched her towards the camera. Suddenly she snarled, "Let go, you Son-of-a Bitch". Forgetting that she was an actress, I thought I was hurting her, so I released the hold. The Director yelled, "Cut". And that scene went onto the Cutting Room floor! Then, my friend Bob was instructed to frisk another Deb for weapons. Being a very religious, family man, he kept his hands about five inches away from her body. The Director finally yelled for him to," feel her up". He blushed as he complied! My wife (in a blue dress) and two other "street persons" sat at tables in front of the Drive-in when the Debs showed up. The ladies "fled" and the scene was completed. On a subsequent evening, we assembled at a vacant pottery factory in Glendale, CA. This was the clubhouse of the Debs. Following their well-orchestrated Knife Fight, we cops burst into the building. I grabbed one of the girls by her ponytail and pulled her head against the end of a shotgun. (That was cut). Finally, I got a full-face scene as I loaded the girls into the police van. As we rehearsed, I would grab and roughly shove them into the vehicle. But, then I would gently help them down for the next practice. You may notice that my "flack vest" is worn wrong side out. It was very late when I got home, so I got ready for bed in the dark. Only in the morning, did my wife see that my arms were covered with blood (fake)! My wife & I had only observed the filming of our respective scenes, so we looked forward to the movie's release at a theater. We took our 14 year-old son to see it on screen. Holy Smokes! The language, the suggestive body actions  we were so embarrassed! But our son said it was just like Junior Hi-school!

    Jack Hill also did Coffy & did a good job about updating The 1963-era "Birmingham Angel" to Pam Grier. I wonder if Pam Grier remembered, "Birmingham Sunday"? The Jezebels got some reinforcement from a black girl group that followed Mao. However In life I've seen a black girl with a 1955 Packard Clipper beat up a bully in real life back in 1963. The urban assault car came from a 1955 Packard Patrician 4-Dr. Sedan so Jack Hill & I met halfway. Kitty Bruce's Donut was a thankless character, but she was loyal to the end. The Movie was unreal in some parts, but people actually think they can get away with it but in reality check, you get it in the end. If I did the screen writing, The black girl gang led by Muff would be shown as spirits & have 1950s cars with lethal death rays installed in them and poisoned black smoke & the led car would be a 1955 Packard Clipper Sedan & when the black girl gang leave the scene a mist is used and they go into the mist and vanish. And when they unleash there weapons on Crabs' Teen Patrol they would yell: "We didn't forget what happened on Birmingham Sunday, on September 15, 1963 & this one is for Denise McNair & her fellow school girls!" and they would zap The Teen Patrol with death rays & vaporized them & get most of the members. However Crabs gets it by Lace. The movie was good and Jack Hill met me halfway with the urban assault vehicle made from a 1955 Packard & didn't name the leader, "Esther Williams". I liked the movie & it's in my collection. With a girl gang like The Jezebels, they make Charles Starkweather look like Pope John Paul II. That's it for now. Marcus Brainard

    Whoever said Quentin Tarantino doesn't know Exploitation? Well, I guess I did, I mean, really, what exactly was Death Proof (and Planet Terror) supposed to prove? So, Tarantino obviously doesn't know much about recreating B-movies, but the man certainly knows a quality B-movie when he sees it. Quentin Tarantino dug Jack Hill's gritty, mean-spirited, ofter humorous, gangsploitation epic so much that he made it apart of his Rolling Thunder label, and who can blame him? Switchblade Sisters is quality B-entertainment from beginning to end. I could tell I would love this movie as soon a the theme song started. Tough, trashy chicks rock, especially in the 70's. These streets are ran by a male gang, The Silver Daggers, ran by Dominic, and a female gang, the dagger debs, ran by Lace, Dominic's chipmunk-voiced girlfriend. Seemingly a happy couple at first, but after Maggie, the vicious new member of Lace's gang, threatens their relationship, Lace is so wrapped up in vengeance, that she can't even see that her position as leader might also be in question. For any guys out there in the need for something to watch with your feminist girlfriend, look no further, because Switchblade Sisters offers plenty of eye-candy as well as a a strong sense of equality for the ladies. So, any genius's out there thinking of showing the girlfriend I Spit On Your Grave, it won't be necessary. Switchblade Sisters isn't nearly as inept as most Exploitation movies, and it's cool and all that Tarantino released it, but we need a badass release from a real B-movie label, like Something Weird Video, or even Troma. But then again, at least it's out there. Any fans of sleazy Exploitation, sleazy humor, and sleazy women, should find this movie to be nothing short of delightful. Yay for Switchblade Sisters!! 8/10

    The Dagger Debs, tough-talking high school broads with switchblade knives, benevolent snarls, attitude to spare, and propensity for violence, striking fear in the hearts of the citizens on the streets, are on equal footing with a the male Silver Daggers, a bossy, nasty brood whose harsh bullying ways leave the community they frequent cuckolded in a state of quivering angst. Soon a rival gang must attend the Daggers' school due to theirs closing, and a struggle for dominance ensues. Each gang has their own turf, which the other doesn't dare cross into. Crabs, quite old to be still in high school, has a much larger gang than his mortal enemy, Dominick, and runs high enterprise in dope-dealing through the facade of a community organizing group schmoozing with the mayor while selling drugs to the youth they're supposed to be helping. The film's central arch is a love triangle gone terribly wrong. Dominick(Asher Brauner), leader of the Silver Daggers, and Lace(Robbie Lee), leader of the Debs, are an item. Enter Maggie(Joanne Nail), new to their side of the city who gets in an altercation with the Dagger Debs' Patch(Monica Gayle), showing her courage and strength, twirling a mean chain which trips her foes before assaulting them further. Dominick is drawn to Maggie, it's a type of lust Patch recognizes, and capitalizes on when she notices this newcomer moving in on her best friend, Lace. Lace is completely obsessed with Dominick, although she's just a piece of ass to him. When Dominick infuriates Lace after blowing up into a tirade towards her about the revelation of carrying his child, she gets even by informing Crabs of a strategic attack on them at a neutral site, a roller rink, resulting in a bloody shootout which takes out innocent bystanders, among other cataclysmic results. With the Silver Daggers deeply wounded, the Debs must assume control, with Maggie more than willing to take the leadership position after Crabs kicked Lace in the stomach causing a miscarriage. Aligning herself with a bad ass group of sistas who follow the political teachings of Mao, led by Muff(Marlene Clark), the newly named Jezebels prepare to conquer Crabs, crushing his regime, disintegrating his stranglehold on the a specific part of the city. But, what Maggie doesn't realize is that Patch and Lace are planning to murder her, getting rid of the one responsible for taking Dominick away from her. Maggie wants to uncover the culprit behind informing Crabs of the proposed strike at the roller rink, not knowing that it was actually Lace. As expected, the two girls will have to duke it out for supremacy of the Jezebels. With lots of quotable dialogue and campy performances, it's hard to resist such a film as Switchblade Sisters, certainly when you realize that the premise concerns a white girl gang who can actually cause fear in citizens. Switchblade Sisters kind of reminds me of those 50's juvy films confronting the gang mentality and how it's controlling the school system and streets, breeding crime that's swallowing the youth, turning them into unlawful monsters. Transplant such a genre to the 70's, add extra seediness, vulgarity, violence, and current themes of that time that were prevalent(..there was a sentiment of anger towards the police and capitalist society)and it's easy to see why this would appeal to a cult audience. And, as Jack Hill always did, inject a cast of babes in the roles of the protagonists. You gotta love the scene where Maggie knocks Don Stark(..Dagger member, Hook, often slapping girls around)for a loop or Lace's psychopathia and mad ravings. Oh, and Patch..now this is a character that belongs in a Jack Hill gang film. Switchblade Sisters is directed in such a way that you can't take it the least bit seriously, and if you accept it on it's own terms, I can't imagine an exploitation fan not enjoying it. Robbie Lee isn't contained and lets it rip, playing her role as the confrontational Lace to the hilt, with Nail, in her short shorts, delivering her lines with gusto, staring her opposition right in the eyes, unflinchingly, ready for a fight. Nail might be considered unacceptable in such a role in any other film, but Jack Hill made it work. Gayle is my gal, though, as Patch, a ferocious back-stabbing bitch who persuades Lace to commit unspeakable acts that cause major repercussions which change the landscape of their lives, disrupting a harmony her gang had before Maggie came along. The juvenile prison scene, albeit brief, was a hoot as the girls lead a full on assault on the female guards who were on the verge of accosting Maggie. The way the faculty are muzzled by the Daggers and Debs, completely overwhelmed psychologically, afraid to voice their concerns about the dissension of their students, is rather hilarious. You actually get two great closing fights, the Jezebels and Muff's girls besieging Crab's soldiers, and the knife battle between Maggie and Lace. The scene where Maggie, with a bloody face, warns the coppers that when they return, there'll be hell to pay, is priceless.

    In the 70s, when women's lib became as much a part of civil rights as race issues, many films portrayed women as being just as vicious as men. I think that this factor often resulted from male studio heads and producers, who were threatened by women's increasing demands for equality in society. As a result, many films with female characters, were portrayed as being even more dangerous than the most violent of males. The Jezebels is a film, that's a perfect example of this 'woman as more deadly than the male' mentality. The film revolves around a group of teen girls, who form a gang called the Jezebels. They all come from dysfunctional families, and live in a crumbling, tenement apartment building. The girls dress in funky, rough-looking leather jackets and torn jeans. They all carry switch-blade knives, and know how to use them. Their boyfriends have their own gang, and they all hang together with the Jezebels, in an abandoned warehouse. These tough kids are all in constant, bloody battles with rival gangs, the police, and even each other. When a drug kingpin threatens their survival, the huge battle that results, severely tests the loyalties of the Jezebels to each other, and to their boyfriends. There's no shortage of car chases, shootings, knifings, and general all-around mayhem in this movie. All of this overwhelms the film, and gives it a tacky, melodramatic quality. The performances of virtually all the actors, are fraught with hammy overacting. It's only a mildly entertaining movie, at best.

    The inner-city, prone to violence, crime, drugs, even sex. The top gang that rules the area are the Silver Daggers. With them are their female counterparts, the Dagger Debs lead by Lace (Robbie Lee). One day, they meet a loner name Maggie (Joanne Nail), who holds her own. After a night in juvenile hall, Maggie joins the ranks and gains the trust of Lace. However, Lace's friend Patch is suspicious of Maggie. As Maggie began to to know the ways of the Dagger Debs, she makes a move on Lace's boyfriend Dominic (Asher Brauner), who would not take the role of a father when he hears about Lace's pregnancy. More to it, Maggie would take in the reins of leading the Dagger Debs following a failed ambush at a roller rink. The men are ousted by Maggie, and they go form the Dagger Debs, to the Jezebels. They even join a militant gang to help boost the power of the group. When Lace re cooperates from her attack, she joins the group, only to suspect Maggie as a traitor. I like the scene where Lace beats up Maggie, and tortures her by sticking a cigarette butt in her bellybutton. Then came the showdown. Classic scene. The gang gains a new leader, while Patch is left behind. Goes to show there is no loyalty among gangs. Power shifts, and questionable leadership can destroy an organization. The Jezebels have not only ousted the men, but Lace as well, without her knowledge. They consider her a weak link in the gang. 4 out of 5 stars.

    Predating the cycle of gang movies by a few years, "The Jezebels" (a.k.a. "Switchblade Sisters") by exploitation icon Jack Hill really is a whole lot of fun. It's colourful entertainment that actually manages to be campy and serious in equal doses. And it does come complete with a feminist statement. Robbie Lee is Lace, the leader of a girl gang dubbed The Dagger Debs, who are affiliated with a male gang known as the Silver Daggers. She's sweet on Dominic (Asher Brauner), their leader. Laces' world starts falling apart when Maggie (Joanne Nail), a loner, attracts the attention of the gangs (especially Dominic) and rises within the ranks - and gains influence - a little too quickly. Amid the personal problems of the main characters, they must go to war with a gang that masquerades as community activists. Considering the fact that some of these actresses don't really convince at all as tough gals (especially Lee), and are clearly too old for their roles, they really are a whole lot of fun. Monica Gayle delivers a standout performance as Patch, a gang member who comes to distrust and despise Maggie. A rich assortment of familiar actors in the supporting roles include Marlene Clark as black revolutionary Muff, Don Stark as Hook, Bill Adler as Fingers, Kate Murtagh as butch lesbian prison guard Mom Smackley, and Bob Minor as police officer Parker. Nail definitely looks very hot in various sexy outfits. Co-star Kitty Bruce, who plays the put-upon Donut, is the daughter of Lenny Bruce. The movie contains some absolute gems of dialogue thanks to screenwriter F.X. Maier; the viewer will find them very quotable. Nails' speech to the cops right before the end credits is hilarious. There's sex and plenty of violence, and some eye catching costumes by Jodie Tillen. And you just know that this is going to a be a most enjoyable film because of the tune "Black Hearted Woman" that's belted out during the opening credits. Many fine scenes include the clich&eacute;d action in the penitentiary and the gunfights at the roller rink and in the streets. Fans of this kind of thing would be well advised to seek it out. It really hits the spot in terms of all of its exploitative elements. Nine out of 10.

    "The Jezebels" is also known as "Switchblade Sisters". And, whatever you call it, it's complete crap. Now this is NOT meant as criticism. It's obvious the folks making this wanted to make a trashy movie and boy did they make a nasty, crappy picture!! It's violent, stupid and even promotes the old rape myth! So, it certainly is not a film to show your mother or Father Jenkins. The film begins with a gang of female punks attacking Maggie in a restaurant. Next thing you know, the ladies are in jail and the leader and intended victim become best friends! Soon, when they are all out of stir, the gang welcomes the newest recruit, Maggie, by raping her. Nice folks, huh? But the victim isn't particularly put out by this and soon she helps them in a gang war. And, before you know it, Maggie is their leader and makes friends with a local lady Black Panthers group and the war is on! But there is a traitor within the gang and Maggie's reign might be coming to a swift end. And, when the film ends, it sure looks as if there will be a sequel--which there wasn't. There really isn't a lot of good in the film. It's super-violent and sadistic and unrepentantly nasty. And, because of that, the film is, in a sick way, quite entertaining---sort of a guilty pleasure if you are a bad movie buff.

    The Dagger Debs are a gang of snarling girls, and Maggie (Joanne Nail) is their newest member. Lace (Robbie Lee), the ever tooth-gritting leader, befriends her but soon has doubts -- it seems Lace's man Dominic (Asher Brauner), head of the Silver Daggers, fancies the new recruit. Director Jack Hill, one of my idols and a swell guy, has had some strange things to say about this film. He has said the script was inspired by "Othello", and has also claimed to interview real female gang members before making the movie. And yet, he readily admits the whole thing is a "wacky fantasy"... The film not only has jail, gang fights and more... it has a pregnancy subplot! How do you beat that?

    SWITCHBLADE SISTERS/THE JEZEBELS- 1976. My friend, Bob, made a connection with the Extras Casting Director at New World Entertainment, in Hollywood, California. I was interviewed and assigned a role as a "cop". My wife was assigned a role as a "street person". We would each earn $20 a day, plus catered meals. Early one morning, we assembled at a defunct Tasty-Freeze Drive-in restaurant in Eagle Rock, CA. I was given a "Metropolitan Police Uniform", a "flack jacket", a helmet and a "Billy Club".

Suddenly she snarled, "Let go, you Son-of-a Bitch". Forgetting that she was an actress, I thought I was hurting her, so I released the hold. The Director yelled, "Cut". And that scene went onto the Cutting Room floor! Then, my friend Bob was instructed to frisk another Deb for weapons. Being a very religious, family man, he kept his hands about five inches away from her body. The Director finally yelled for him to," feel her up". He blushed as he complied! My wife (in a blue dress) and two other "street persons" sat at tables in front of the Drive-in when the Debs showed up. The ladies "fled" and the scene was completed. On a subsequent evening, we assembled at a vacant pottery factory in Glendale, CA. This was the clubhouse of the Debs. Following their well-orchestrated Knife Fight, we cops burst into the building. I grabbed one of the girls by her ponytail and pulled her head against the end of a shotgun. (That was cut). Finally, I got a full-face scene as I loaded the girls into the police van. As we rehearsed, I would grab and roughly shove them into the vehicle. But, then I would gently help them down for the next practice. You may notice that my "flack vest" is worn wrong side out. It was very late when I got home, so I got ready for bed in the dark. Only in the morning, did my wife see that my arms were covered with blood (fake)! My wife & I had only observed the filming of our respective scenes, so we looked forward to the movie's release at a theater. We took our 14 year-old son to see it on screen. Holy Smokes!

For any guys out there in the need for something to watch with your feminist girlfriend, look no further, because Switchblade Sisters offers plenty of eye-candy as well as a a strong sense of equality for the ladies. So, any genius's out there thinking of showing the girlfriend I Spit On Your Grave, it won't be necessary. Switchblade Sisters isn't nearly as inept as most Exploitation movies, and it's cool and all that Tarantino released it, but we need a badass release from a real B-movie label, like Something Weird Video, or even Troma. But then again, at least it's out there. Any fans of sleazy Exploitation, sleazy humor, and sleazy women, should find this movie to be nothing short of delightful. Yay for Switchblade Sisters!! 8/10

    The Dagger Debs, tough-talking high school broads with switchblade knives, benevolent snarls, attitude to spare, and propensity for violence, striking fear in the hearts of the citizens on the streets, are on equal footing with a the male Silver Daggers, a bossy, nasty brood whose harsh bullying ways leave the community they frequent cuckolded in a state of quivering angst. Soon a rival gang must attend the Daggers' school due to theirs closing, and a struggle for dominance ensues. Each gang has their own turf, which the other doesn't dare cross into. Crabs, quite old to be still in high school, has a much larger gang than his mortal enemy, Dominick, and runs high enterprise in dope-dealing through the facade of a community organizing group schmoozing with the mayor while selling drugs to the youth they're supposed to be helping. The film's central arch is a love triangle gone terribly wrong. Dominick(Asher Brauner), leader of the Silver Daggers, and Lace(Robbie Lee), leader of the Debs, are an item. Enter Maggie(Joanne Nail), new to their side of the city who gets in an altercation with the Dagger Debs' Patch(Monica Gayle), showing her courage and strength, twirling a mean chain which trips her foes before assaulting them further. Dominick is drawn to Maggie, it's a type of lust Patch recognizes, and capitalizes on when she notices this newcomer moving in on her best friend, Lace. Lace is completely obsessed with Dominick, although she's just a piece of ass to him. When Dominick infuriates Lace after blowing up into a tirade towards her about the revelation of carrying his child, she gets even by informing Crabs of a strategic attack on them at a neutral site, a roller rink, resulting in a bloody shootout which takes out innocent bystanders, among other cataclysmic results. With the Silver Daggers deeply wounded, the Debs must assume control, with Maggie more than willing to take the leadership position after Crabs kicked Lace in the stomach causing a miscarriage. Aligning herself with a bad ass group of sistas who follow the political teachings of Mao, led by Muff(Marlene Clark), the newly named Jezebels prepare to conquer Crabs, crushing his regime, disintegrating his stranglehold on the a specific part of the city. But, what Maggie doesn't realize is that Patch and Lace are planning to murder her, getting rid of the one responsible for taking Dominick away from her. Maggie wants to uncover the culprit behind informing Crabs of the proposed strike at the roller rink, not knowing that it was actually Lace. As expected, the two girls will have to duke it out for supremacy of the Jezebels. With lots of quotable dialogue and campy performances, it's hard to resist such a film as Switchblade Sisters, certainly when you realize that the premise concerns a white girl gang who can actually cause fear in citizens. Switchblade Sisters kind of reminds me of those 50's juvy films confronting the gang mentality and how it's controlling the school system and streets, breeding crime that's swallowing the youth, turning them into unlawful monsters. Transplant such a genre to the 70's, add extra seediness, vulgarity, violence, and current themes of that time that were prevalent(..there was a sentiment of anger towards the police and capitalist society)and it's easy to see why this would appeal to a cult audience. And, as Jack Hill always did, inject a cast of babes in the roles of the protagonists. You gotta love the scene where Maggie knocks Don Stark(..Dagger member, Hook, often slapping girls around)for a loop or Lace's psychopathia and mad ravings. Oh, and Patch..now this is a character that belongs in a Jack Hill gang film. Switchblade Sisters is directed in such a way that you can't take it the least bit seriously, and if you accept it on it's own terms, I can't imagine an exploitation fan not enjoying it. Robbie Lee isn't contained and lets it rip, playing her role as the confrontational Lace to the hilt, with Nail, in her short shorts, delivering her lines with gusto, staring her opposition right in the eyes, unflinchingly, ready for a fight. Nail might be considered unacceptable in such a role in any other film, but Jack Hill made it work. Gayle is my gal, though, as Patch, a ferocious back-stabbing bitch who persuades Lace to commit unspeakable acts that cause major repercussions which change the landscape of their lives, disrupting a harmony her gang had before Maggie came along. The juvenile prison scene, albeit brief, was a hoot as the girls lead a full on assault on the female guards who were on the verge of accosting Maggie. The way the faculty are muzzled by the Daggers and Debs, completely overwhelmed psychologically, afraid to voice their concerns about the dissension of their students, is rather hilarious. You actually get two great closing fights, the Jezebels and Muff's girls besieging Crab's soldiers, and the knife battle between Maggie and Lace. The scene where Maggie, with a bloody face, warns the coppers that when they return, there'll be hell to pay, is priceless.

    In the 70s, when women's lib became as much a part of civil rights as race issues, many films portrayed women as being just as vicious as men. I think that this factor often resulted from male studio heads and producers, who were threatened by women's increasing demands for equality in society. As a result, many films with female characters, were portrayed as being even more dangerous than the most violent of males. The Jezebels is a film, that's a perfect example of this 'woman as more deadly than the male' mentality. The film revolves around a group of teen girls, who form a gang called the Jezebels. They all come from dysfunctional families, and live in a crumbling, tenement apartment building. The girls dress in funky, rough-looking leather jackets and torn jeans. They all carry switch-blade knives, and know how to use them. Their boyfriends have their own gang, and they all hang together with the Jezebels, in an abandoned warehouse. These tough kids are all in constant, bloody battles with rival gangs, the police, and even each other. When a drug kingpin threatens their survival, the huge battle that results, severely tests the loyalties of the Jezebels to each other, and to their boyfriends. There's no shortage of car chases, shootings, knifings, and general all-around mayhem in this movie. All of this overwhelms the film, and gives it a tacky, melodramatic quality. The performances of virtually all the actors, are fraught with hammy overacting. It's only a mildly entertaining movie, at best.

    The inner-city, prone to violence, crime, drugs, even sex. The top gang that rules the area are the Silver Daggers. With them are their female counterparts, the Dagger Debs lead by Lace (Robbie Lee). One day, they meet a loner name Maggie (Joanne Nail), who holds her own. After a night in juvenile hall, Maggie joins the ranks and gains the trust of Lace. However, Lace's friend Patch is suspicious of Maggie. As Maggie began to to know the ways of the Dagger Debs, she makes a move on Lace's boyfriend Dominic (Asher Brauner), who would not take the role of a father when he hears about Lace's pregnancy. More to it, Maggie would take in the reins of leading the Dagger Debs following a failed ambush at a roller rink. The men are ousted by Maggie, and they go form the Dagger Debs, to the Jezebels. They even join a militant gang to help boost the power of the group. When Lace re cooperates from her attack, she joins the group, only to suspect Maggie as a traitor. I like the scene where Lace beats up Maggie, and tortures her by sticking a cigarette butt in her bellybutton. Then came the showdown. Classic scene. The gang gains a new leader, while Patch is left behind. Goes to show there is no loyalty among gangs. Power shifts, and questionable leadership can destroy an organization. The Jezebels have not only ousted the men, but Lace as well, without her knowledge. They consider her a weak link in the gang. 4 out of 5 stars.

    Predating the cycle of gang movies by a few years, "The Jezebels" (a.k.a. "Switchblade Sisters") by exploitation icon Jack Hill really is a whole lot of fun. It's colourful entertainment that actually manages to be campy and serious in equal doses. And it does come complete with a feminist statement. Robbie Lee is Lace, the leader of a girl gang dubbed The Dagger Debs, who are affiliated with a male gang known as the Silver Daggers. She's sweet on Dominic (Asher Brauner), their leader. Laces' world starts falling apart when Maggie (Joanne Nail), a loner, attracts the attention of the gangs (especially Dominic) and rises within the ranks - and gains influence - a little too quickly. Amid the personal problems of the main characters, they must go to war with a gang that masquerades as community activists. Considering the fact that some of these actresses don't really convince at all as tough gals (especially Lee), and are clearly too old for their roles, they really are a whole lot of fun. Monica Gayle delivers a standout performance as Patch, a gang member who comes to distrust and despise Maggie. A rich assortment of familiar actors in the supporting roles include Marlene Clark as black revolutionary Muff, Don Stark as Hook, Bill Adler as Fingers, Kate Murtagh as butch lesbian prison guard Mom Smackley, and Bob Minor as police officer Parker. Nail definitely looks very hot in various sexy outfits. Co-star Kitty Bruce, who plays the put-upon Donut, is the daughter of Lenny Bruce. The movie contains some absolute gems of dialogue thanks to screenwriter F.X. Maier; the viewer will find them very quotable. Nails' speech to the cops right before the end credits is hilarious. There's sex and plenty of violence, and some eye catching costumes by Jodie Tillen. And you just know that this is going to a be a most enjoyable film because of the tune "Black Hearted Woman" that's belted out during the opening credits. Many fine scenes include the clich&eacute;d action in the penitentiary and the gunfights at the roller rink and in the streets. Fans of this kind of thing would be well advised to seek it out. It really hits the spot in terms of all of its exploitative elements. Nine out of 10.

    "The Jezebels" is also known as "Switchblade Sisters". And, whatever you call it, it's complete crap. Now this is NOT meant as criticism. It's obvious the folks making this wanted to make a trashy movie and boy did they make a nasty, crappy picture!! It's violent, stupid and even promotes the old rape myth! So, it certainly is not a film to show your mother or Father Jenkins. The film begins with a gang of female punks attacking Maggie in a restaurant. Next thing you know, the ladies are in jail and the leader and intended victim become best friends! Soon, when they are all out of stir, the gang welcomes the newest recruit, Maggie, by raping her. Nice folks, huh? But the victim isn't particularly put out by this and soon she helps them in a gang war. And, before you know it, Maggie is their leader and makes friends with a local lady Black Panthers group and the war is on! But there is a traitor within the gang and Maggie's reign might be coming to a swift end. And, when the film ends, it sure looks as if there will be a sequel--which there wasn't. There really isn't a lot of good in the film. It's super-violent and sadistic and unrepentantly nasty. And, because of that, the film is, in a sick way, quite entertaining---sort of a guilty pleasure if you are a bad movie buff.

    The Dagger Debs are a gang of snarling girls, and Maggie (Joanne Nail) is their newest member. Lace (Robbie Lee), the ever tooth-gritting leader, befriends her but soon has doubts -- it seems Lace's man Dominic (Asher Brauner), head of the Silver Daggers, fancies the new recruit. Director Jack Hill, one of my idols and a swell guy, has had some strange things to say about this film. He has said the script was inspired by "Othello", and has also claimed to interview real female gang members before making the movie. And yet, he readily admits the whole thing is a "wacky fantasy"... The film not only has jail, gang fights and more... it has a pregnancy subplot! How do you beat that? While this may be no social commentary, it really does its best to be an exploitation classic (and it comes as no surprise that Quentin Tarantino has been the biggest supporter of this film.)

    Switchblade Sisters (1975) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Trashy cult classic from Jack Hill has new girl Maggie (Joanne Nail) joining up with a female gang being ran by Lace (Robbie Lee) but soon everyone's loyalty is tested when a rival gang causes trouble. If you're looking for a thought-provoking, deep and serious look at females in trouble then it's best you go check out some talky foreign film. If you want sleaze, nudity, violence, cat fights and that sort of thing then Jack Hill's film is just what you're looking for. It's easy to watch this film and realize why it has become a cult favorite over the years because there are just so many classic scenes within the genre. While the film isn't perfect and there are certainly some weak moments, there's still no question that the film contains some of the best scenes from this type of exploitation picture. One such scene happens rather early on when the girls are sentenced to a jail and they come under attack from a large woman who is the boss. What happens during the two attack scenes are just priceless and will have the viewer rolling. Another terrific scene happens towards the middle when there's a violent gun battle at a roller rink. Purely priceless this scene is. The performances aren't what we'd consider "good" but I think everyone fits their roles just fine. This is especially true of Nail and Lee. It's also fun seeing Lenny Bruce's daughter Kitty in the cast as Donut. Hill keeps the film moving at a very good pace and there's all sorts of fun to be had throughout. SWITCHBLADE SISTERS deserves its cult reputation without question.

    SWITCHBLADE SISTERS/THE JEZEBELS- 1976. My friend, Bob, made a connection with the Extras Casting Director at New World Entertainment, in Hollywood, California. I was interviewed and assigned a role as a "cop". My wife was assigned a role as a "street person". We would each earn $20 a day, plus catered meals. Early one morning, we assembled at a defunct Tasty-Freeze Drive-in restaurant in Eagle Rock, CA. I was given a "Metropolitan Police Uniform", a "flack jacket", a helmet and a "Billy Club". My first duty was to drive a "Police Car" full of other "Officers" to the curb in front of the Drive-in. We disembarked and chased after the "Dagger Debs", who had scattered upon our arrival. I located one of the Debs behind a dumpster in the rear of the property. I grabbed her wrist and put a (gentle) Hammerlock on her arm. With my club raised to strike, I marched her towards the camera. Suddenly she snarled, "Let go, you Son-of-a Bitch". Forgetting that she was an actress, I thought I was hurting her, so I released the hold. The Director yelled, "Cut". And that scene went onto the Cutting Room floor! Then, my friend Bob was instructed to frisk another Deb for weapons. Being a very religious, family man, he kept his hands about five inches away from her body. The Director finally yelled for him to," feel her up". He blushed as he complied! My wife (in a blue dress) and two other "street persons" sat at tables in front of the Drive-in when the Debs showed up. The ladies "fled" and the scene was completed. On a subsequent evening, we assembled at a vacant pottery factory in Glendale, CA. This was the clubhouse of the Debs. Following their well-orchestrated Knife Fight, we cops burst into the building. I grabbed one of the girls by her ponytail and pulled her head against the end of a shotgun. (That was cut). Finally, I got a full-face scene as I loaded the girls into the police van. As we rehearsed, I would grab and roughly shove them into the vehicle. But, then I would gently help them down for the next practice. You may notice that my "flack vest" is worn wrong side out. It was very late when I got home, so I got ready for bed in the dark. Only in the morning, did my wife see that my arms were covered with blood (fake)! My wife & I had only observed the filming of our respective scenes, so we looked forward to the movie's release at a theater. We took our 14 year-old son to see it on screen. Holy Smokes! The language, the suggestive body actions  we were so embarrassed! But our son said it was just like Junior Hi-school!

    Jack Hill also did Coffy & did a good job about updating The 1963-era "Birmingham Angel" to Pam Grier. I wonder if Pam Grier remembered, "Birmingham Sunday"? The Jezebels got some reinforcement from a black girl group that followed Mao. However In life I've seen a black girl with a 1955 Packard Clipper beat up a bully in real life back in 1963. The urban assault car came from a 1955 Packard Patrician 4-Dr. Sedan so Jack Hill & I met halfway. Kitty Bruce's Donut was a thankless character, but she was loyal to the end. The Movie was unreal in some parts, but people actually think they can get away with it but in reality check, you get it in the end. If I did the screen writing, The black girl gang led by Muff would be shown as spirits & have 1950s cars with lethal death rays installed in them and poisoned black smoke & the led car would be a 1955 Packard Clipper Sedan & when the black girl gang leave the scene a mist is used and they go into the mist and vanish. And when they unleash there weapons on Crabs' Teen Patrol they would yell: "We didn't forget what happened on Birmingham Sunday, on September 15, 1963 & this one is for Denise McNair & her fellow school girls!" and they would zap The Teen Patrol with death rays & vaporized them & get most of the members. However Crabs gets it by Lace. The movie was good and Jack Hill met me halfway with the urban assault vehicle made from a 1955 Packard & didn't name the leader, "Esther Williams". I liked the movie & it's in my collection. With a girl gang like The Jezebels, they make Charles Starkweather look like Pope John Paul II. That's it for now. Marcus Brainard

    Whoever said Quentin Tarantino doesn't know Exploitation? Well, I guess I did, I mean, really, what exactly was Death Proof (and Planet Terror) supposed to prove? So, Tarantino obviously doesn't know much about recreating B-movies, but the man certainly knows a quality B-movie when he sees it. Quentin Tarantino dug Jack Hill's gritty, mean-spirited, ofter humorous, gangsploitation epic so much that he made it apart of his Rolling Thunder label, and who can blame him? Switchblade Sisters is quality B-entertainment from beginning to end. I could tell I would love this movie as soon a the theme song started. Tough, trashy chicks rock, especially in the 70's. These streets are ran by a male gang, The Silver Daggers, ran by Dominic, and a female gang, the dagger debs, ran by Lace, Dominic's chipmunk-voiced girlfriend. Seemingly a happy couple at first, but after Maggie, the vicious new member of Lace's gang, threatens their relationship, Lace is so wrapped up in vengeance, that she can't even see that her position as leader might also be in question. For any guys out there in the need for something to watch with your feminist girlfriend, look no further, because Switchblade Sisters offers plenty of eye-candy as well as a a strong sense of equality for the ladies. So, any genius's out there thinking of showing the girlfriend I Spit On Your Grave, it won't be necessary.

They even join a militant gang to help boost the power of the group. When Lace re cooperates from her attack, she joins the group, only to suspect Maggie as a traitor. I like the scene where Lace beats up Maggie, and tortures her by sticking a cigarette butt in her bellybutton. Then came the showdown. Classic scene. The gang gains a new leader, while Patch is left behind. Goes to show there is no loyalty among gangs. Power shifts, and questionable leadership can destroy an organization. The Jezebels have not only ousted the men, but Lace as well, without her knowledge. They consider her a weak link in the gang. 4 out of 5 stars.

    Predating the cycle of gang movies by a few years, "The Jezebels" (a.k.a. "Switchblade Sisters") by exploitation icon Jack Hill really is a whole lot of fun. It's colourful entertainment that actually manages to be campy and serious in equal doses. And it does come complete with a feminist statement. Robbie Lee is Lace, the leader of a girl gang dubbed The Dagger Debs, who are affiliated with a male gang known as the Silver Daggers. She's sweet on Dominic (Asher Brauner), their leader. Laces' world starts falling apart when Maggie (Joanne Nail), a loner, attracts the attention of the gangs (especially Dominic) and rises within the ranks - and gains influence - a little too quickly. Amid the personal problems of the main characters, they must go to war with a gang that masquerades as community activists. Considering the fact that some of these actresses don't really convince at all as tough gals (especially Lee), and are clearly too old for their roles, they really are a whole lot of fun. Monica Gayle delivers a standout performance as Patch, a gang member who comes to distrust and despise Maggie. A rich assortment of familiar actors in the supporting roles include Marlene Clark as black revolutionary Muff, Don Stark as Hook, Bill Adler as Fingers, Kate Murtagh as butch lesbian prison guard Mom Smackley, and Bob Minor as police officer Parker. Nail definitely looks very hot in various sexy outfits. Co-star Kitty Bruce, who plays the put-upon Donut, is the daughter of Lenny Bruce. The movie contains some absolute gems of dialogue thanks to screenwriter F.X. Maier; the viewer will find them very quotable. Nails' speech to the cops right before the end credits is hilarious. There's sex and plenty of violence, and some eye catching costumes by Jodie Tillen. And you just know that this is going to a be a most enjoyable film because of the tune "Black Hearted Woman" that's belted out during the opening credits. Many fine scenes include the clich&eacute;d action in the penitentiary and the gunfights at the roller rink and in the streets. Fans of this kind of thing would be well advised to seek it out. It really hits the spot in terms of all of its exploitative elements. Nine out of 10.

    "The Jezebels" is also known as "Switchblade Sisters". And, whatever you call it, it's complete crap. Now this is NOT meant as criticism. It's obvious the folks making this wanted to make a trashy movie and boy did they make a nasty, crappy picture!! It's violent, stupid and even promotes the old rape myth! So, it certainly is not a film to show your mother or Father Jenkins. The film begins with a gang of female punks attacking Maggie in a restaurant. Next thing you know, the ladies are in jail and the leader and intended victim become best friends! Soon, when they are all out of stir, the gang welcomes the newest recruit, Maggie, by raping her. Nice folks, huh? But the victim isn't particularly put out by this and soon she helps them in a gang war. And, before you know it, Maggie is their leader and makes friends with a local lady Black Panthers group and the war is on! But there is a traitor within the gang and Maggie's reign might be coming to a swift end. And, when the film ends, it sure looks as if there will be a sequel--which there wasn't. There really isn't a lot of good in the film. It's super-violent and sadistic and unrepentantly nasty. And, because of that, the film is, in a sick way, quite entertaining---sort of a guilty pleasure if you are a bad movie buff.

    The Dagger Debs are a gang of snarling girls, and Maggie (Joanne Nail) is their newest member. Lace (Robbie Lee), the ever tooth-gritting leader, befriends her but soon has doubts -- it seems Lace's man Dominic (Asher Brauner), head of the Silver Daggers, fancies the new recruit. Director Jack Hill, one of my idols and a swell guy, has had some strange things to say about this film. He has said the script was inspired by "Othello", and has also claimed to interview real female gang members before making the movie. And yet, he readily admits the whole thing is a "wacky fantasy"... The film not only has jail, gang fights and more... it has a pregnancy subplot! How do you beat that? While this may be no social commentary, it really does its best to be an exploitation classic (and it comes as no surprise that Quentin Tarantino has been the biggest supporter of this film.)

    Switchblade Sisters (1975) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Trashy cult classic from Jack Hill has new girl Maggie (Joanne Nail) joining up with a female gang being ran by Lace (Robbie Lee) but soon everyone's loyalty is tested when a rival gang causes trouble. If you're looking for a thought-provoking, deep and serious look at females in trouble then it's best you go check out some talky foreign film. If you want sleaze, nudity, violence, cat fights and that sort of thing then Jack Hill's film is just what you're looking for. It's easy to watch this film and realize why it has become a cult favorite over the years because there are just so many classic scenes within the genre. While the film isn't perfect and there are certainly some weak moments, there's still no question that the film contains some of the best scenes from this type of exploitation picture. One such scene happens rather early on when the girls are sentenced to a jail and they come under attack from a large woman who is the boss. What happens during the two attack scenes are just priceless and will have the viewer rolling. Another terrific scene happens towards the middle when there's a violent gun battle at a roller rink. Purely priceless this scene is. The performances aren't what we'd consider "good" but I think everyone fits their roles just fine. This is especially true of Nail and Lee. It's also fun seeing Lenny Bruce's daughter Kitty in the cast as Donut. Hill keeps the film moving at a very good pace and there's all sorts of fun to be had throughout. SWITCHBLADE SISTERS deserves its cult reputation without question.

    SWITCHBLADE SISTERS/THE JEZEBELS- 1976. My friend, Bob, made a connection with the Extras Casting Director at New World Entertainment, in Hollywood, California. I was interviewed and assigned a role as a "cop". My wife was assigned a role as a "street person". We would each earn $20 a day, plus catered meals. Early one morning, we assembled at a defunct Tasty-Freeze Drive-in restaurant in Eagle Rock, CA. I was given a "Metropolitan Police Uniform", a "flack jacket", a helmet and a "Billy Club". My first duty was to drive a "Police Car" full of other "Officers" to the curb in front of the Drive-in. We disembarked and chased after the "Dagger Debs", who had scattered upon our arrival. I located one of the Debs behind a dumpster in the rear of the property. I grabbed her wrist and put a (gentle) Hammerlock on her arm. With my club raised to strike, I marched her towards the camera. Suddenly she snarled, "Let go, you Son-of-a Bitch". Forgetting that she was an actress, I thought I was hurting her, so I released the hold. The Director yelled, "Cut". And that scene went onto the Cutting Room floor! Then, my friend Bob was instructed to frisk another Deb for weapons. Being a very religious, family man, he kept his hands about five inches away from her body. The Director finally yelled for him to," feel her up". He blushed as he complied! My wife (in a blue dress) and two other "street persons" sat at tables in front of the Drive-in when the Debs showed up. The ladies "fled" and the scene was completed. On a subsequent evening, we assembled at a vacant pottery factory in Glendale, CA. This was the clubhouse of the Debs. Following their well-orchestrated Knife Fight, we cops burst into the building. I grabbed one of the girls by her ponytail and pulled her head against the end of a shotgun. (That was cut). Finally, I got a full-face scene as I loaded the girls into the police van. As we rehearsed, I would grab and roughly shove them into the vehicle. But, then I would gently help them down for the next practice. You may notice that my "flack vest" is worn wrong side out. It was very late when I got home, so I got ready for bed in the dark. Only in the morning, did my wife see that my arms were covered with blood (fake)! My wife & I had only observed the filming of our respective scenes, so we looked forward to the movie's release at a theater. We took our 14 year-old son to see it on screen. Holy Smokes! The language, the suggestive body actions  we were so embarrassed! But our son said it was just like Junior Hi-school!

    Jack Hill also did Coffy & did a good job about updating The 1963-era "Birmingham Angel" to Pam Grier. I wonder if Pam Grier remembered, "Birmingham Sunday"? The Jezebels got some reinforcement from a black girl group that followed Mao. However In life I've seen a black girl with a 1955 Packard Clipper beat up a bully in real life back in 1963. The urban assault car came from a 1955 Packard Patrician 4-Dr. Sedan so Jack Hill & I met halfway. Kitty Bruce's Donut was a thankless character, but she was loyal to the end. The Movie was unreal in some parts, but people actually think they can get away with it but in reality check, you get it in the end. If I did the screen writing, The black girl gang led by Muff would be shown as spirits & have 1950s cars with lethal death rays installed in them and poisoned black smoke & the led car would be a 1955 Packard Clipper Sedan & when the black girl gang leave the scene a mist is used and they go into the mist and vanish. And when they unleash there weapons on Crabs' Teen Patrol they would yell: "We didn't forget what happened on Birmingham Sunday, on September 15, 1963 & this one is for Denise McNair & her fellow school girls!" and they would zap The Teen Patrol with death rays & vaporized them & get most of the members. However Crabs gets it by Lace. The movie was good and Jack Hill met me halfway with the urban assault vehicle made from a 1955 Packard & didn't name the leader, "Esther Williams". I liked the movie & it's in my collection. With a girl gang like The Jezebels, they make Charles Starkweather look like Pope John Paul II. That's it for now. Marcus Brainard

    Whoever said Quentin Tarantino doesn't know Exploitation? Well, I guess I did, I mean, really, what exactly was Death Proof (and Planet Terror) supposed to prove? So, Tarantino obviously doesn't know much about recreating B-movies, but the man certainly knows a quality B-movie when he sees it. Quentin Tarantino dug Jack Hill's gritty, mean-spirited, ofter humorous, gangsploitation epic so much that he made it apart of his Rolling Thunder label, and who can blame him? Switchblade Sisters is quality B-entertainment from beginning to end. I could tell I would love this movie as soon a the theme song started. Tough, trashy chicks rock, especially in the 70's. These streets are ran by a male gang, The Silver Daggers, ran by Dominic, and a female gang, the dagger debs, ran by Lace, Dominic's chipmunk-voiced girlfriend. Seemingly a happy couple at first, but after Maggie, the vicious new member of Lace's gang, threatens their relationship, Lace is so wrapped up in vengeance, that she can't even see that her position as leader might also be in question. For any guys out there in the need for something to watch with your feminist girlfriend, look no further, because Switchblade Sisters offers plenty of eye-candy as well as a a strong sense of equality for the ladies. So, any genius's out there thinking of showing the girlfriend I Spit On Your Grave, it won't be necessary. Switchblade Sisters isn't nearly as inept as most Exploitation movies, and it's cool and all that Tarantino released it, but we need a badass release from a real B-movie label, like Something Weird Video, or even Troma. But then again, at least it's out there. Any fans of sleazy Exploitation, sleazy humor, and sleazy women, should find this movie to be nothing short of delightful. Yay for Switchblade Sisters!! 8/10

    The Dagger Debs, tough-talking high school broads with switchblade knives, benevolent snarls, attitude to spare, and propensity for violence, striking fear in the hearts of the citizens on the streets, are on equal footing with a the male Silver Daggers, a bossy, nasty brood whose harsh bullying ways leave the community they frequent cuckolded in a state of quivering angst. Soon a rival gang must attend the Daggers' school due to theirs closing, and a struggle for dominance ensues. Each gang has their own turf, which the other doesn't dare cross into. Crabs, quite old to be still in high school, has a much larger gang than his mortal enemy, Dominick, and runs high enterprise in dope-dealing through the facade of a community organizing group schmoozing with the mayor while selling drugs to the youth they're supposed to be helping. The film's central arch is a love triangle gone terribly wrong. Dominick(Asher Brauner), leader of the Silver Daggers, and Lace(Robbie Lee), leader of the Debs, are an item. Enter Maggie(Joanne Nail), new to their side of the city who gets in an altercation with the Dagger Debs' Patch(Monica Gayle), showing her courage and strength, twirling a mean chain which trips her foes before assaulting them further. Dominick is drawn to Maggie, it's a type of lust Patch recognizes, and capitalizes on when she notices this newcomer moving in on her best friend, Lace. Lace is completely obsessed with Dominick, although she's just a piece of ass to him. When Dominick infuriates Lace after blowing up into a tirade towards her about the revelation of carrying his child, she gets even by informing Crabs of a strategic attack on them at a neutral site, a roller rink, resulting in a bloody shootout which takes out innocent bystanders, among other cataclysmic results. With the Silver Daggers deeply wounded, the Debs must assume control, with Maggie more than willing to take the leadership position after Crabs kicked Lace in the stomach causing a miscarriage. Aligning herself with a bad ass group of sistas who follow the political teachings of Mao, led by Muff(Marlene Clark), the newly named Jezebels prepare to conquer Crabs, crushing his regime, disintegrating his stranglehold on the a specific part of the city. But, what Maggie doesn't realize is that Patch and Lace are planning to murder her, getting rid of the one responsible for taking Dominick away from her. Maggie wants to uncover the culprit behind informing Crabs of the proposed strike at the roller rink, not knowing that it was actually Lace. As expected, the two girls will have to duke it out for supremacy of the Jezebels. With lots of quotable dialogue and campy performances, it's hard to resist such a film as Switchblade Sisters, certainly when you realize that the premise concerns a white girl gang who can actually cause fear in citizens. Switchblade Sisters kind of reminds me of those 50's juvy films confronting the gang mentality and how it's controlling the school system and streets, breeding crime that's swallowing the youth, turning them into unlawful monsters. Transplant such a genre to the 70's, add extra seediness, vulgarity, violence, and current themes of that time that were prevalent(..there was a sentiment of anger towards the police and capitalist society)and it's easy to see why this would appeal to a cult audience. And, as Jack Hill always did, inject a cast of babes in the roles of the protagonists. You gotta love the scene where Maggie knocks Don Stark(..Dagger member, Hook, often slapping girls around)for a loop or Lace's psychopathia and mad ravings. Oh, and Patch..now this is a character that belongs in a Jack Hill gang film. Switchblade Sisters is directed in such a way that you can't take it the least bit seriously, and if you accept it on it's own terms, I can't imagine an exploitation fan not enjoying it. Robbie Lee isn't contained and lets it rip, playing her role as the confrontational Lace to the hilt, with Nail, in her short shorts, delivering her lines with gusto, staring her opposition right in the eyes, unflinchingly, ready for a fight. Nail might be considered unacceptable in such a role in any other film, but Jack Hill made it work. Gayle is my gal, though, as Patch, a ferocious back-stabbing bitch who persuades Lace to commit unspeakable acts that cause major repercussions which change the landscape of their lives, disrupting a harmony her gang had before Maggie came along. The juvenile prison scene, albeit brief, was a hoot as the girls lead a full on assault on the female guards who were on the verge of accosting Maggie. The way the faculty are muzzled by the Daggers and Debs, completely overwhelmed psychologically, afraid to voice their concerns about the dissension of their students, is rather hilarious. You actually get two great closing fights, the Jezebels and Muff's girls besieging Crab's soldiers, and the knife battle between Maggie and Lace. The scene where Maggie, with a bloody face, warns the coppers that when they return, there'll be hell to pay, is priceless.

    In the 70s, when women's lib became as much a part of civil rights as race issues, many films portrayed women as being just as vicious as men. I think that this factor often resulted from male studio heads and producers, who were threatened by women's increasing demands for equality in society. As a result, many films with female characters, were portrayed as being even more dangerous than the most violent of males. The Jezebels is a film, that's a perfect example of this 'woman as more deadly than the male' mentality. The film revolves around a group of teen girls, who form a gang called the Jezebels. They all come from dysfunctional families, and live in a crumbling, tenement apartment building. The girls dress in funky, rough-looking leather jackets and torn jeans. They all carry switch-blade knives, and know how to use them. Their boyfriends have their own gang, and they all hang together with the Jezebels, in an abandoned warehouse. These tough kids are all in constant, bloody battles with rival gangs, the police, and even each other. When a drug kingpin threatens their survival, the huge battle that results, severely tests the loyalties of the Jezebels to each other, and to their boyfriends. There's no shortage of car chases, shootings, knifings, and general all-around mayhem in this movie. All of this overwhelms the film, and gives it a tacky, melodramatic quality. The performances of virtually all the actors, are fraught with hammy overacting. It's only a mildly entertaining movie, at best.
