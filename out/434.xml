    Yep, they were. Red leather, lovely 30's inspired decor, a minimum of screens & flashing lights. In fact I consider the minimalist layout to be much MORE hi-tech than the cluttered ships we usually see. Much of the dreary stuff is hidden from view. It makes the film seem quite modern (sort of). The Robinsons from "Lost in Space" shopped at the same Galactic Supa- Centre - they bought a scaled down ship, less expensive gear & a cheaper version of Robby but you can easily see the lineage. The special effects must have seemed pretty excellent back in the day because they still look good. Nice laser shots, the monster is well done, all in all they did a really good job. Sure, there are some holes in the plot but it isn't Shakespeare, it's a really good example of Science Fiction. Much, much better than I expected.

    'Forbidden Planet' is truly high among the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made, and later notable works such as 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars', etc. would be heavily influenced by it. With a story that enthralls the viewer with the wonders of Space, the VFX remain nothing less than astounding and wholly effective; its moody early-Electronica score further lends to the engrossing wonder, convincing the viewer on some deeper level that they're hearing what might be the celestial vibrations of our vast and infinite Universe. Based on William Shakespeare's 'The Tempest', 'Forbidden Planet' is a genuine cinematic and Science-Fiction masterpiece, one that ever continues to convey a sense of awe to this very day.

    Movie was released 5 yrs. before I was born, but still withstands the test of time. Robby The Robot and of course then still very enticing Ann Francis stole the show, still remember the sound of that motion sensor. How powerful was that Krill machine? I knew it could create images, but could it materialize solid objects as well, oh well, whatever, I remember Earl Holliman's character having Robby analyze that whiskey, and then Robby mass producing it for him. As for IMDb's Ann Francis biography describing her figure as voluptuous then women for years have been using the word incorrectly, because those who use the term to describe their physique are Full Figure (i.e.) chunky. Anne was actually 1 of the few back in those days that had a somewhat athletic figure, there were plenty of buxom blonde haired actresses, but firm figures none I am aware of other than Anne. Almost all leading cast deceased Walter Pidgeon, Warren Stevens, which by the way when he played Rojan in Classic Trek episode By Any Other Name he was already 48 almost Shatner's and Nimoy's senior by 11 yrs., Jack Kelly, Leslie Nielsen, and Anne Francis all deceased. Shame Anne chose not to pursue a more active acting career, true I do not find moles or birthmarks appealing, but with a figure like that just maybe I could see past it. What is it with some actresses they they seem to be oblivious to flaws that if removed or reconstructed they would be absolutely stunning. Consider Barbara Steisand and her nose as in being too big only a fool would say he is attracted to her because of her big nose. When I think of her it brings to mind a scene from the movie Funny Girl the 1 with her wearing that plunging neckline dress, hubba, hubba. As for Earl Holliman simply referred to as the Cook, he played Lt. Bill Crowley in Police Woman he will be 85 09/'13, Richard Anderson who played Oscar Goldman in the Six Million Dollar Man will be 87 in 08/'13. Did they not set the Krill machine to self destruct at the end in essence destroying the whole planet, oh well they saved the hot babe and the somewhat valuable piece of technology. J.J. Abrams could learn something by reviewing these classic Sci-Fi movies his Star Trek plots would not seem so much like something written by Alfred E. Newman.

    The plot of Forbidden Planet is so well known to most I won't go over it much here. I have to say that FP is certainly one of the two, or three best sci-fi films of the 1950s. It Came from Outer Space and This Island Earth are two more which a strong argument for being "the best" can be made. True enough, some of the effects are a bit on the hokey side by modern standards, but this was 1956, after all, remember. It is good to have some examples of Leslie Nielsen playing serious roles around, and this film is one of his best. I do think some of the dialog is a bit too much like a World War Two film at times, but WW II was only eleven years in the past when Forbidden Planet was produced. And like most, I cold have done as well without the comedy of Earl Holliman's cook character - I can understand why the movie isn't one of his favorites, for this was a thankless role. I also was knocked out by Anne Francis like every other male who's ever seen this film, even if she perhaps a bit too old for portraying a twenty-year old. She has a number of genre credits, including two classic appearances on the original Twilight Zone, by the way. Some have complained of the fact that cruiser C-57-D was a flying saucer(the first ever shown with a human crew, I believe), but the 1950s was the heyday of UFOs - the ship does fine to me. I do feel the preaching at the end was a bit corny perhaps by modern standards; movie audiences of the period were generally much more of the "there are some things man(or here, Krell) were not meant to know" school of thinking, as were most scriptwriters, of course. Not much else to add save that Robby the Robot remains probably the best film robot to date - he appeared on the Twilight Zone as well as numerous other TV shows at least into the 1970s, including Wonder Woman, I believe. For those interested in novelizations, one was published in '56 as Forbidden Planet by W.J. Stuart, at a time when this wasn't often done.

    "Forbidden Planet" has a lot of the elements of corny '50s sci-fi movies. It shows off its special effects in masturbatory fashion, features a robot, loads the dialogue up with esoteric science babble and portrays its one female character in misogynistic fashion (oh wait, that's all '50s movies). But "Forbidden Planet" doesn't simply trying to cash in on fans of "Flash Gordon" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still." Buried beneath it all is an ideal mystery plot with an intelligent payoff. The film follows a space crew investigating the sudden silence on Altair IV. Upon landing which they were warned not to dothey discover only Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) have survived (and let's not forget Robby the Robot). The intrepid Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen), Doc (Warren Stevens) and the playboy Lt. Farman (Jack Kelly) investigate and find that Morbius is hiding something from them. "Forbidden Planet" is a special effects showcase, sometimes to a fault as scenes are designed almost exclusively around the movie magic, but compare it with the excessive CGI carnage of today's blockbusters and it's not something of which you can be all that critical. Besides, the weapon design, costume design and set design are all cohesive and tasteful, and in some cases marvelous. The plot does take a long time to get somewhere. A lot of the plot gets lost in writer Cyril Hume's aforementioned display of gadgetry and in the romantic subplot between Altaira and just about everyone else, but it ends up being worth the wait. The mystery at the heart of the film doesn't have an contemporary counterparts, and most films targeted at a genre audience like this one don't sneak in powerful human themes. No doubt Hume honored Irving Block and Allen Adler's "Twilight Zone"-esque story in doing so. In terms of acting, Pidgeon, playing Morbius, the man who keeps that secret, sells us with his passionate performance, especially at the end. Like all great sci fi, "Forbidden Planet" also plays with the notion of what's unseen. Perhaps Ridley Scott took some notes from director Fred M. Wilcox when he made "Alien," because the film hints at a frightening beast that it never shows and manages to wield a lot of suspense doing so. And you know it's legit, because clearly special effects and even makeup were not convincing enough in the mid-'50s to deliver a powerful creature reveal. Even though what comes you know won't measure up to your imagination, Wilcox has your imagination working, and that's the key. Also, the film's electronic soundtrack (eons ahead of its time) has to get a lot of credit (especially for the suspense part). You expect the usual cheesy suspense strings in '50s films, but "Forbidden Planet" retains an aura of mystery to this day I think in large part to a score that doesn't telegraphic any of the plot's moves. Although long stretches can be disengaging, and everything surrounding Altaira is pretty stupid, "Forbidden Planet" has its place in the canon of influential science-fiction movies. When you consider that the film's producers probably just wanted to make "an outer space picture," the end result is more than we could ask for. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    Released in 1956, I didn't see "Forbidden Planet" until a full 40 years later. I've seen it three more times since then and here's what strikes me: For one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in "Forbidden Planet," which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!). You name it: warp drive, Captain/First Officer/Doctor triumvirate, babe in ultra-sexy outfits, beam down/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in "Forbidden Planet." The invisible id monster is truly horrifying when finally viewed. It looks like a serious rendition of the Tasmanian Devil. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this brief paragraph if you don't want to know the monster's true identity. The concept that the monster is, in reality, the personification of Dr. Morbius' lower subconscious nature (i.e. the id, "flesh" or carnal psyche) is a fascinating revelation. ***END SPOILER*** I wasn't at all expecting such mature commentary in a 50's sci-fi flick. Furthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is fascinating to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well. One thing that really blows me away every time I catch this flick, of course, is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira (or Alta for short), in her ultra skimpy (and cute) outfits. It doesn't matter what profound matters are going on in the film, if she's present in a scene with one of her various outfits, my eyes are completely focused on HER -- in utter awe of her jaw-dropping beauty. If you're a red-blooded male and think I'm kidding, check out the flick and see for yourself. I've heard some people complain about the scene where we are led to believe that Alta (Francis) is skinny-dipping, only to plainly observe that she's wearing a loose skin-colored bathing suit. Is this a cop-out on the film-maker's part because it was 1956? Not at all because the bathing suit is clearly visible once she steps out of the water. Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!). Please remember that "Forbidden Planet" is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come. GRADE: A

    For it's time, it was something special...a science fiction movie with a lavish MGM budget. The technical stuff is great and the composition of the landscape scenes are very good. I heard that preview audiences laughed at the final scenes where the "monster" was shown. They didn't change anything, evidently after the previews. It's a disappointment to see the evil monster as cartoon animation...even for audiences of the time. It's important to understand its place in the evolution of science fiction films as the next step was the far superior 2001: A Space Odyssey. I really think this movie is overrated. It has an interesting set design, the "music" gets on your nerves after a while, the plot plods along. The men lust after the woman, the woman lusts after the men...it's kind of a low budget story with a high budget for technical effects and sets. Think Queen of Outer Space or World Without End with a bigger budget. Yes, there's the whole ID part of the story and that makes it more "heady" but this film is really dull in many places. It isn't in the same league as Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Day the Earth Stood Still for 50s science fiction. The movie is worth seeing but I look forward to the remake.

    A star ship crew goes to investigate the silence of a planet's colony only to find two survivors and a deadly secret that one of them has. I love that this film was based on Shakespeare -- who would have ever thought such an English master could have inspired a science fiction film so legendary? Why was the moon landing in 2090 rather than 1969... and why does the new planet have coordinates based on north and west? Methinks the script was not fact-checked by people who actually knew science (of course, they did not know the moon landing was 1969 -- but to put it almost 150 years in the future seems absurd). Great effects for the time it was made, pretty much twenty years ahead of its time. Not only did it inspire "Star Trek", but the effects are on par with the original "Star Wars" in many ways.

    There is so much here that is buried fifty miles deep in post-war 1950's naivet&eacute; that it almost, but doesn't, ruin some of the great aspects that removes it from the low-budget contemporaries abundant in the time frame. A number of things that keep this from descending to dreary land is the impressive look of the whole thing. It is part Art-Deco, part pulp cover enchantment, and all 1950's kitsch and the new electronic sounds had quite a futuristic appeal. A great looking Flying Saucer navigates the stars and lands on a desolate Demon haunted world. It is the origin of the Demons that is at the heart of the complex story. The scenes of Krell technology and subterranean structures are awe inspiring and the unfolding of their History and knowledge keeps your interest. But, Robby the Robot notwithstanding, the comedy relief is anything but. It is so painfully dated and along with the crew behaving like the Big Red One, the script tries and almost succeeds in creating Camp. So, it is for the better, influential and rather amazing rest, that its shortfalls can be forgiven. Because the best is so powerful it zaps and blasts into irrelevance the peripheral pandering presented in such predictable Fifties conservatism and ethnocentrism. Note: The original poster for this Movie is one of the most sought after and expensive of its kind. It is, like this Movie, a Doozy.

    I went and saw this when it came out on the big screen, a Quaker Oats box top in my chubby little hands, heh heh. (Yes kiddies, you used to be able to see movies in a theater by just bringing proof you bought cereal, or a couple cans of veggies to help feed the needy. I will never forget the awe Forbidden Planet inspired in me at that early age, the dreams of traveling through space to distant planets. I'm sure it was the basis of my support for science and our quest for cost effective space exploration. Oh sure, young people today will undoubtedly have a hard time relating to fx of 60 years ago comparing to the cgi of today's movies. Perhaps a few might appreciate the hard work that went into choreographing blue screen acting with gel slide animation. And those fx were astoundingly produced in this one. I would hope younger people will try this out, just to help them appreciate the technology they enjoy today. Truly, the story is believable, without putting yourself out, so it is worth buying it on DVD for a nostalgic look into our scifi history. The Forbidden Planet, and The Day The Earth Stood Still led the way toward respectability in the Science Fiction genre...

Although long stretches can be disengaging, and everything surrounding Altaira is pretty stupid, "Forbidden Planet" has its place in the canon of influential science-fiction movies. When you consider that the film's producers probably just wanted to make "an outer space picture," the end result is more than we could ask for. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    Released in 1956, I didn't see "Forbidden Planet" until a full 40 years later. I've seen it three more times since then and here's what strikes me: For one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in "Forbidden Planet," which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!). You name it: warp drive, Captain/First Officer/Doctor triumvirate, babe in ultra-sexy outfits, beam down/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in "Forbidden Planet." The invisible id monster is truly horrifying when finally viewed. It looks like a serious rendition of the Tasmanian Devil. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this brief paragraph if you don't want to know the monster's true identity. The concept that the monster is, in reality, the personification of Dr. Morbius' lower subconscious nature (i.e. the id, "flesh" or carnal psyche) is a fascinating revelation. ***END SPOILER*** I wasn't at all expecting such mature commentary in a 50's sci-fi flick. Furthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is fascinating to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well. One thing that really blows me away every time I catch this flick, of course, is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira (or Alta for short), in her ultra skimpy (and cute) outfits. It doesn't matter what profound matters are going on in the film, if she's present in a scene with one of her various outfits, my eyes are completely focused on HER -- in utter awe of her jaw-dropping beauty. If you're a red-blooded male and think I'm kidding, check out the flick and see for yourself. I've heard some people complain about the scene where we are led to believe that Alta (Francis) is skinny-dipping, only to plainly observe that she's wearing a loose skin-colored bathing suit. Is this a cop-out on the film-maker's part because it was 1956? Not at all because the bathing suit is clearly visible once she steps out of the water. Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!). Please remember that "Forbidden Planet" is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come. GRADE: A

    For it's time, it was something special...a science fiction movie with a lavish MGM budget. The technical stuff is great and the composition of the landscape scenes are very good. I heard that preview audiences laughed at the final scenes where the "monster" was shown. They didn't change anything, evidently after the previews. It's a disappointment to see the evil monster as cartoon animation...even for audiences of the time. It's important to understand its place in the evolution of science fiction films as the next step was the far superior 2001: A Space Odyssey. I really think this movie is overrated. It has an interesting set design, the "music" gets on your nerves after a while, the plot plods along. The men lust after the woman, the woman lusts after the men...it's kind of a low budget story with a high budget for technical effects and sets. Think Queen of Outer Space or World Without End with a bigger budget. Yes, there's the whole ID part of the story and that makes it more "heady" but this film is really dull in many places. It isn't in the same league as Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Day the Earth Stood Still for 50s science fiction. The movie is worth seeing but I look forward to the remake.

    A star ship crew goes to investigate the silence of a planet's colony only to find two survivors and a deadly secret that one of them has. I love that this film was based on Shakespeare -- who would have ever thought such an English master could have inspired a science fiction film so legendary? Why was the moon landing in 2090 rather than 1969... and why does the new planet have coordinates based on north and west? Methinks the script was not fact-checked by people who actually knew science (of course, they did not know the moon landing was 1969 -- but to put it almost 150 years in the future seems absurd). Great effects for the time it was made, pretty much twenty years ahead of its time. Not only did it inspire "Star Trek", but the effects are on par with the original "Star Wars" in many ways.

    There is so much here that is buried fifty miles deep in post-war 1950's naivet&eacute; that it almost, but doesn't, ruin some of the great aspects that removes it from the low-budget contemporaries abundant in the time frame. A number of things that keep this from descending to dreary land is the impressive look of the whole thing. It is part Art-Deco, part pulp cover enchantment, and all 1950's kitsch and the new electronic sounds had quite a futuristic appeal. A great looking Flying Saucer navigates the stars and lands on a desolate Demon haunted world. It is the origin of the Demons that is at the heart of the complex story. The scenes of Krell technology and subterranean structures are awe inspiring and the unfolding of their History and knowledge keeps your interest. But, Robby the Robot notwithstanding, the comedy relief is anything but. It is so painfully dated and along with the crew behaving like the Big Red One, the script tries and almost succeeds in creating Camp. So, it is for the better, influential and rather amazing rest, that its shortfalls can be forgiven. Because the best is so powerful it zaps and blasts into irrelevance the peripheral pandering presented in such predictable Fifties conservatism and ethnocentrism. Note: The original poster for this Movie is one of the most sought after and expensive of its kind. It is, like this Movie, a Doozy.

    I went and saw this when it came out on the big screen, a Quaker Oats box top in my chubby little hands, heh heh. (Yes kiddies, you used to be able to see movies in a theater by just bringing proof you bought cereal, or a couple cans of veggies to help feed the needy. I will never forget the awe Forbidden Planet inspired in me at that early age, the dreams of traveling through space to distant planets. I'm sure it was the basis of my support for science and our quest for cost effective space exploration. Oh sure, young people today will undoubtedly have a hard time relating to fx of 60 years ago comparing to the cgi of today's movies. Perhaps a few might appreciate the hard work that went into choreographing blue screen acting with gel slide animation. And those fx were astoundingly produced in this one. I would hope younger people will try this out, just to help them appreciate the technology they enjoy today. Truly, the story is believable, without putting yourself out, so it is worth buying it on DVD for a nostalgic look into our scifi history. The Forbidden Planet, and The Day The Earth Stood Still led the way toward respectability in the Science Fiction genre...

    Yep, they were. Red leather, lovely 30's inspired decor, a minimum of screens & flashing lights. In fact I consider the minimalist layout to be much MORE hi-tech than the cluttered ships we usually see. Much of the dreary stuff is hidden from view. It makes the film seem quite modern (sort of). The Robinsons from "Lost in Space" shopped at the same Galactic Supa- Centre - they bought a scaled down ship, less expensive gear & a cheaper version of Robby but you can easily see the lineage. The special effects must have seemed pretty excellent back in the day because they still look good. Nice laser shots, the monster is well done, all in all they did a really good job. Sure, there are some holes in the plot but it isn't Shakespeare, it's a really good example of Science Fiction. Much, much better than I expected.

    'Forbidden Planet' is truly high among the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made, and later notable works such as 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars', etc. would be heavily influenced by it. With a story that enthralls the viewer with the wonders of Space, the VFX remain nothing less than astounding and wholly effective; its moody early-Electronica score further lends to the engrossing wonder, convincing the viewer on some deeper level that they're hearing what might be the celestial vibrations of our vast and infinite Universe. Based on William Shakespeare's 'The Tempest', 'Forbidden Planet' is a genuine cinematic and Science-Fiction masterpiece, one that ever continues to convey a sense of awe to this very day.

    Movie was released 5 yrs. before I was born, but still withstands the test of time. Robby The Robot and of course then still very enticing Ann Francis stole the show, still remember the sound of that motion sensor. How powerful was that Krill machine? I knew it could create images, but could it materialize solid objects as well, oh well, whatever, I remember Earl Holliman's character having Robby analyze that whiskey, and then Robby mass producing it for him. As for IMDb's Ann Francis biography describing her figure as voluptuous then women for years have been using the word incorrectly, because those who use the term to describe their physique are Full Figure (i.e.) chunky. Anne was actually 1 of the few back in those days that had a somewhat athletic figure, there were plenty of buxom blonde haired actresses, but firm figures none I am aware of other than Anne. Almost all leading cast deceased Walter Pidgeon, Warren Stevens, which by the way when he played Rojan in Classic Trek episode By Any Other Name he was already 48 almost Shatner's and Nimoy's senior by 11 yrs., Jack Kelly, Leslie Nielsen, and Anne Francis all deceased. Shame Anne chose not to pursue a more active acting career, true I do not find moles or birthmarks appealing, but with a figure like that just maybe I could see past it. What is it with some actresses they they seem to be oblivious to flaws that if removed or reconstructed they would be absolutely stunning. Consider Barbara Steisand and her nose as in being too big only a fool would say he is attracted to her because of her big nose. When I think of her it brings to mind a scene from the movie Funny Girl the 1 with her wearing that plunging neckline dress, hubba, hubba. As for Earl Holliman simply referred to as the Cook, he played Lt. Bill Crowley in Police Woman he will be 85 09/'13, Richard Anderson who played Oscar Goldman in the Six Million Dollar Man will be 87 in 08/'13. Did they not set the Krill machine to self destruct at the end in essence destroying the whole planet, oh well they saved the hot babe and the somewhat valuable piece of technology. J.J. Abrams could learn something by reviewing these classic Sci-Fi movies his Star Trek plots would not seem so much like something written by Alfred E. Newman.

    The plot of Forbidden Planet is so well known to most I won't go over it much here. I have to say that FP is certainly one of the two, or three best sci-fi films of the 1950s. It Came from Outer Space and This Island Earth are two more which a strong argument for being "the best" can be made. True enough, some of the effects are a bit on the hokey side by modern standards, but this was 1956, after all, remember. It is good to have some examples of Leslie Nielsen playing serious roles around, and this film is one of his best. I do think some of the dialog is a bit too much like a World War Two film at times, but WW II was only eleven years in the past when Forbidden Planet was produced. And like most, I cold have done as well without the comedy of Earl Holliman's cook character - I can understand why the movie isn't one of his favorites, for this was a thankless role. I also was knocked out by Anne Francis like every other male who's ever seen this film, even if she perhaps a bit too old for portraying a twenty-year old. She has a number of genre credits, including two classic appearances on the original Twilight Zone, by the way. Some have complained of the fact that cruiser C-57-D was a flying saucer(the first ever shown with a human crew, I believe), but the 1950s was the heyday of UFOs - the ship does fine to me. I do feel the preaching at the end was a bit corny perhaps by modern standards; movie audiences of the period were generally much more of the "there are some things man(or here, Krell) were not meant to know" school of thinking, as were most scriptwriters, of course. Not much else to add save that Robby the Robot remains probably the best film robot to date - he appeared on the Twilight Zone as well as numerous other TV shows at least into the 1970s, including Wonder Woman, I believe. For those interested in novelizations, one was published in '56 as Forbidden Planet by W.J. Stuart, at a time when this wasn't often done.

    "Forbidden Planet" has a lot of the elements of corny '50s sci-fi movies. It shows off its special effects in masturbatory fashion, features a robot, loads the dialogue up with esoteric science babble and portrays its one female character in misogynistic fashion (oh wait, that's all '50s movies). But "Forbidden Planet" doesn't simply trying to cash in on fans of "Flash Gordon" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still." Buried beneath it all is an ideal mystery plot with an intelligent payoff. The film follows a space crew investigating the sudden silence on Altair IV. Upon landing which they were warned not to dothey discover only Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) have survived (and let's not forget Robby the Robot). The intrepid Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen), Doc (Warren Stevens) and the playboy Lt. Farman (Jack Kelly) investigate and find that Morbius is hiding something from them. "Forbidden Planet" is a special effects showcase, sometimes to a fault as scenes are designed almost exclusively around the movie magic, but compare it with the excessive CGI carnage of today's blockbusters and it's not something of which you can be all that critical. Besides, the weapon design, costume design and set design are all cohesive and tasteful, and in some cases marvelous. The plot does take a long time to get somewhere. A lot of the plot gets lost in writer Cyril Hume's aforementioned display of gadgetry and in the romantic subplot between Altaira and just about everyone else, but it ends up being worth the wait. The mystery at the heart of the film doesn't have an contemporary counterparts, and most films targeted at a genre audience like this one don't sneak in powerful human themes. No doubt Hume honored Irving Block and Allen Adler's "Twilight Zone"-esque story in doing so. In terms of acting, Pidgeon, playing Morbius, the man who keeps that secret, sells us with his passionate performance, especially at the end. Like all great sci fi, "Forbidden Planet" also plays with the notion of what's unseen. Perhaps Ridley Scott took some notes from director Fred M. Wilcox when he made "Alien," because the film hints at a frightening beast that it never shows and manages to wield a lot of suspense doing so. And you know it's legit, because clearly special effects and even makeup were not convincing enough in the mid-'50s to deliver a powerful creature reveal. Even though what comes you know won't measure up to your imagination, Wilcox has your imagination working, and that's the key. Also, the film's electronic soundtrack (eons ahead of its time) has to get a lot of credit (especially for the suspense part). You expect the usual cheesy suspense strings in '50s films, but "Forbidden Planet" retains an aura of mystery to this day I think in large part to a score that doesn't telegraphic any of the plot's moves. Although long stretches can be disengaging, and everything surrounding Altaira is pretty stupid, "Forbidden Planet" has its place in the canon of influential science-fiction movies. When you consider that the film's producers probably just wanted to make "an outer space picture," the end result is more than we could ask for. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

As for IMDb's Ann Francis biography describing her figure as voluptuous then women for years have been using the word incorrectly, because those who use the term to describe their physique are Full Figure (i.e.) chunky. Anne was actually 1 of the few back in those days that had a somewhat athletic figure, there were plenty of buxom blonde haired actresses, but firm figures none I am aware of other than Anne. Almost all leading cast deceased Walter Pidgeon, Warren Stevens, which by the way when he played Rojan in Classic Trek episode By Any Other Name he was already 48 almost Shatner's and Nimoy's senior by 11 yrs., Jack Kelly, Leslie Nielsen, and Anne Francis all deceased. Shame Anne chose not to pursue a more active acting career, true I do not find moles or birthmarks appealing, but with a figure like that just maybe I could see past it. What is it with some actresses they they seem to be oblivious to flaws that if removed or reconstructed they would be absolutely stunning. Consider Barbara Steisand and her nose as in being too big only a fool would say he is attracted to her because of her big nose. When I think of her it brings to mind a scene from the movie Funny Girl the 1 with her wearing that plunging neckline dress, hubba, hubba. As for Earl Holliman simply referred to as the Cook, he played Lt. Bill Crowley in Police Woman he will be 85 09/'13, Richard Anderson who played Oscar Goldman in the Six Million Dollar Man will be 87 in 08/'13. Did they not set the Krill machine to self destruct at the end in essence destroying the whole planet, oh well they saved the hot babe and the somewhat valuable piece of technology. J.J. Abrams could learn something by reviewing these classic Sci-Fi movies his Star Trek plots would not seem so much like something written by Alfred E. Newman.

    The plot of Forbidden Planet is so well known to most I won't go over it much here. I have to say that FP is certainly one of the two, or three best sci-fi films of the 1950s. It Came from Outer Space and This Island Earth are two more which a strong argument for being "the best" can be made. True enough, some of the effects are a bit on the hokey side by modern standards, but this was 1956, after all, remember. It is good to have some examples of Leslie Nielsen playing serious roles around, and this film is one of his best. I do think some of the dialog is a bit too much like a World War Two film at times, but WW II was only eleven years in the past when Forbidden Planet was produced. And like most, I cold have done as well without the comedy of Earl Holliman's cook character - I can understand why the movie isn't one of his favorites, for this was a thankless role. I also was knocked out by Anne Francis like every other male who's ever seen this film, even if she perhaps a bit too old for portraying a twenty-year old. She has a number of genre credits, including two classic appearances on the original Twilight Zone, by the way. Some have complained of the fact that cruiser C-57-D was a flying saucer(the first ever shown with a human crew, I believe), but the 1950s was the heyday of UFOs - the ship does fine to me. I do feel the preaching at the end was a bit corny perhaps by modern standards; movie audiences of the period were generally much more of the "there are some things man(or here, Krell) were not meant to know" school of thinking, as were most scriptwriters, of course. Not much else to add save that Robby the Robot remains probably the best film robot to date - he appeared on the Twilight Zone as well as numerous other TV shows at least into the 1970s, including Wonder Woman, I believe. For those interested in novelizations, one was published in '56 as Forbidden Planet by W.J. Stuart, at a time when this wasn't often done.

    "Forbidden Planet" has a lot of the elements of corny '50s sci-fi movies. It shows off its special effects in masturbatory fashion, features a robot, loads the dialogue up with esoteric science babble and portrays its one female character in misogynistic fashion (oh wait, that's all '50s movies). But "Forbidden Planet" doesn't simply trying to cash in on fans of "Flash Gordon" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still." Buried beneath it all is an ideal mystery plot with an intelligent payoff. The film follows a space crew investigating the sudden silence on Altair IV. Upon landing which they were warned not to dothey discover only Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) have survived (and let's not forget Robby the Robot). The intrepid Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen), Doc (Warren Stevens) and the playboy Lt. Farman (Jack Kelly) investigate and find that Morbius is hiding something from them. "Forbidden Planet" is a special effects showcase, sometimes to a fault as scenes are designed almost exclusively around the movie magic, but compare it with the excessive CGI carnage of today's blockbusters and it's not something of which you can be all that critical. Besides, the weapon design, costume design and set design are all cohesive and tasteful, and in some cases marvelous. The plot does take a long time to get somewhere. A lot of the plot gets lost in writer Cyril Hume's aforementioned display of gadgetry and in the romantic subplot between Altaira and just about everyone else, but it ends up being worth the wait. The mystery at the heart of the film doesn't have an contemporary counterparts, and most films targeted at a genre audience like this one don't sneak in powerful human themes. No doubt Hume honored Irving Block and Allen Adler's "Twilight Zone"-esque story in doing so. In terms of acting, Pidgeon, playing Morbius, the man who keeps that secret, sells us with his passionate performance, especially at the end. Like all great sci fi, "Forbidden Planet" also plays with the notion of what's unseen. Perhaps Ridley Scott took some notes from director Fred M. Wilcox when he made "Alien," because the film hints at a frightening beast that it never shows and manages to wield a lot of suspense doing so. And you know it's legit, because clearly special effects and even makeup were not convincing enough in the mid-'50s to deliver a powerful creature reveal. Even though what comes you know won't measure up to your imagination, Wilcox has your imagination working, and that's the key. Also, the film's electronic soundtrack (eons ahead of its time) has to get a lot of credit (especially for the suspense part). You expect the usual cheesy suspense strings in '50s films, but "Forbidden Planet" retains an aura of mystery to this day I think in large part to a score that doesn't telegraphic any of the plot's moves. Although long stretches can be disengaging, and everything surrounding Altaira is pretty stupid, "Forbidden Planet" has its place in the canon of influential science-fiction movies. When you consider that the film's producers probably just wanted to make "an outer space picture," the end result is more than we could ask for. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    Released in 1956, I didn't see "Forbidden Planet" until a full 40 years later. I've seen it three more times since then and here's what strikes me: For one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in "Forbidden Planet," which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!). You name it: warp drive, Captain/First Officer/Doctor triumvirate, babe in ultra-sexy outfits, beam down/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in "Forbidden Planet." The invisible id monster is truly horrifying when finally viewed. It looks like a serious rendition of the Tasmanian Devil. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this brief paragraph if you don't want to know the monster's true identity. The concept that the monster is, in reality, the personification of Dr. Morbius' lower subconscious nature (i.e. the id, "flesh" or carnal psyche) is a fascinating revelation. ***END SPOILER*** I wasn't at all expecting such mature commentary in a 50's sci-fi flick. Furthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is fascinating to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well. One thing that really blows me away every time I catch this flick, of course, is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira (or Alta for short), in her ultra skimpy (and cute) outfits. It doesn't matter what profound matters are going on in the film, if she's present in a scene with one of her various outfits, my eyes are completely focused on HER -- in utter awe of her jaw-dropping beauty. If you're a red-blooded male and think I'm kidding, check out the flick and see for yourself. I've heard some people complain about the scene where we are led to believe that Alta (Francis) is skinny-dipping, only to plainly observe that she's wearing a loose skin-colored bathing suit. Is this a cop-out on the film-maker's part because it was 1956? Not at all because the bathing suit is clearly visible once she steps out of the water. Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!). Please remember that "Forbidden Planet" is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come. GRADE: A

    For it's time, it was something special...a science fiction movie with a lavish MGM budget. The technical stuff is great and the composition of the landscape scenes are very good. I heard that preview audiences laughed at the final scenes where the "monster" was shown. They didn't change anything, evidently after the previews. It's a disappointment to see the evil monster as cartoon animation...even for audiences of the time. It's important to understand its place in the evolution of science fiction films as the next step was the far superior 2001: A Space Odyssey. I really think this movie is overrated. It has an interesting set design, the "music" gets on your nerves after a while, the plot plods along. The men lust after the woman, the woman lusts after the men...it's kind of a low budget story with a high budget for technical effects and sets. Think Queen of Outer Space or World Without End with a bigger budget. Yes, there's the whole ID part of the story and that makes it more "heady" but this film is really dull in many places. It isn't in the same league as Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Day the Earth Stood Still for 50s science fiction. The movie is worth seeing but I look forward to the remake.

    A star ship crew goes to investigate the silence of a planet's colony only to find two survivors and a deadly secret that one of them has. I love that this film was based on Shakespeare -- who would have ever thought such an English master could have inspired a science fiction film so legendary? Why was the moon landing in 2090 rather than 1969... and why does the new planet have coordinates based on north and west? Methinks the script was not fact-checked by people who actually knew science (of course, they did not know the moon landing was 1969 -- but to put it almost 150 years in the future seems absurd). Great effects for the time it was made, pretty much twenty years ahead of its time. Not only did it inspire "Star Trek", but the effects are on par with the original "Star Wars" in many ways.

    There is so much here that is buried fifty miles deep in post-war 1950's naivet&eacute; that it almost, but doesn't, ruin some of the great aspects that removes it from the low-budget contemporaries abundant in the time frame. A number of things that keep this from descending to dreary land is the impressive look of the whole thing. It is part Art-Deco, part pulp cover enchantment, and all 1950's kitsch and the new electronic sounds had quite a futuristic appeal. A great looking Flying Saucer navigates the stars and lands on a desolate Demon haunted world. It is the origin of the Demons that is at the heart of the complex story. The scenes of Krell technology and subterranean structures are awe inspiring and the unfolding of their History and knowledge keeps your interest. But, Robby the Robot notwithstanding, the comedy relief is anything but. It is so painfully dated and along with the crew behaving like the Big Red One, the script tries and almost succeeds in creating Camp. So, it is for the better, influential and rather amazing rest, that its shortfalls can be forgiven. Because the best is so powerful it zaps and blasts into irrelevance the peripheral pandering presented in such predictable Fifties conservatism and ethnocentrism. Note: The original poster for this Movie is one of the most sought after and expensive of its kind. It is, like this Movie, a Doozy.

    I went and saw this when it came out on the big screen, a Quaker Oats box top in my chubby little hands, heh heh. (Yes kiddies, you used to be able to see movies in a theater by just bringing proof you bought cereal, or a couple cans of veggies to help feed the needy. I will never forget the awe Forbidden Planet inspired in me at that early age, the dreams of traveling through space to distant planets. I'm sure it was the basis of my support for science and our quest for cost effective space exploration. Oh sure, young people today will undoubtedly have a hard time relating to fx of 60 years ago comparing to the cgi of today's movies. Perhaps a few might appreciate the hard work that went into choreographing blue screen acting with gel slide animation. And those fx were astoundingly produced in this one. I would hope younger people will try this out, just to help them appreciate the technology they enjoy today. Truly, the story is believable, without putting yourself out, so it is worth buying it on DVD for a nostalgic look into our scifi history. The Forbidden Planet, and The Day The Earth Stood Still led the way toward respectability in the Science Fiction genre...

    Yep, they were. Red leather, lovely 30's inspired decor, a minimum of screens & flashing lights. In fact I consider the minimalist layout to be much MORE hi-tech than the cluttered ships we usually see. Much of the dreary stuff is hidden from view. It makes the film seem quite modern (sort of). The Robinsons from "Lost in Space" shopped at the same Galactic Supa- Centre - they bought a scaled down ship, less expensive gear & a cheaper version of Robby but you can easily see the lineage. The special effects must have seemed pretty excellent back in the day because they still look good. Nice laser shots, the monster is well done, all in all they did a really good job. Sure, there are some holes in the plot but it isn't Shakespeare, it's a really good example of Science Fiction. Much, much better than I expected.

    'Forbidden Planet' is truly high among the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made, and later notable works such as 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars', etc. would be heavily influenced by it. With a story that enthralls the viewer with the wonders of Space, the VFX remain nothing less than astounding and wholly effective; its moody early-Electronica score further lends to the engrossing wonder, convincing the viewer on some deeper level that they're hearing what might be the celestial vibrations of our vast and infinite Universe. Based on William Shakespeare's 'The Tempest', 'Forbidden Planet' is a genuine cinematic and Science-Fiction masterpiece, one that ever continues to convey a sense of awe to this very day.

    A star ship crew goes to investigate the silence of a planet's colony only to find two survivors and a deadly secret that one of them has. I love that this film was based on Shakespeare -- who would have ever thought such an English master could have inspired a science fiction film so legendary? Why was the moon landing in 2090 rather than 1969... and why does the new planet have coordinates based on north and west? Methinks the script was not fact-checked by people who actually knew science (of course, they did not know the moon landing was 1969 -- but to put it almost 150 years in the future seems absurd). Great effects for the time it was made, pretty much twenty years ahead of its time. Not only did it inspire "Star Trek", but the effects are on par with the original "Star Wars" in many ways.

    There is so much here that is buried fifty miles deep in post-war 1950's naivet&eacute; that it almost, but doesn't, ruin some of the great aspects that removes it from the low-budget contemporaries abundant in the time frame. A number of things that keep this from descending to dreary land is the impressive look of the whole thing. It is part Art-Deco, part pulp cover enchantment, and all 1950's kitsch and the new electronic sounds had quite a futuristic appeal. A great looking Flying Saucer navigates the stars and lands on a desolate Demon haunted world. It is the origin of the Demons that is at the heart of the complex story. The scenes of Krell technology and subterranean structures are awe inspiring and the unfolding of their History and knowledge keeps your interest. But, Robby the Robot notwithstanding, the comedy relief is anything but. It is so painfully dated and along with the crew behaving like the Big Red One, the script tries and almost succeeds in creating Camp. So, it is for the better, influential and rather amazing rest, that its shortfalls can be forgiven. Because the best is so powerful it zaps and blasts into irrelevance the peripheral pandering presented in such predictable Fifties conservatism and ethnocentrism. Note: The original poster for this Movie is one of the most sought after and expensive of its kind. It is, like this Movie, a Doozy.

    I went and saw this when it came out on the big screen, a Quaker Oats box top in my chubby little hands, heh heh. (Yes kiddies, you used to be able to see movies in a theater by just bringing proof you bought cereal, or a couple cans of veggies to help feed the needy. I will never forget the awe Forbidden Planet inspired in me at that early age, the dreams of traveling through space to distant planets. I'm sure it was the basis of my support for science and our quest for cost effective space exploration. Oh sure, young people today will undoubtedly have a hard time relating to fx of 60 years ago comparing to the cgi of today's movies. Perhaps a few might appreciate the hard work that went into choreographing blue screen acting with gel slide animation. And those fx were astoundingly produced in this one. I would hope younger people will try this out, just to help them appreciate the technology they enjoy today. Truly, the story is believable, without putting yourself out, so it is worth buying it on DVD for a nostalgic look into our scifi history. The Forbidden Planet, and The Day The Earth Stood Still led the way toward respectability in the Science Fiction genre...

    Yep, they were. Red leather, lovely 30's inspired decor, a minimum of screens & flashing lights. In fact I consider the minimalist layout to be much MORE hi-tech than the cluttered ships we usually see. Much of the dreary stuff is hidden from view. It makes the film seem quite modern (sort of). The Robinsons from "Lost in Space" shopped at the same Galactic Supa- Centre - they bought a scaled down ship, less expensive gear & a cheaper version of Robby but you can easily see the lineage. The special effects must have seemed pretty excellent back in the day because they still look good. Nice laser shots, the monster is well done, all in all they did a really good job. Sure, there are some holes in the plot but it isn't Shakespeare, it's a really good example of Science Fiction. Much, much better than I expected.

    'Forbidden Planet' is truly high among the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made, and later notable works such as 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars', etc. would be heavily influenced by it. With a story that enthralls the viewer with the wonders of Space, the VFX remain nothing less than astounding and wholly effective; its moody early-Electronica score further lends to the engrossing wonder, convincing the viewer on some deeper level that they're hearing what might be the celestial vibrations of our vast and infinite Universe. Based on William Shakespeare's 'The Tempest', 'Forbidden Planet' is a genuine cinematic and Science-Fiction masterpiece, one that ever continues to convey a sense of awe to this very day.

    Movie was released 5 yrs. before I was born, but still withstands the test of time. Robby The Robot and of course then still very enticing Ann Francis stole the show, still remember the sound of that motion sensor. How powerful was that Krill machine? I knew it could create images, but could it materialize solid objects as well, oh well, whatever, I remember Earl Holliman's character having Robby analyze that whiskey, and then Robby mass producing it for him. As for IMDb's Ann Francis biography describing her figure as voluptuous then women for years have been using the word incorrectly, because those who use the term to describe their physique are Full Figure (i.e.) chunky. Anne was actually 1 of the few back in those days that had a somewhat athletic figure, there were plenty of buxom blonde haired actresses, but firm figures none I am aware of other than Anne. Almost all leading cast deceased Walter Pidgeon, Warren Stevens, which by the way when he played Rojan in Classic Trek episode By Any Other Name he was already 48 almost Shatner's and Nimoy's senior by 11 yrs., Jack Kelly, Leslie Nielsen, and Anne Francis all deceased. Shame Anne chose not to pursue a more active acting career, true I do not find moles or birthmarks appealing, but with a figure like that just maybe I could see past it. What is it with some actresses they they seem to be oblivious to flaws that if removed or reconstructed they would be absolutely stunning. Consider Barbara Steisand and her nose as in being too big only a fool would say he is attracted to her because of her big nose. When I think of her it brings to mind a scene from the movie Funny Girl the 1 with her wearing that plunging neckline dress, hubba, hubba. As for Earl Holliman simply referred to as the Cook, he played Lt. Bill Crowley in Police Woman he will be 85 09/'13, Richard Anderson who played Oscar Goldman in the Six Million Dollar Man will be 87 in 08/'13. Did they not set the Krill machine to self destruct at the end in essence destroying the whole planet, oh well they saved the hot babe and the somewhat valuable piece of technology. J.J. Abrams could learn something by reviewing these classic Sci-Fi movies his Star Trek plots would not seem so much like something written by Alfred E. Newman.

    The plot of Forbidden Planet is so well known to most I won't go over it much here. I have to say that FP is certainly one of the two, or three best sci-fi films of the 1950s. It Came from Outer Space and This Island Earth are two more which a strong argument for being "the best" can be made. True enough, some of the effects are a bit on the hokey side by modern standards, but this was 1956, after all, remember. It is good to have some examples of Leslie Nielsen playing serious roles around, and this film is one of his best. I do think some of the dialog is a bit too much like a World War Two film at times, but WW II was only eleven years in the past when Forbidden Planet was produced. And like most, I cold have done as well without the comedy of Earl Holliman's cook character - I can understand why the movie isn't one of his favorites, for this was a thankless role. I also was knocked out by Anne Francis like every other male who's ever seen this film, even if she perhaps a bit too old for portraying a twenty-year old. She has a number of genre credits, including two classic appearances on the original Twilight Zone, by the way. Some have complained of the fact that cruiser C-57-D was a flying saucer(the first ever shown with a human crew, I believe), but the 1950s was the heyday of UFOs - the ship does fine to me. I do feel the preaching at the end was a bit corny perhaps by modern standards; movie audiences of the period were generally much more of the "there are some things man(or here, Krell) were not meant to know" school of thinking, as were most scriptwriters, of course. Not much else to add save that Robby the Robot remains probably the best film robot to date - he appeared on the Twilight Zone as well as numerous other TV shows at least into the 1970s, including Wonder Woman, I believe. For those interested in novelizations, one was published in '56 as Forbidden Planet by W.J. Stuart, at a time when this wasn't often done.

    "Forbidden Planet" has a lot of the elements of corny '50s sci-fi movies. It shows off its special effects in masturbatory fashion, features a robot, loads the dialogue up with esoteric science babble and portrays its one female character in misogynistic fashion (oh wait, that's all '50s movies). But "Forbidden Planet" doesn't simply trying to cash in on fans of "Flash Gordon" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still." Buried beneath it all is an ideal mystery plot with an intelligent payoff. The film follows a space crew investigating the sudden silence on Altair IV. Upon landing which they were warned not to dothey discover only Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) have survived (and let's not forget Robby the Robot). The intrepid Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen), Doc (Warren Stevens) and the playboy Lt. Farman (Jack Kelly) investigate and find that Morbius is hiding something from them. "Forbidden Planet" is a special effects showcase, sometimes to a fault as scenes are designed almost exclusively around the movie magic, but compare it with the excessive CGI carnage of today's blockbusters and it's not something of which you can be all that critical. Besides, the weapon design, costume design and set design are all cohesive and tasteful, and in some cases marvelous. The plot does take a long time to get somewhere. A lot of the plot gets lost in writer Cyril Hume's aforementioned display of gadgetry and in the romantic subplot between Altaira and just about everyone else, but it ends up being worth the wait. The mystery at the heart of the film doesn't have an contemporary counterparts, and most films targeted at a genre audience like this one don't sneak in powerful human themes. No doubt Hume honored Irving Block and Allen Adler's "Twilight Zone"-esque story in doing so. In terms of acting, Pidgeon, playing Morbius, the man who keeps that secret, sells us with his passionate performance, especially at the end. Like all great sci fi, "Forbidden Planet" also plays with the notion of what's unseen. Perhaps Ridley Scott took some notes from director Fred M. Wilcox when he made "Alien," because the film hints at a frightening beast that it never shows and manages to wield a lot of suspense doing so. And you know it's legit, because clearly special effects and even makeup were not convincing enough in the mid-'50s to deliver a powerful creature reveal. Even though what comes you know won't measure up to your imagination, Wilcox has your imagination working, and that's the key. Also, the film's electronic soundtrack (eons ahead of its time) has to get a lot of credit (especially for the suspense part). You expect the usual cheesy suspense strings in '50s films, but "Forbidden Planet" retains an aura of mystery to this day I think in large part to a score that doesn't telegraphic any of the plot's moves. Although long stretches can be disengaging, and everything surrounding Altaira is pretty stupid, "Forbidden Planet" has its place in the canon of influential science-fiction movies. When you consider that the film's producers probably just wanted to make "an outer space picture," the end result is more than we could ask for. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    Released in 1956, I didn't see "Forbidden Planet" until a full 40 years later. I've seen it three more times since then and here's what strikes me: For one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in "Forbidden Planet," which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!). You name it: warp drive, Captain/First Officer/Doctor triumvirate, babe in ultra-sexy outfits, beam down/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in "Forbidden Planet." The invisible id monster is truly horrifying when finally viewed. It looks like a serious rendition of the Tasmanian Devil. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this brief paragraph if you don't want to know the monster's true identity. The concept that the monster is, in reality, the personification of Dr. Morbius' lower subconscious nature (i.e. the id, "flesh" or carnal psyche) is a fascinating revelation. ***END SPOILER*** I wasn't at all expecting such mature commentary in a 50's sci-fi flick. Furthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is fascinating to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well. One thing that really blows me away every time I catch this flick, of course, is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira (or Alta for short), in her ultra skimpy (and cute) outfits. It doesn't matter what profound matters are going on in the film, if she's present in a scene with one of her various outfits, my eyes are completely focused on HER -- in utter awe of her jaw-dropping beauty. If you're a red-blooded male and think I'm kidding, check out the flick and see for yourself. I've heard some people complain about the scene where we are led to believe that Alta (Francis) is skinny-dipping, only to plainly observe that she's wearing a loose skin-colored bathing suit. Is this a cop-out on the film-maker's part because it was 1956? Not at all because the bathing suit is clearly visible once she steps out of the water. Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!). Please remember that "Forbidden Planet" is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come. GRADE: A

    For it's time, it was something special...a science fiction movie with a lavish MGM budget. The technical stuff is great and the composition of the landscape scenes are very good. I heard that preview audiences laughed at the final scenes where the "monster" was shown. They didn't change anything, evidently after the previews. It's a disappointment to see the evil monster as cartoon animation...even for audiences of the time. It's important to understand its place in the evolution of science fiction films as the next step was the far superior 2001: A Space Odyssey. I really think this movie is overrated. It has an interesting set design, the "music" gets on your nerves after a while, the plot plods along. The men lust after the woman, the woman lusts after the men...it's kind of a low budget story with a high budget for technical effects and sets. Think Queen of Outer Space or World Without End with a bigger budget. Yes, there's the whole ID part of the story and that makes it more "heady" but this film is really dull in many places. It isn't in the same league as Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Day the Earth Stood Still for 50s science fiction. The movie is worth seeing but I look forward to the remake.

Upon landing which they were warned not to dothey discover only Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) have survived (and let's not forget Robby the Robot). The intrepid Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen), Doc (Warren Stevens) and the playboy Lt. Farman (Jack Kelly) investigate and find that Morbius is hiding something from them. "Forbidden Planet" is a special effects showcase, sometimes to a fault as scenes are designed almost exclusively around the movie magic, but compare it with the excessive CGI carnage of today's blockbusters and it's not something of which you can be all that critical. Besides, the weapon design, costume design and set design are all cohesive and tasteful, and in some cases marvelous. The plot does take a long time to get somewhere. A lot of the plot gets lost in writer Cyril Hume's aforementioned display of gadgetry and in the romantic subplot between Altaira and just about everyone else, but it ends up being worth the wait. The mystery at the heart of the film doesn't have an contemporary counterparts, and most films targeted at a genre audience like this one don't sneak in powerful human themes. No doubt Hume honored Irving Block and Allen Adler's "Twilight Zone"-esque story in doing so. In terms of acting, Pidgeon, playing Morbius, the man who keeps that secret, sells us with his passionate performance, especially at the end. Like all great sci fi, "Forbidden Planet" also plays with the notion of what's unseen. Perhaps Ridley Scott took some notes from director Fred M. Wilcox when he made "Alien," because the film hints at a frightening beast that it never shows and manages to wield a lot of suspense doing so. And you know it's legit, because clearly special effects and even makeup were not convincing enough in the mid-'50s to deliver a powerful creature reveal. Even though what comes you know won't measure up to your imagination, Wilcox has your imagination working, and that's the key. Also, the film's electronic soundtrack (eons ahead of its time) has to get a lot of credit (especially for the suspense part). You expect the usual cheesy suspense strings in '50s films, but "Forbidden Planet" retains an aura of mystery to this day I think in large part to a score that doesn't telegraphic any of the plot's moves. Although long stretches can be disengaging, and everything surrounding Altaira is pretty stupid, "Forbidden Planet" has its place in the canon of influential science-fiction movies. When you consider that the film's producers probably just wanted to make "an outer space picture," the end result is more than we could ask for. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    Released in 1956, I didn't see "Forbidden Planet" until a full 40 years later. I've seen it three more times since then and here's what strikes me: For one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in "Forbidden Planet," which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!). You name it: warp drive, Captain/First Officer/Doctor triumvirate, babe in ultra-sexy outfits, beam down/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in "Forbidden Planet." The invisible id monster is truly horrifying when finally viewed. It looks like a serious rendition of the Tasmanian Devil. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this brief paragraph if you don't want to know the monster's true identity. The concept that the monster is, in reality, the personification of Dr. Morbius' lower subconscious nature (i.e. the id, "flesh" or carnal psyche) is a fascinating revelation. ***END SPOILER*** I wasn't at all expecting such mature commentary in a 50's sci-fi flick. Furthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is fascinating to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well. One thing that really blows me away every time I catch this flick, of course, is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira (or Alta for short), in her ultra skimpy (and cute) outfits. It doesn't matter what profound matters are going on in the film, if she's present in a scene with one of her various outfits, my eyes are completely focused on HER -- in utter awe of her jaw-dropping beauty. If you're a red-blooded male and think I'm kidding, check out the flick and see for yourself. I've heard some people complain about the scene where we are led to believe that Alta (Francis) is skinny-dipping, only to plainly observe that she's wearing a loose skin-colored bathing suit. Is this a cop-out on the film-maker's part because it was 1956? Not at all because the bathing suit is clearly visible once she steps out of the water. Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!). Please remember that "Forbidden Planet" is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come. GRADE: A

    For it's time, it was something special...a science fiction movie with a lavish MGM budget. The technical stuff is great and the composition of the landscape scenes are very good. I heard that preview audiences laughed at the final scenes where the "monster" was shown. They didn't change anything, evidently after the previews. It's a disappointment to see the evil monster as cartoon animation...even for audiences of the time. It's important to understand its place in the evolution of science fiction films as the next step was the far superior 2001: A Space Odyssey. I really think this movie is overrated. It has an interesting set design, the "music" gets on your nerves after a while, the plot plods along. The men lust after the woman, the woman lusts after the men...it's kind of a low budget story with a high budget for technical effects and sets. Think Queen of Outer Space or World Without End with a bigger budget. Yes, there's the whole ID part of the story and that makes it more "heady" but this film is really dull in many places. It isn't in the same league as Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Day the Earth Stood Still for 50s science fiction. The movie is worth seeing but I look forward to the remake.

    A star ship crew goes to investigate the silence of a planet's colony only to find two survivors and a deadly secret that one of them has. I love that this film was based on Shakespeare -- who would have ever thought such an English master could have inspired a science fiction film so legendary? Why was the moon landing in 2090 rather than 1969... and why does the new planet have coordinates based on north and west? Methinks the script was not fact-checked by people who actually knew science (of course, they did not know the moon landing was 1969 -- but to put it almost 150 years in the future seems absurd). Great effects for the time it was made, pretty much twenty years ahead of its time. Not only did it inspire "Star Trek", but the effects are on par with the original "Star Wars" in many ways.

    There is so much here that is buried fifty miles deep in post-war 1950's naivet&eacute; that it almost, but doesn't, ruin some of the great aspects that removes it from the low-budget contemporaries abundant in the time frame. A number of things that keep this from descending to dreary land is the impressive look of the whole thing. It is part Art-Deco, part pulp cover enchantment, and all 1950's kitsch and the new electronic sounds had quite a futuristic appeal. A great looking Flying Saucer navigates the stars and lands on a desolate Demon haunted world. It is the origin of the Demons that is at the heart of the complex story. The scenes of Krell technology and subterranean structures are awe inspiring and the unfolding of their History and knowledge keeps your interest. But, Robby the Robot notwithstanding, the comedy relief is anything but. It is so painfully dated and along with the crew behaving like the Big Red One, the script tries and almost succeeds in creating Camp. So, it is for the better, influential and rather amazing rest, that its shortfalls can be forgiven. Because the best is so powerful it zaps and blasts into irrelevance the peripheral pandering presented in such predictable Fifties conservatism and ethnocentrism. Note: The original poster for this Movie is one of the most sought after and expensive of its kind. It is, like this Movie, a Doozy.

    I went and saw this when it came out on the big screen, a Quaker Oats box top in my chubby little hands, heh heh. (Yes kiddies, you used to be able to see movies in a theater by just bringing proof you bought cereal, or a couple cans of veggies to help feed the needy. I will never forget the awe Forbidden Planet inspired in me at that early age, the dreams of traveling through space to distant planets. I'm sure it was the basis of my support for science and our quest for cost effective space exploration. Oh sure, young people today will undoubtedly have a hard time relating to fx of 60 years ago comparing to the cgi of today's movies. Perhaps a few might appreciate the hard work that went into choreographing blue screen acting with gel slide animation. And those fx were astoundingly produced in this one. I would hope younger people will try this out, just to help them appreciate the technology they enjoy today. Truly, the story is believable, without putting yourself out, so it is worth buying it on DVD for a nostalgic look into our scifi history. The Forbidden Planet, and The Day The Earth Stood Still led the way toward respectability in the Science Fiction genre...

    Yep, they were. Red leather, lovely 30's inspired decor, a minimum of screens & flashing lights. In fact I consider the minimalist layout to be much MORE hi-tech than the cluttered ships we usually see. Much of the dreary stuff is hidden from view. It makes the film seem quite modern (sort of). The Robinsons from "Lost in Space" shopped at the same Galactic Supa- Centre - they bought a scaled down ship, less expensive gear & a cheaper version of Robby but you can easily see the lineage. The special effects must have seemed pretty excellent back in the day because they still look good. Nice laser shots, the monster is well done, all in all they did a really good job. Sure, there are some holes in the plot but it isn't Shakespeare, it's a really good example of Science Fiction. Much, much better than I expected.

    'Forbidden Planet' is truly high among the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made, and later notable works such as 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars', etc. would be heavily influenced by it. With a story that enthralls the viewer with the wonders of Space, the VFX remain nothing less than astounding and wholly effective; its moody early-Electronica score further lends to the engrossing wonder, convincing the viewer on some deeper level that they're hearing what might be the celestial vibrations of our vast and infinite Universe. Based on William Shakespeare's 'The Tempest', 'Forbidden Planet' is a genuine cinematic and Science-Fiction masterpiece, one that ever continues to convey a sense of awe to this very day.

    Movie was released 5 yrs. before I was born, but still withstands the test of time. Robby The Robot and of course then still very enticing Ann Francis stole the show, still remember the sound of that motion sensor. How powerful was that Krill machine? I knew it could create images, but could it materialize solid objects as well, oh well, whatever, I remember Earl Holliman's character having Robby analyze that whiskey, and then Robby mass producing it for him. As for IMDb's Ann Francis biography describing her figure as voluptuous then women for years have been using the word incorrectly, because those who use the term to describe their physique are Full Figure (i.e.) chunky. Anne was actually 1 of the few back in those days that had a somewhat athletic figure, there were plenty of buxom blonde haired actresses, but firm figures none I am aware of other than Anne. Almost all leading cast deceased Walter Pidgeon, Warren Stevens, which by the way when he played Rojan in Classic Trek episode By Any Other Name he was already 48 almost Shatner's and Nimoy's senior by 11 yrs., Jack Kelly, Leslie Nielsen, and Anne Francis all deceased. Shame Anne chose not to pursue a more active acting career, true I do not find moles or birthmarks appealing, but with a figure like that just maybe I could see past it. What is it with some actresses they they seem to be oblivious to flaws that if removed or reconstructed they would be absolutely stunning. Consider Barbara Steisand and her nose as in being too big only a fool would say he is attracted to her because of her big nose. When I think of her it brings to mind a scene from the movie Funny Girl the 1 with her wearing that plunging neckline dress, hubba, hubba. As for Earl Holliman simply referred to as the Cook, he played Lt. Bill Crowley in Police Woman he will be 85 09/'13, Richard Anderson who played Oscar Goldman in the Six Million Dollar Man will be 87 in 08/'13. Did they not set the Krill machine to self destruct at the end in essence destroying the whole planet, oh well they saved the hot babe and the somewhat valuable piece of technology. J.J. Abrams could learn something by reviewing these classic Sci-Fi movies his Star Trek plots would not seem so much like something written by Alfred E. Newman.

    The plot of Forbidden Planet is so well known to most I won't go over it much here. I have to say that FP is certainly one of the two, or three best sci-fi films of the 1950s. It Came from Outer Space and This Island Earth are two more which a strong argument for being "the best" can be made. True enough, some of the effects are a bit on the hokey side by modern standards, but this was 1956, after all, remember. It is good to have some examples of Leslie Nielsen playing serious roles around, and this film is one of his best. I do think some of the dialog is a bit too much like a World War Two film at times, but WW II was only eleven years in the past when Forbidden Planet was produced. And like most, I cold have done as well without the comedy of Earl Holliman's cook character - I can understand why the movie isn't one of his favorites, for this was a thankless role. I also was knocked out by Anne Francis like every other male who's ever seen this film, even if she perhaps a bit too old for portraying a twenty-year old. She has a number of genre credits, including two classic appearances on the original Twilight Zone, by the way. Some have complained of the fact that cruiser C-57-D was a flying saucer(the first ever shown with a human crew, I believe), but the 1950s was the heyday of UFOs - the ship does fine to me. I do feel the preaching at the end was a bit corny perhaps by modern standards; movie audiences of the period were generally much more of the "there are some things man(or here, Krell) were not meant to know" school of thinking, as were most scriptwriters, of course. Not much else to add save that Robby the Robot remains probably the best film robot to date - he appeared on the Twilight Zone as well as numerous other TV shows at least into the 1970s, including Wonder Woman, I believe. For those interested in novelizations, one was published in '56 as Forbidden Planet by W.J. Stuart, at a time when this wasn't often done.

    "Forbidden Planet" has a lot of the elements of corny '50s sci-fi movies. It shows off its special effects in masturbatory fashion, features a robot, loads the dialogue up with esoteric science babble and portrays its one female character in misogynistic fashion (oh wait, that's all '50s movies). But "Forbidden Planet" doesn't simply trying to cash in on fans of "Flash Gordon" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still." Buried beneath it all is an ideal mystery plot with an intelligent payoff. The film follows a space crew investigating the sudden silence on Altair IV. Upon landing which they were warned not to dothey discover only Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) have survived (and let's not forget Robby the Robot). The intrepid Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen), Doc (Warren Stevens) and the playboy Lt. Farman (Jack Kelly) investigate and find that Morbius is hiding something from them. "Forbidden Planet" is a special effects showcase, sometimes to a fault as scenes are designed almost exclusively around the movie magic, but compare it with the excessive CGI carnage of today's blockbusters and it's not something of which you can be all that critical.

Sure, there are some holes in the plot but it isn't Shakespeare, it's a really good example of Science Fiction. Much, much better than I expected.

    'Forbidden Planet' is truly high among the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made, and later notable works such as 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars', etc. would be heavily influenced by it. With a story that enthralls the viewer with the wonders of Space, the VFX remain nothing less than astounding and wholly effective; its moody early-Electronica score further lends to the engrossing wonder, convincing the viewer on some deeper level that they're hearing what might be the celestial vibrations of our vast and infinite Universe. Based on William Shakespeare's 'The Tempest', 'Forbidden Planet' is a genuine cinematic and Science-Fiction masterpiece, one that ever continues to convey a sense of awe to this very day.

    Movie was released 5 yrs. before I was born, but still withstands the test of time. Robby The Robot and of course then still very enticing Ann Francis stole the show, still remember the sound of that motion sensor. How powerful was that Krill machine? I knew it could create images, but could it materialize solid objects as well, oh well, whatever, I remember Earl Holliman's character having Robby analyze that whiskey, and then Robby mass producing it for him. As for IMDb's Ann Francis biography describing her figure as voluptuous then women for years have been using the word incorrectly, because those who use the term to describe their physique are Full Figure (i.e.) chunky. Anne was actually 1 of the few back in those days that had a somewhat athletic figure, there were plenty of buxom blonde haired actresses, but firm figures none I am aware of other than Anne. Almost all leading cast deceased Walter Pidgeon, Warren Stevens, which by the way when he played Rojan in Classic Trek episode By Any Other Name he was already 48 almost Shatner's and Nimoy's senior by 11 yrs., Jack Kelly, Leslie Nielsen, and Anne Francis all deceased. Shame Anne chose not to pursue a more active acting career, true I do not find moles or birthmarks appealing, but with a figure like that just maybe I could see past it. What is it with some actresses they they seem to be oblivious to flaws that if removed or reconstructed they would be absolutely stunning. Consider Barbara Steisand and her nose as in being too big only a fool would say he is attracted to her because of her big nose. When I think of her it brings to mind a scene from the movie Funny Girl the 1 with her wearing that plunging neckline dress, hubba, hubba. As for Earl Holliman simply referred to as the Cook, he played Lt. Bill Crowley in Police Woman he will be 85 09/'13, Richard Anderson who played Oscar Goldman in the Six Million Dollar Man will be 87 in 08/'13. Did they not set the Krill machine to self destruct at the end in essence destroying the whole planet, oh well they saved the hot babe and the somewhat valuable piece of technology. J.J. Abrams could learn something by reviewing these classic Sci-Fi movies his Star Trek plots would not seem so much like something written by Alfred E. Newman.

    The plot of Forbidden Planet is so well known to most I won't go over it much here. I have to say that FP is certainly one of the two, or three best sci-fi films of the 1950s. It Came from Outer Space and This Island Earth are two more which a strong argument for being "the best" can be made. True enough, some of the effects are a bit on the hokey side by modern standards, but this was 1956, after all, remember. It is good to have some examples of Leslie Nielsen playing serious roles around, and this film is one of his best. I do think some of the dialog is a bit too much like a World War Two film at times, but WW II was only eleven years in the past when Forbidden Planet was produced. And like most, I cold have done as well without the comedy of Earl Holliman's cook character - I can understand why the movie isn't one of his favorites, for this was a thankless role. I also was knocked out by Anne Francis like every other male who's ever seen this film, even if she perhaps a bit too old for portraying a twenty-year old. She has a number of genre credits, including two classic appearances on the original Twilight Zone, by the way. Some have complained of the fact that cruiser C-57-D was a flying saucer(the first ever shown with a human crew, I believe), but the 1950s was the heyday of UFOs - the ship does fine to me. I do feel the preaching at the end was a bit corny perhaps by modern standards; movie audiences of the period were generally much more of the "there are some things man(or here, Krell) were not meant to know" school of thinking, as were most scriptwriters, of course. Not much else to add save that Robby the Robot remains probably the best film robot to date - he appeared on the Twilight Zone as well as numerous other TV shows at least into the 1970s, including Wonder Woman, I believe. For those interested in novelizations, one was published in '56 as Forbidden Planet by W.J. Stuart, at a time when this wasn't often done.

    "Forbidden Planet" has a lot of the elements of corny '50s sci-fi movies. It shows off its special effects in masturbatory fashion, features a robot, loads the dialogue up with esoteric science babble and portrays its one female character in misogynistic fashion (oh wait, that's all '50s movies). But "Forbidden Planet" doesn't simply trying to cash in on fans of "Flash Gordon" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still." Buried beneath it all is an ideal mystery plot with an intelligent payoff. The film follows a space crew investigating the sudden silence on Altair IV. Upon landing which they were warned not to dothey discover only Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) have survived (and let's not forget Robby the Robot). The intrepid Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen), Doc (Warren Stevens) and the playboy Lt. Farman (Jack Kelly) investigate and find that Morbius is hiding something from them. "Forbidden Planet" is a special effects showcase, sometimes to a fault as scenes are designed almost exclusively around the movie magic, but compare it with the excessive CGI carnage of today's blockbusters and it's not something of which you can be all that critical. Besides, the weapon design, costume design and set design are all cohesive and tasteful, and in some cases marvelous. The plot does take a long time to get somewhere. A lot of the plot gets lost in writer Cyril Hume's aforementioned display of gadgetry and in the romantic subplot between Altaira and just about everyone else, but it ends up being worth the wait. The mystery at the heart of the film doesn't have an contemporary counterparts, and most films targeted at a genre audience like this one don't sneak in powerful human themes. No doubt Hume honored Irving Block and Allen Adler's "Twilight Zone"-esque story in doing so. In terms of acting, Pidgeon, playing Morbius, the man who keeps that secret, sells us with his passionate performance, especially at the end. Like all great sci fi, "Forbidden Planet" also plays with the notion of what's unseen. Perhaps Ridley Scott took some notes from director Fred M. Wilcox when he made "Alien," because the film hints at a frightening beast that it never shows and manages to wield a lot of suspense doing so. And you know it's legit, because clearly special effects and even makeup were not convincing enough in the mid-'50s to deliver a powerful creature reveal. Even though what comes you know won't measure up to your imagination, Wilcox has your imagination working, and that's the key. Also, the film's electronic soundtrack (eons ahead of its time) has to get a lot of credit (especially for the suspense part). You expect the usual cheesy suspense strings in '50s films, but "Forbidden Planet" retains an aura of mystery to this day I think in large part to a score that doesn't telegraphic any of the plot's moves. Although long stretches can be disengaging, and everything surrounding Altaira is pretty stupid, "Forbidden Planet" has its place in the canon of influential science-fiction movies. When you consider that the film's producers probably just wanted to make "an outer space picture," the end result is more than we could ask for. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    Released in 1956, I didn't see "Forbidden Planet" until a full 40 years later. I've seen it three more times since then and here's what strikes me: For one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in "Forbidden Planet," which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!). You name it: warp drive, Captain/First Officer/Doctor triumvirate, babe in ultra-sexy outfits, beam down/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in "Forbidden Planet." The invisible id monster is truly horrifying when finally viewed. It looks like a serious rendition of the Tasmanian Devil. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this brief paragraph if you don't want to know the monster's true identity. The concept that the monster is, in reality, the personification of Dr. Morbius' lower subconscious nature (i.e. the id, "flesh" or carnal psyche) is a fascinating revelation. ***END SPOILER*** I wasn't at all expecting such mature commentary in a 50's sci-fi flick. Furthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is fascinating to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well. One thing that really blows me away every time I catch this flick, of course, is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira (or Alta for short), in her ultra skimpy (and cute) outfits. It doesn't matter what profound matters are going on in the film, if she's present in a scene with one of her various outfits, my eyes are completely focused on HER -- in utter awe of her jaw-dropping beauty. If you're a red-blooded male and think I'm kidding, check out the flick and see for yourself. I've heard some people complain about the scene where we are led to believe that Alta (Francis) is skinny-dipping, only to plainly observe that she's wearing a loose skin-colored bathing suit. Is this a cop-out on the film-maker's part because it was 1956? Not at all because the bathing suit is clearly visible once she steps out of the water. Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!). Please remember that "Forbidden Planet" is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come. GRADE: A

    For it's time, it was something special...a science fiction movie with a lavish MGM budget. The technical stuff is great and the composition of the landscape scenes are very good. I heard that preview audiences laughed at the final scenes where the "monster" was shown. They didn't change anything, evidently after the previews. It's a disappointment to see the evil monster as cartoon animation...even for audiences of the time. It's important to understand its place in the evolution of science fiction films as the next step was the far superior 2001: A Space Odyssey. I really think this movie is overrated. It has an interesting set design, the "music" gets on your nerves after a while, the plot plods along. The men lust after the woman, the woman lusts after the men...it's kind of a low budget story with a high budget for technical effects and sets. Think Queen of Outer Space or World Without End with a bigger budget. Yes, there's the whole ID part of the story and that makes it more "heady" but this film is really dull in many places. It isn't in the same league as Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Day the Earth Stood Still for 50s science fiction. The movie is worth seeing but I look forward to the remake.

    A star ship crew goes to investigate the silence of a planet's colony only to find two survivors and a deadly secret that one of them has. I love that this film was based on Shakespeare -- who would have ever thought such an English master could have inspired a science fiction film so legendary? Why was the moon landing in 2090 rather than 1969... and why does the new planet have coordinates based on north and west? Methinks the script was not fact-checked by people who actually knew science (of course, they did not know the moon landing was 1969 -- but to put it almost 150 years in the future seems absurd). Great effects for the time it was made, pretty much twenty years ahead of its time. Not only did it inspire "Star Trek", but the effects are on par with the original "Star Wars" in many ways.

    There is so much here that is buried fifty miles deep in post-war 1950's naivet&eacute; that it almost, but doesn't, ruin some of the great aspects that removes it from the low-budget contemporaries abundant in the time frame. A number of things that keep this from descending to dreary land is the impressive look of the whole thing. It is part Art-Deco, part pulp cover enchantment, and all 1950's kitsch and the new electronic sounds had quite a futuristic appeal. A great looking Flying Saucer navigates the stars and lands on a desolate Demon haunted world. It is the origin of the Demons that is at the heart of the complex story. The scenes of Krell technology and subterranean structures are awe inspiring and the unfolding of their History and knowledge keeps your interest. But, Robby the Robot notwithstanding, the comedy relief is anything but. It is so painfully dated and along with the crew behaving like the Big Red One, the script tries and almost succeeds in creating Camp. So, it is for the better, influential and rather amazing rest, that its shortfalls can be forgiven. Because the best is so powerful it zaps and blasts into irrelevance the peripheral pandering presented in such predictable Fifties conservatism and ethnocentrism. Note: The original poster for this Movie is one of the most sought after and expensive of its kind. It is, like this Movie, a Doozy.

    I went and saw this when it came out on the big screen, a Quaker Oats box top in my chubby little hands, heh heh. (Yes kiddies, you used to be able to see movies in a theater by just bringing proof you bought cereal, or a couple cans of veggies to help feed the needy. I will never forget the awe Forbidden Planet inspired in me at that early age, the dreams of traveling through space to distant planets. I'm sure it was the basis of my support for science and our quest for cost effective space exploration. Oh sure, young people today will undoubtedly have a hard time relating to fx of 60 years ago comparing to the cgi of today's movies. Perhaps a few might appreciate the hard work that went into choreographing blue screen acting with gel slide animation. And those fx were astoundingly produced in this one. I would hope younger people will try this out, just to help them appreciate the technology they enjoy today. Truly, the story is believable, without putting yourself out, so it is worth buying it on DVD for a nostalgic look into our scifi history. The Forbidden Planet, and The Day The Earth Stood Still led the way toward respectability in the Science Fiction genre...

    Yep, they were. Red leather, lovely 30's inspired decor, a minimum of screens & flashing lights. In fact I consider the minimalist layout to be much MORE hi-tech than the cluttered ships we usually see. Much of the dreary stuff is hidden from view. It makes the film seem quite modern (sort of). The Robinsons from "Lost in Space" shopped at the same Galactic Supa- Centre - they bought a scaled down ship, less expensive gear & a cheaper version of Robby but you can easily see the lineage. The special effects must have seemed pretty excellent back in the day because they still look good. Nice laser shots, the monster is well done, all in all they did a really good job. Sure, there are some holes in the plot but it isn't Shakespeare, it's a really good example of Science Fiction. Much, much better than I expected.

Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!). Please remember that "Forbidden Planet" is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come. GRADE: A

    For it's time, it was something special...a science fiction movie with a lavish MGM budget. The technical stuff is great and the composition of the landscape scenes are very good. I heard that preview audiences laughed at the final scenes where the "monster" was shown. They didn't change anything, evidently after the previews. It's a disappointment to see the evil monster as cartoon animation...even for audiences of the time. It's important to understand its place in the evolution of science fiction films as the next step was the far superior 2001: A Space Odyssey. I really think this movie is overrated. It has an interesting set design, the "music" gets on your nerves after a while, the plot plods along. The men lust after the woman, the woman lusts after the men...it's kind of a low budget story with a high budget for technical effects and sets. Think Queen of Outer Space or World Without End with a bigger budget. Yes, there's the whole ID part of the story and that makes it more "heady" but this film is really dull in many places. It isn't in the same league as Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Day the Earth Stood Still for 50s science fiction. The movie is worth seeing but I look forward to the remake.

    A star ship crew goes to investigate the silence of a planet's colony only to find two survivors and a deadly secret that one of them has. I love that this film was based on Shakespeare -- who would have ever thought such an English master could have inspired a science fiction film so legendary? Why was the moon landing in 2090 rather than 1969... and why does the new planet have coordinates based on north and west? Methinks the script was not fact-checked by people who actually knew science (of course, they did not know the moon landing was 1969 -- but to put it almost 150 years in the future seems absurd). Great effects for the time it was made, pretty much twenty years ahead of its time. Not only did it inspire "Star Trek", but the effects are on par with the original "Star Wars" in many ways.

    There is so much here that is buried fifty miles deep in post-war 1950's naivet&eacute; that it almost, but doesn't, ruin some of the great aspects that removes it from the low-budget contemporaries abundant in the time frame. A number of things that keep this from descending to dreary land is the impressive look of the whole thing. It is part Art-Deco, part pulp cover enchantment, and all 1950's kitsch and the new electronic sounds had quite a futuristic appeal. A great looking Flying Saucer navigates the stars and lands on a desolate Demon haunted world. It is the origin of the Demons that is at the heart of the complex story. The scenes of Krell technology and subterranean structures are awe inspiring and the unfolding of their History and knowledge keeps your interest. But, Robby the Robot notwithstanding, the comedy relief is anything but. It is so painfully dated and along with the crew behaving like the Big Red One, the script tries and almost succeeds in creating Camp. So, it is for the better, influential and rather amazing rest, that its shortfalls can be forgiven. Because the best is so powerful it zaps and blasts into irrelevance the peripheral pandering presented in such predictable Fifties conservatism and ethnocentrism. Note: The original poster for this Movie is one of the most sought after and expensive of its kind. It is, like this Movie, a Doozy.

    I went and saw this when it came out on the big screen, a Quaker Oats box top in my chubby little hands, heh heh. (Yes kiddies, you used to be able to see movies in a theater by just bringing proof you bought cereal, or a couple cans of veggies to help feed the needy. I will never forget the awe Forbidden Planet inspired in me at that early age, the dreams of traveling through space to distant planets. I'm sure it was the basis of my support for science and our quest for cost effective space exploration. Oh sure, young people today will undoubtedly have a hard time relating to fx of 60 years ago comparing to the cgi of today's movies. Perhaps a few might appreciate the hard work that went into choreographing blue screen acting with gel slide animation. And those fx were astoundingly produced in this one. I would hope younger people will try this out, just to help them appreciate the technology they enjoy today. Truly, the story is believable, without putting yourself out, so it is worth buying it on DVD for a nostalgic look into our scifi history. The Forbidden Planet, and The Day The Earth Stood Still led the way toward respectability in the Science Fiction genre...
