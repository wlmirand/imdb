    Hard to understand. Its an "R" rated movie but its written for children, or maybe the problem is that it was directed and produced for children, whatever the case as an adult watching the movie is awkward. I'm not developmentally delayed so the child-like humor and wit of the movie is like drinking sulfuric acid, I mean Lori Petty's acting and delivery causes real pain. Some cut-scenes show the comics this movie is adapted from and those scenes are intriguing those scenes are vivid glowing things- and when you think that its merely comic book art stills, y'know, motionless movie frames then compare it to the actual motion picture, its clear that the drawings are the best parts. Everything sucks, the lighting the acting the costumes the sets, but raise a glass to Naomi Watts, she can actually act and is gorgeous as a brunette.

    First thing's first: the film's opening credits montage is pretty darn cool. With the rock music and the flashing comic-book images, I was lured in with the promise of a truly punk-spirited post-apocalypse adventure. Well, the film delivers, in the sense that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and there's adventure. This is also a very wacky film, with cartoony comic relief, cheesy action, and a very cheap production value. The good thing about this film is that the main character's attitude is so wild and fun that accentuates the goofy nature of the film, and delivers the punkish vibe I was expecting. Everything else, however, tends to be rather ridiculous. It makes for a weirdly mixed experience overall. This story is pretty basic stuff, lacking in depth or emotion. The plot wanders all over the place, lacking in specific direction. Chances are that you've seen better structure and deeper meaning in other great sci-fi films that bear all the same plot elements and characters. Tank Girl squanders its storytelling potential in favor of just being kooky. This film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Comic book images are cut in at various places. A couple of scenes are animated, and those are probably the coolest parts. Acting is extremely cheesy and over-the-top; Lori Petty uses such cheese to craft an deliciously fun and hip performance, while a very young Naomi Watts plays a perfect square, and Malcolm McDowell does his usual schtick. Writing is pretty simple-minded. This production has sets, props, and costumes that are so cheap-looking, colorful, and clean; the film almost looks like what you'd get if Pee Wee Herman's playhouse survived the apocalypse and went just slightly feral. Music is alright; the score is okay, and a number of good songs are used to give the film a little more oomph to the punk factor. Much like the actual tank in the film, Tank Girl is a cheap-looking, colorful, gaudy, haphazard assortment of random parts and cute decor. It's definitely cheesy, but it is pretty fun that way regardless. I'd say it's perfectly fitting next to other weird, cheap, and cheesy flicks like the Super Mario Bros movie, or Howard the Duck. If those appeal to you, then Tank Girl might be up your alley. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Poor | Film: Poor)

    I am not sure why I even purchased this particular film. Maybe it had something to do with the belief that it may have been a cult classic, but seriously, it is not. I remember some friends watching it and raving about it, but then again those friends have long gone, and I rarely, if ever, see them around. Maybe another group of friends liked this movie, but who they were I really have no memory of because the group of friends that I hung around in later years of my university life really did not seem to watch many movies. Basically this is a post-apocalyptic film set after a comet destroys the Earth and the planet is ruled by a megacorporation known as Water and Power. Basically they control all of the water and have all of the power (as Tank Girl explains at the beginning) but in reality, all this corporation seems to be is one executives and a bunch of soldiers with slaves and prisoners doing all of the other work. Then there are the reavers, some creatures that come out at night, live underground, and cause havoc to the corporation, and finally, there is everybody else, namely those who live out in the desert and attempt to escape the clutches of Water & Power. To me this seems to reflect the nineties struggle between Generation X and the baby boomers, with Generation X wanting to have fun, and not to pay for it, and the Baby Boomers seeking to stifle the limits of that fun. Basically the baby boomers control the means by which Generation X can enjoy themselves, though we should be mindful of the fact that it was the Baby Boomers that led the sexual revolution of the late 60s. However, as one friend pointed out, the protesters of the 60s are the corporate bosses of the 90s. However, even now we see this idea of giving the young much more power than they really know how to use (not that the baby boomers know how to use it either). I guess this film catches the essence of the 90s (not only with the grunge rock sound track). We had come out victorious from the Cold War, and it was still years away from the modern era of the Islamic terrorist and the new McCarthyism that arose under the Bush administration. We see the younger generation, as defined by Tank Girl, moving further away from the traditional roots that many of the baby boomers grew up with, and also rejecting the baby boomer's morality. However we are also seeing the beginning of the rise of the megacorporations, and the tight hold that they have on our lives. This era was also an era dominated by consolidation, as the small businesses disappear to be replaced by the big box outlets outside of town, as is represented by Walmart in America. The multitude of various companies are replaced by one single overarching company, as is seen in Australia where once we had three airline carriers, and now only have one. The same is the case with the supermarkets, which have all come under two major companies, with a collection of independent stores a distant third. Take a look on Google Maps of the various towns in the United States, where main street has all but disappeared to be replaced by shopping malls, big box outlets, and chains upon chains of fast food restaurants. This is the new world that we have entered and are struggling to survive in, in the same way that Tank Girl struggles to survive in a world dominated by Water and Power. As for the film itself, well, it is silly. In fact, it is not amusing or enjoyable silly, it is just silly. For instance, the scene where she is chasing the truck is just simply pathetic, especially where they have one shot of her cooking a barbecue on the top of her tank. To me that was not only a WOF moment, it was a roll my eyes, I can't believe this film, type of moment. As for me, I'm off to see This is the End.

    This movie probably would have worked a lot better as an animated film, and a lot of the actors did do some voice work for the DC Animated Universe. The inadequacies of the live action are hit on when they intersplice panels or animation from the actual comic. So the world ends and all the water vanishes, except that controlled by Water and Power, led by Generic Evil Guy, Malcolm McDowell. Petty is actually pretty good in the film, but this film probably killed her career. Ice-T was in this film, and sadly didn't suffer career adversity. The action scenes are okay. The comedy kind of works. I give them credit for making it, because frankly, given the awfulness that often comes out of the Hollywood assembly line is so banal.

While incarcerated at W + P, Tank Girl and her new friend Jet Girl break out and steal... a tank and a jet. After meeting some mutant kangaroo/humans, and rescuing her little girl (adopted by her friends), the kangaroos and the girls turn on Water and Power..... It seemed like a good idea at the time, i'm sure someone said soon after the figures came in. I was all for this movie, I thought the comic was far out, and the inclusion of Petty and Macdowell were good choices. The overall product, feels a lot like the Van Damme movie Cyborg, with a little bit of Howard the Duck thrown in for good measure. To some people this is very bad, to others, it;s a sign of something quirky, something that draws you back, no matter how many times you have seen the film. I saw it at the cinema, thought it was awful, brought the VHS and thought it was awful. I've just seen it again, knowing that the film was awful, and I've enjoyed it a lot more. The story is poor, and the inclusion of the comic being shown every couple of minutes grates rather than endears, but there is value to it. The rippers look good, and Macdowell is hamming it up more than he ever did in Star Trek: Generations. And Petty really puts in a good performance as the titular character. There's no doubt i'll see this again in about seven years.

    I had heard this was a cult classic & I usually enjoy those type of movies. From the description it sounded like my type of movie. Though there were some elements that I really liked, for the most part I was let down. I love the animated comic book sequences. Those alone were almost enough to rescue the movie. However, the visuals were not as stunning as I expected. Maybe its because it's an old 90's movie, but the the ships looked they were made of cardboard, the Rippers were incredibly cheesy costumes, etc. The plot felt like something I've seen before. Goofy & overly mean villain is holding the poor masses hostage & one of the peons rises to take him down. I felt like "Rebecca" was a really fun character for Lori Petty, but I thought she was kind of stupid, mumbling weird things all throughout the movie. There seemed to me a lot of disjointed imagery and side events that confused the main focus of the movie. Lastly..."Tank Girl" rarely ever even drove her tank!

    Tank Girl is based in the year 2033 when all water and power are run by an evil dictator Kesslee, played by Malcom Mcdowell. Living on the edge and stealing water Tank Girl and her home is attacked taking her prisoner and the little girl, Sam, as well. Tank Girl, played by Lori Petti, mets the unrecognizable, Naomi Watts, who plays Jet. The two team up to rescue the young Sam and defeat Kesslee. Along the way she finds a tank that follows her like a puppy, and a gang known as the Rippers who are part Kangaroo DNA part human who also want to defeat Mcdowell. The movie is amazing, I used to watch it with my grandfather when I was younger, and just recently watched it again when I found it on Netflix. The film has everything you want. A love story (between the Ripper name Booga and Tank Girl), action, and a musical number. The plot of the movie is different which makes me like the movie so much more. It was not a remake, it has its own twist and turns on good vs. evil. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a lot of fun to watch.

    I love this the way I love Wayne's World, the Beastie Boys, and the concept of Catwoman. It's goofy/lovable, quick-witted/smart, and it's some sort of honest exploration of women as ruthless survivors (though it sounds like the comic books did a better job than the movie). Comic book adaptations today seem to be all about the special effects and having enormous balls. The female characters are sometimes more than one dimensional, but are probably not much fun to hang out with, especially during an apocalypse. Yes, I would want to hang out with Lara Croft during an apocalypse, but there you have it, the two leading roles played by women in action movies, the badass/serious/sexy and the damsel/maybe-smart-but-defenseless/sexy, so at least this movie has value in the fact that there are very few action movies with female leads in this sort of role. And the music, unhhh.....throwback whiplash. The Portishead and Bjork scenes especially. Yes. I should emphasize how campy this movie is in case anyone is expecting anything else.

    First of all, let me be clear that not everyone will like this movie. I know a number of people who just do not like fantasy or silliness in movies. If you are one of those serious people, this movie is not for you. But if you are open minded and say - hey just show me something fun and silly that may not have any reality, then this could be your movie. It also however, does have some R rated sections for both violence and sexiness. I also believe that movies should be rated on what they claim to be. This movie certainly is not "Gone with the Wind", but then again, it does not claim to be. It claims to be a silly movie about a comic book heroine that is merely trying to be entertaining - assuming one likes that genre in the first place. To a certain extent, this movie reminded me a bit of a more modern version of Jane Fonda's Barbarella - a movie also made with a sexy most odd female in an odd sci-fi world. If you liked Barbarella or the silly movie Mars Attacks, you might like this one as well. As for me, I rated this movie somewhat high based on that I think it did what it promised to do - be a silly, entertaining comedy. I also find it has an odd attraction. Again, this movie is not for everyone. But for some of us, was entertaining for 90 minutes or so.

    That is my opinion of course. I noticed before sitting down to watch Tank Girl that it has got a bad reputation for being a Hollywoodised bastardisation of the cult comic. As someone who has a lot of fondness for the comic and as an admirer of Malcolm McDowell, I found Tank Girl neither a good or terrible movie. More the disappointing but sort of watchable neck of the woods. I do give it plaudits for the colourful visuals, the upbeat soundtrack and decent performances from most of the cast. Lori Petty does have some cringe-worthy one-liners but I did find her surprisingly credible, and while Ice-T has some irritating moments he has moments where he is also fun. The best performances however come from Naomi Watts and especially Malcolm McDowell who is over-the-top but in an enjoyable way. However, the script is pretty awful. The one-liners are enough to make you cringe, the humour is stale and it also lacked the sassy black-humoured feel of the comic. The story has a great concept but for me suffered from being too unevenly paced(mostly rushed) and predictable with many moments of dumbness, a couple of limply paced scenes such as the musical scene at the Rippers' base and a few too many moments where it steers off track. Characters are a mixed bag. Tank Girl and Kesslee are fun enough, but Jet and Sub Girls are not as interesting personality-wise as they were in the comics and the Rippers more often than not are annoying. Another big disappointment is the direction, which is flashy but also too muddled, never knowing whether it is trying to handle a satire, comedy or futuristic action. Consequently the black, sassy humour could have benefited the satire and the comedy, but seeing as they were missing the humour to me seemed flat, and the more action-like parts looked clunky. Overall, I was willing to judge it on its own terms and to form my own opinion, but while I don't think Tank Girl is as bad as people say and I have seen far worse movies there wasn't really anything especially outstanding about it. 4/10 Bethany Cox

Maybe its because it's an old 90's movie, but the the ships looked they were made of cardboard, the Rippers were incredibly cheesy costumes, etc. The plot felt like something I've seen before. Goofy & overly mean villain is holding the poor masses hostage & one of the peons rises to take him down. I felt like "Rebecca" was a really fun character for Lori Petty, but I thought she was kind of stupid, mumbling weird things all throughout the movie. There seemed to me a lot of disjointed imagery and side events that confused the main focus of the movie. Lastly..."Tank Girl" rarely ever even drove her tank!

    Tank Girl is based in the year 2033 when all water and power are run by an evil dictator Kesslee, played by Malcom Mcdowell. Living on the edge and stealing water Tank Girl and her home is attacked taking her prisoner and the little girl, Sam, as well. Tank Girl, played by Lori Petti, mets the unrecognizable, Naomi Watts, who plays Jet. The two team up to rescue the young Sam and defeat Kesslee. Along the way she finds a tank that follows her like a puppy, and a gang known as the Rippers who are part Kangaroo DNA part human who also want to defeat Mcdowell. The movie is amazing, I used to watch it with my grandfather when I was younger, and just recently watched it again when I found it on Netflix. The film has everything you want. A love story (between the Ripper name Booga and Tank Girl), action, and a musical number. The plot of the movie is different which makes me like the movie so much more. It was not a remake, it has its own twist and turns on good vs. evil. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a lot of fun to watch.

    I love this the way I love Wayne's World, the Beastie Boys, and the concept of Catwoman. It's goofy/lovable, quick-witted/smart, and it's some sort of honest exploration of women as ruthless survivors (though it sounds like the comic books did a better job than the movie). Comic book adaptations today seem to be all about the special effects and having enormous balls. The female characters are sometimes more than one dimensional, but are probably not much fun to hang out with, especially during an apocalypse. Yes, I would want to hang out with Lara Croft during an apocalypse, but there you have it, the two leading roles played by women in action movies, the badass/serious/sexy and the damsel/maybe-smart-but-defenseless/sexy, so at least this movie has value in the fact that there are very few action movies with female leads in this sort of role. And the music, unhhh.....throwback whiplash. The Portishead and Bjork scenes especially. Yes. I should emphasize how campy this movie is in case anyone is expecting anything else.

    First of all, let me be clear that not everyone will like this movie. I know a number of people who just do not like fantasy or silliness in movies. If you are one of those serious people, this movie is not for you. But if you are open minded and say - hey just show me something fun and silly that may not have any reality, then this could be your movie. It also however, does have some R rated sections for both violence and sexiness. I also believe that movies should be rated on what they claim to be. This movie certainly is not "Gone with the Wind", but then again, it does not claim to be. It claims to be a silly movie about a comic book heroine that is merely trying to be entertaining - assuming one likes that genre in the first place. To a certain extent, this movie reminded me a bit of a more modern version of Jane Fonda's Barbarella - a movie also made with a sexy most odd female in an odd sci-fi world. If you liked Barbarella or the silly movie Mars Attacks, you might like this one as well. As for me, I rated this movie somewhat high based on that I think it did what it promised to do - be a silly, entertaining comedy. I also find it has an odd attraction. Again, this movie is not for everyone. But for some of us, was entertaining for 90 minutes or so.

    That is my opinion of course. I noticed before sitting down to watch Tank Girl that it has got a bad reputation for being a Hollywoodised bastardisation of the cult comic. As someone who has a lot of fondness for the comic and as an admirer of Malcolm McDowell, I found Tank Girl neither a good or terrible movie. More the disappointing but sort of watchable neck of the woods. I do give it plaudits for the colourful visuals, the upbeat soundtrack and decent performances from most of the cast. Lori Petty does have some cringe-worthy one-liners but I did find her surprisingly credible, and while Ice-T has some irritating moments he has moments where he is also fun. The best performances however come from Naomi Watts and especially Malcolm McDowell who is over-the-top but in an enjoyable way. However, the script is pretty awful. The one-liners are enough to make you cringe, the humour is stale and it also lacked the sassy black-humoured feel of the comic. The story has a great concept but for me suffered from being too unevenly paced(mostly rushed) and predictable with many moments of dumbness, a couple of limply paced scenes such as the musical scene at the Rippers' base and a few too many moments where it steers off track. Characters are a mixed bag. Tank Girl and Kesslee are fun enough, but Jet and Sub Girls are not as interesting personality-wise as they were in the comics and the Rippers more often than not are annoying. Another big disappointment is the direction, which is flashy but also too muddled, never knowing whether it is trying to handle a satire, comedy or futuristic action. Consequently the black, sassy humour could have benefited the satire and the comedy, but seeing as they were missing the humour to me seemed flat, and the more action-like parts looked clunky. Overall, I was willing to judge it on its own terms and to form my own opinion, but while I don't think Tank Girl is as bad as people say and I have seen far worse movies there wasn't really anything especially outstanding about it. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    Hard to understand. Its an "R" rated movie but its written for children, or maybe the problem is that it was directed and produced for children, whatever the case as an adult watching the movie is awkward. I'm not developmentally delayed so the child-like humor and wit of the movie is like drinking sulfuric acid, I mean Lori Petty's acting and delivery causes real pain. Some cut-scenes show the comics this movie is adapted from and those scenes are intriguing those scenes are vivid glowing things- and when you think that its merely comic book art stills, y'know, motionless movie frames then compare it to the actual motion picture, its clear that the drawings are the best parts. Everything sucks, the lighting the acting the costumes the sets, but raise a glass to Naomi Watts, she can actually act and is gorgeous as a brunette.

    First thing's first: the film's opening credits montage is pretty darn cool. With the rock music and the flashing comic-book images, I was lured in with the promise of a truly punk-spirited post-apocalypse adventure. Well, the film delivers, in the sense that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and there's adventure. This is also a very wacky film, with cartoony comic relief, cheesy action, and a very cheap production value. The good thing about this film is that the main character's attitude is so wild and fun that accentuates the goofy nature of the film, and delivers the punkish vibe I was expecting. Everything else, however, tends to be rather ridiculous. It makes for a weirdly mixed experience overall. This story is pretty basic stuff, lacking in depth or emotion. The plot wanders all over the place, lacking in specific direction. Chances are that you've seen better structure and deeper meaning in other great sci-fi films that bear all the same plot elements and characters. Tank Girl squanders its storytelling potential in favor of just being kooky. This film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Comic book images are cut in at various places. A couple of scenes are animated, and those are probably the coolest parts. Acting is extremely cheesy and over-the-top; Lori Petty uses such cheese to craft an deliciously fun and hip performance, while a very young Naomi Watts plays a perfect square, and Malcolm McDowell does his usual schtick. Writing is pretty simple-minded. This production has sets, props, and costumes that are so cheap-looking, colorful, and clean; the film almost looks like what you'd get if Pee Wee Herman's playhouse survived the apocalypse and went just slightly feral. Music is alright; the score is okay, and a number of good songs are used to give the film a little more oomph to the punk factor. Much like the actual tank in the film, Tank Girl is a cheap-looking, colorful, gaudy, haphazard assortment of random parts and cute decor. It's definitely cheesy, but it is pretty fun that way regardless. I'd say it's perfectly fitting next to other weird, cheap, and cheesy flicks like the Super Mario Bros movie, or Howard the Duck. If those appeal to you, then Tank Girl might be up your alley. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Poor | Film: Poor)

    I am not sure why I even purchased this particular film. Maybe it had something to do with the belief that it may have been a cult classic, but seriously, it is not. I remember some friends watching it and raving about it, but then again those friends have long gone, and I rarely, if ever, see them around. Maybe another group of friends liked this movie, but who they were I really have no memory of because the group of friends that I hung around in later years of my university life really did not seem to watch many movies. Basically this is a post-apocalyptic film set after a comet destroys the Earth and the planet is ruled by a megacorporation known as Water and Power. Basically they control all of the water and have all of the power (as Tank Girl explains at the beginning) but in reality, all this corporation seems to be is one executives and a bunch of soldiers with slaves and prisoners doing all of the other work. Then there are the reavers, some creatures that come out at night, live underground, and cause havoc to the corporation, and finally, there is everybody else, namely those who live out in the desert and attempt to escape the clutches of Water & Power. To me this seems to reflect the nineties struggle between Generation X and the baby boomers, with Generation X wanting to have fun, and not to pay for it, and the Baby Boomers seeking to stifle the limits of that fun. Basically the baby boomers control the means by which Generation X can enjoy themselves, though we should be mindful of the fact that it was the Baby Boomers that led the sexual revolution of the late 60s. However, as one friend pointed out, the protesters of the 60s are the corporate bosses of the 90s. However, even now we see this idea of giving the young much more power than they really know how to use (not that the baby boomers know how to use it either). I guess this film catches the essence of the 90s (not only with the grunge rock sound track). We had come out victorious from the Cold War, and it was still years away from the modern era of the Islamic terrorist and the new McCarthyism that arose under the Bush administration. We see the younger generation, as defined by Tank Girl, moving further away from the traditional roots that many of the baby boomers grew up with, and also rejecting the baby boomer's morality. However we are also seeing the beginning of the rise of the megacorporations, and the tight hold that they have on our lives. This era was also an era dominated by consolidation, as the small businesses disappear to be replaced by the big box outlets outside of town, as is represented by Walmart in America. The multitude of various companies are replaced by one single overarching company, as is seen in Australia where once we had three airline carriers, and now only have one. The same is the case with the supermarkets, which have all come under two major companies, with a collection of independent stores a distant third. Take a look on Google Maps of the various towns in the United States, where main street has all but disappeared to be replaced by shopping malls, big box outlets, and chains upon chains of fast food restaurants. This is the new world that we have entered and are struggling to survive in, in the same way that Tank Girl struggles to survive in a world dominated by Water and Power. As for the film itself, well, it is silly. In fact, it is not amusing or enjoyable silly, it is just silly. For instance, the scene where she is chasing the truck is just simply pathetic, especially where they have one shot of her cooking a barbecue on the top of her tank. To me that was not only a WOF moment, it was a roll my eyes, I can't believe this film, type of moment. As for me, I'm off to see This is the End.

    This movie probably would have worked a lot better as an animated film, and a lot of the actors did do some voice work for the DC Animated Universe. The inadequacies of the live action are hit on when they intersplice panels or animation from the actual comic. So the world ends and all the water vanishes, except that controlled by Water and Power, led by Generic Evil Guy, Malcolm McDowell. Petty is actually pretty good in the film, but this film probably killed her career. Ice-T was in this film, and sadly didn't suffer career adversity. The action scenes are okay. The comedy kind of works. I give them credit for making it, because frankly, given the awfulness that often comes out of the Hollywood assembly line is so banal.

    Tank Girl and her friends are the only remaining citizens living in the wasteland that is Earth. All the remaining water is controlled by Water and Power, the mega corporation/government that runs the territory. While incarcerated at W + P, Tank Girl and her new friend Jet Girl break out and steal... a tank and a jet. After meeting some mutant kangaroo/humans, and rescuing her little girl (adopted by her friends), the kangaroos and the girls turn on Water and Power..... It seemed like a good idea at the time, i'm sure someone said soon after the figures came in. I was all for this movie, I thought the comic was far out, and the inclusion of Petty and Macdowell were good choices. The overall product, feels a lot like the Van Damme movie Cyborg, with a little bit of Howard the Duck thrown in for good measure. To some people this is very bad, to others, it;s a sign of something quirky, something that draws you back, no matter how many times you have seen the film. I saw it at the cinema, thought it was awful, brought the VHS and thought it was awful. I've just seen it again, knowing that the film was awful, and I've enjoyed it a lot more. The story is poor, and the inclusion of the comic being shown every couple of minutes grates rather than endears, but there is value to it. The rippers look good, and Macdowell is hamming it up more than he ever did in Star Trek: Generations. And Petty really puts in a good performance as the titular character. There's no doubt i'll see this again in about seven years.

We had come out victorious from the Cold War, and it was still years away from the modern era of the Islamic terrorist and the new McCarthyism that arose under the Bush administration. We see the younger generation, as defined by Tank Girl, moving further away from the traditional roots that many of the baby boomers grew up with, and also rejecting the baby boomer's morality. However we are also seeing the beginning of the rise of the megacorporations, and the tight hold that they have on our lives. This era was also an era dominated by consolidation, as the small businesses disappear to be replaced by the big box outlets outside of town, as is represented by Walmart in America. The multitude of various companies are replaced by one single overarching company, as is seen in Australia where once we had three airline carriers, and now only have one. The same is the case with the supermarkets, which have all come under two major companies, with a collection of independent stores a distant third. Take a look on Google Maps of the various towns in the United States, where main street has all but disappeared to be replaced by shopping malls, big box outlets, and chains upon chains of fast food restaurants. This is the new world that we have entered and are struggling to survive in, in the same way that Tank Girl struggles to survive in a world dominated by Water and Power. As for the film itself, well, it is silly. In fact, it is not amusing or enjoyable silly, it is just silly. For instance, the scene where she is chasing the truck is just simply pathetic, especially where they have one shot of her cooking a barbecue on the top of her tank. To me that was not only a WOF moment, it was a roll my eyes, I can't believe this film, type of moment. As for me, I'm off to see This is the End.

    This movie probably would have worked a lot better as an animated film, and a lot of the actors did do some voice work for the DC Animated Universe. The inadequacies of the live action are hit on when they intersplice panels or animation from the actual comic. So the world ends and all the water vanishes, except that controlled by Water and Power, led by Generic Evil Guy, Malcolm McDowell. Petty is actually pretty good in the film, but this film probably killed her career. Ice-T was in this film, and sadly didn't suffer career adversity. The action scenes are okay. The comedy kind of works. I give them credit for making it, because frankly, given the awfulness that often comes out of the Hollywood assembly line is so banal.

    Tank Girl and her friends are the only remaining citizens living in the wasteland that is Earth. All the remaining water is controlled by Water and Power, the mega corporation/government that runs the territory. While incarcerated at W + P, Tank Girl and her new friend Jet Girl break out and steal... a tank and a jet. After meeting some mutant kangaroo/humans, and rescuing her little girl (adopted by her friends), the kangaroos and the girls turn on Water and Power..... It seemed like a good idea at the time, i'm sure someone said soon after the figures came in. I was all for this movie, I thought the comic was far out, and the inclusion of Petty and Macdowell were good choices. The overall product, feels a lot like the Van Damme movie Cyborg, with a little bit of Howard the Duck thrown in for good measure. To some people this is very bad, to others, it;s a sign of something quirky, something that draws you back, no matter how many times you have seen the film. I saw it at the cinema, thought it was awful, brought the VHS and thought it was awful. I've just seen it again, knowing that the film was awful, and I've enjoyed it a lot more. The story is poor, and the inclusion of the comic being shown every couple of minutes grates rather than endears, but there is value to it. The rippers look good, and Macdowell is hamming it up more than he ever did in Star Trek: Generations. And Petty really puts in a good performance as the titular character. There's no doubt i'll see this again in about seven years.

    I had heard this was a cult classic & I usually enjoy those type of movies. From the description it sounded like my type of movie. Though there were some elements that I really liked, for the most part I was let down. I love the animated comic book sequences. Those alone were almost enough to rescue the movie. However, the visuals were not as stunning as I expected. Maybe its because it's an old 90's movie, but the the ships looked they were made of cardboard, the Rippers were incredibly cheesy costumes, etc. The plot felt like something I've seen before. Goofy & overly mean villain is holding the poor masses hostage & one of the peons rises to take him down. I felt like "Rebecca" was a really fun character for Lori Petty, but I thought she was kind of stupid, mumbling weird things all throughout the movie. There seemed to me a lot of disjointed imagery and side events that confused the main focus of the movie. Lastly..."Tank Girl" rarely ever even drove her tank!

    Tank Girl is based in the year 2033 when all water and power are run by an evil dictator Kesslee, played by Malcom Mcdowell. Living on the edge and stealing water Tank Girl and her home is attacked taking her prisoner and the little girl, Sam, as well. Tank Girl, played by Lori Petti, mets the unrecognizable, Naomi Watts, who plays Jet. The two team up to rescue the young Sam and defeat Kesslee. Along the way she finds a tank that follows her like a puppy, and a gang known as the Rippers who are part Kangaroo DNA part human who also want to defeat Mcdowell. The movie is amazing, I used to watch it with my grandfather when I was younger, and just recently watched it again when I found it on Netflix. The film has everything you want. A love story (between the Ripper name Booga and Tank Girl), action, and a musical number. The plot of the movie is different which makes me like the movie so much more. It was not a remake, it has its own twist and turns on good vs. evil. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a lot of fun to watch.

    I love this the way I love Wayne's World, the Beastie Boys, and the concept of Catwoman. It's goofy/lovable, quick-witted/smart, and it's some sort of honest exploration of women as ruthless survivors (though it sounds like the comic books did a better job than the movie). Comic book adaptations today seem to be all about the special effects and having enormous balls. The female characters are sometimes more than one dimensional, but are probably not much fun to hang out with, especially during an apocalypse. Yes, I would want to hang out with Lara Croft during an apocalypse, but there you have it, the two leading roles played by women in action movies, the badass/serious/sexy and the damsel/maybe-smart-but-defenseless/sexy, so at least this movie has value in the fact that there are very few action movies with female leads in this sort of role. And the music, unhhh.....throwback whiplash. The Portishead and Bjork scenes especially. Yes. I should emphasize how campy this movie is in case anyone is expecting anything else.

    First of all, let me be clear that not everyone will like this movie. I know a number of people who just do not like fantasy or silliness in movies. If you are one of those serious people, this movie is not for you. But if you are open minded and say - hey just show me something fun and silly that may not have any reality, then this could be your movie. It also however, does have some R rated sections for both violence and sexiness. I also believe that movies should be rated on what they claim to be. This movie certainly is not "Gone with the Wind", but then again, it does not claim to be. It claims to be a silly movie about a comic book heroine that is merely trying to be entertaining - assuming one likes that genre in the first place. To a certain extent, this movie reminded me a bit of a more modern version of Jane Fonda's Barbarella - a movie also made with a sexy most odd female in an odd sci-fi world. If you liked Barbarella or the silly movie Mars Attacks, you might like this one as well. As for me, I rated this movie somewhat high based on that I think it did what it promised to do - be a silly, entertaining comedy. I also find it has an odd attraction. Again, this movie is not for everyone. But for some of us, was entertaining for 90 minutes or so.

    That is my opinion of course. I noticed before sitting down to watch Tank Girl that it has got a bad reputation for being a Hollywoodised bastardisation of the cult comic. As someone who has a lot of fondness for the comic and as an admirer of Malcolm McDowell, I found Tank Girl neither a good or terrible movie. More the disappointing but sort of watchable neck of the woods. I do give it plaudits for the colourful visuals, the upbeat soundtrack and decent performances from most of the cast. Lori Petty does have some cringe-worthy one-liners but I did find her surprisingly credible, and while Ice-T has some irritating moments he has moments where he is also fun. The best performances however come from Naomi Watts and especially Malcolm McDowell who is over-the-top but in an enjoyable way. However, the script is pretty awful. The one-liners are enough to make you cringe, the humour is stale and it also lacked the sassy black-humoured feel of the comic. The story has a great concept but for me suffered from being too unevenly paced(mostly rushed) and predictable with many moments of dumbness, a couple of limply paced scenes such as the musical scene at the Rippers' base and a few too many moments where it steers off track. Characters are a mixed bag. Tank Girl and Kesslee are fun enough, but Jet and Sub Girls are not as interesting personality-wise as they were in the comics and the Rippers more often than not are annoying. Another big disappointment is the direction, which is flashy but also too muddled, never knowing whether it is trying to handle a satire, comedy or futuristic action. Consequently the black, sassy humour could have benefited the satire and the comedy, but seeing as they were missing the humour to me seemed flat, and the more action-like parts looked clunky. Overall, I was willing to judge it on its own terms and to form my own opinion, but while I don't think Tank Girl is as bad as people say and I have seen far worse movies there wasn't really anything especially outstanding about it. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    Hard to understand. Its an "R" rated movie but its written for children, or maybe the problem is that it was directed and produced for children, whatever the case as an adult watching the movie is awkward. I'm not developmentally delayed so the child-like humor and wit of the movie is like drinking sulfuric acid, I mean Lori Petty's acting and delivery causes real pain. Some cut-scenes show the comics this movie is adapted from and those scenes are intriguing those scenes are vivid glowing things- and when you think that its merely comic book art stills, y'know, motionless movie frames then compare it to the actual motion picture, its clear that the drawings are the best parts. Everything sucks, the lighting the acting the costumes the sets, but raise a glass to Naomi Watts, she can actually act and is gorgeous as a brunette.

    First thing's first: the film's opening credits montage is pretty darn cool. With the rock music and the flashing comic-book images, I was lured in with the promise of a truly punk-spirited post-apocalypse adventure. Well, the film delivers, in the sense that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and there's adventure. This is also a very wacky film, with cartoony comic relief, cheesy action, and a very cheap production value. The good thing about this film is that the main character's attitude is so wild and fun that accentuates the goofy nature of the film, and delivers the punkish vibe I was expecting. Everything else, however, tends to be rather ridiculous. It makes for a weirdly mixed experience overall. This story is pretty basic stuff, lacking in depth or emotion. The plot wanders all over the place, lacking in specific direction. Chances are that you've seen better structure and deeper meaning in other great sci-fi films that bear all the same plot elements and characters. Tank Girl squanders its storytelling potential in favor of just being kooky. This film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Comic book images are cut in at various places. A couple of scenes are animated, and those are probably the coolest parts. Acting is extremely cheesy and over-the-top; Lori Petty uses such cheese to craft an deliciously fun and hip performance, while a very young Naomi Watts plays a perfect square, and Malcolm McDowell does his usual schtick. Writing is pretty simple-minded. This production has sets, props, and costumes that are so cheap-looking, colorful, and clean; the film almost looks like what you'd get if Pee Wee Herman's playhouse survived the apocalypse and went just slightly feral. Music is alright; the score is okay, and a number of good songs are used to give the film a little more oomph to the punk factor. Much like the actual tank in the film, Tank Girl is a cheap-looking, colorful, gaudy, haphazard assortment of random parts and cute decor. It's definitely cheesy, but it is pretty fun that way regardless. I'd say it's perfectly fitting next to other weird, cheap, and cheesy flicks like the Super Mario Bros movie, or Howard the Duck. If those appeal to you, then Tank Girl might be up your alley. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Poor | Film: Poor)

    I am not sure why I even purchased this particular film. Maybe it had something to do with the belief that it may have been a cult classic, but seriously, it is not. I remember some friends watching it and raving about it, but then again those friends have long gone, and I rarely, if ever, see them around. Maybe another group of friends liked this movie, but who they were I really have no memory of because the group of friends that I hung around in later years of my university life really did not seem to watch many movies. Basically this is a post-apocalyptic film set after a comet destroys the Earth and the planet is ruled by a megacorporation known as Water and Power. Basically they control all of the water and have all of the power (as Tank Girl explains at the beginning) but in reality, all this corporation seems to be is one executives and a bunch of soldiers with slaves and prisoners doing all of the other work. Then there are the reavers, some creatures that come out at night, live underground, and cause havoc to the corporation, and finally, there is everybody else, namely those who live out in the desert and attempt to escape the clutches of Water & Power. To me this seems to reflect the nineties struggle between Generation X and the baby boomers, with Generation X wanting to have fun, and not to pay for it, and the Baby Boomers seeking to stifle the limits of that fun. Basically the baby boomers control the means by which Generation X can enjoy themselves, though we should be mindful of the fact that it was the Baby Boomers that led the sexual revolution of the late 60s. However, as one friend pointed out, the protesters of the 60s are the corporate bosses of the 90s. However, even now we see this idea of giving the young much more power than they really know how to use (not that the baby boomers know how to use it either). I guess this film catches the essence of the 90s (not only with the grunge rock sound track). We had come out victorious from the Cold War, and it was still years away from the modern era of the Islamic terrorist and the new McCarthyism that arose under the Bush administration. We see the younger generation, as defined by Tank Girl, moving further away from the traditional roots that many of the baby boomers grew up with, and also rejecting the baby boomer's morality. However we are also seeing the beginning of the rise of the megacorporations, and the tight hold that they have on our lives.

Take a look on Google Maps of the various towns in the United States, where main street has all but disappeared to be replaced by shopping malls, big box outlets, and chains upon chains of fast food restaurants. This is the new world that we have entered and are struggling to survive in, in the same way that Tank Girl struggles to survive in a world dominated by Water and Power. As for the film itself, well, it is silly. In fact, it is not amusing or enjoyable silly, it is just silly. For instance, the scene where she is chasing the truck is just simply pathetic, especially where they have one shot of her cooking a barbecue on the top of her tank. To me that was not only a WOF moment, it was a roll my eyes, I can't believe this film, type of moment. As for me, I'm off to see This is the End.

Some cut-scenes show the comics this movie is adapted from and those scenes are intriguing those scenes are vivid glowing things- and when you think that its merely comic book art stills, y'know, motionless movie frames then compare it to the actual motion picture, its clear that the drawings are the best parts. Everything sucks, the lighting the acting the costumes the sets, but raise a glass to Naomi Watts, she can actually act and is gorgeous as a brunette.

    First thing's first: the film's opening credits montage is pretty darn cool. With the rock music and the flashing comic-book images, I was lured in with the promise of a truly punk-spirited post-apocalypse adventure. Well, the film delivers, in the sense that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and there's adventure. This is also a very wacky film, with cartoony comic relief, cheesy action, and a very cheap production value. The good thing about this film is that the main character's attitude is so wild and fun that accentuates the goofy nature of the film, and delivers the punkish vibe I was expecting. Everything else, however, tends to be rather ridiculous. It makes for a weirdly mixed experience overall. This story is pretty basic stuff, lacking in depth or emotion. The plot wanders all over the place, lacking in specific direction. Chances are that you've seen better structure and deeper meaning in other great sci-fi films that bear all the same plot elements and characters. Tank Girl squanders its storytelling potential in favor of just being kooky. This film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Comic book images are cut in at various places. A couple of scenes are animated, and those are probably the coolest parts. Acting is extremely cheesy and over-the-top; Lori Petty uses such cheese to craft an deliciously fun and hip performance, while a very young Naomi Watts plays a perfect square, and Malcolm McDowell does his usual schtick. Writing is pretty simple-minded. This production has sets, props, and costumes that are so cheap-looking, colorful, and clean; the film almost looks like what you'd get if Pee Wee Herman's playhouse survived the apocalypse and went just slightly feral. Music is alright; the score is okay, and a number of good songs are used to give the film a little more oomph to the punk factor. Much like the actual tank in the film, Tank Girl is a cheap-looking, colorful, gaudy, haphazard assortment of random parts and cute decor. It's definitely cheesy, but it is pretty fun that way regardless. I'd say it's perfectly fitting next to other weird, cheap, and cheesy flicks like the Super Mario Bros movie, or Howard the Duck. If those appeal to you, then Tank Girl might be up your alley. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Poor | Film: Poor)

    I am not sure why I even purchased this particular film. Maybe it had something to do with the belief that it may have been a cult classic, but seriously, it is not. I remember some friends watching it and raving about it, but then again those friends have long gone, and I rarely, if ever, see them around. Maybe another group of friends liked this movie, but who they were I really have no memory of because the group of friends that I hung around in later years of my university life really did not seem to watch many movies. Basically this is a post-apocalyptic film set after a comet destroys the Earth and the planet is ruled by a megacorporation known as Water and Power. Basically they control all of the water and have all of the power (as Tank Girl explains at the beginning) but in reality, all this corporation seems to be is one executives and a bunch of soldiers with slaves and prisoners doing all of the other work. Then there are the reavers, some creatures that come out at night, live underground, and cause havoc to the corporation, and finally, there is everybody else, namely those who live out in the desert and attempt to escape the clutches of Water & Power. To me this seems to reflect the nineties struggle between Generation X and the baby boomers, with Generation X wanting to have fun, and not to pay for it, and the Baby Boomers seeking to stifle the limits of that fun. Basically the baby boomers control the means by which Generation X can enjoy themselves, though we should be mindful of the fact that it was the Baby Boomers that led the sexual revolution of the late 60s. However, as one friend pointed out, the protesters of the 60s are the corporate bosses of the 90s. However, even now we see this idea of giving the young much more power than they really know how to use (not that the baby boomers know how to use it either). I guess this film catches the essence of the 90s (not only with the grunge rock sound track). We had come out victorious from the Cold War, and it was still years away from the modern era of the Islamic terrorist and the new McCarthyism that arose under the Bush administration. We see the younger generation, as defined by Tank Girl, moving further away from the traditional roots that many of the baby boomers grew up with, and also rejecting the baby boomer's morality. However we are also seeing the beginning of the rise of the megacorporations, and the tight hold that they have on our lives. This era was also an era dominated by consolidation, as the small businesses disappear to be replaced by the big box outlets outside of town, as is represented by Walmart in America. The multitude of various companies are replaced by one single overarching company, as is seen in Australia where once we had three airline carriers, and now only have one. The same is the case with the supermarkets, which have all come under two major companies, with a collection of independent stores a distant third. Take a look on Google Maps of the various towns in the United States, where main street has all but disappeared to be replaced by shopping malls, big box outlets, and chains upon chains of fast food restaurants. This is the new world that we have entered and are struggling to survive in, in the same way that Tank Girl struggles to survive in a world dominated by Water and Power. As for the film itself, well, it is silly. In fact, it is not amusing or enjoyable silly, it is just silly. For instance, the scene where she is chasing the truck is just simply pathetic, especially where they have one shot of her cooking a barbecue on the top of her tank. To me that was not only a WOF moment, it was a roll my eyes, I can't believe this film, type of moment. As for me, I'm off to see This is the End.

    This movie probably would have worked a lot better as an animated film, and a lot of the actors did do some voice work for the DC Animated Universe. The inadequacies of the live action are hit on when they intersplice panels or animation from the actual comic. So the world ends and all the water vanishes, except that controlled by Water and Power, led by Generic Evil Guy, Malcolm McDowell. Petty is actually pretty good in the film, but this film probably killed her career. Ice-T was in this film, and sadly didn't suffer career adversity. The action scenes are okay. The comedy kind of works. I give them credit for making it, because frankly, given the awfulness that often comes out of the Hollywood assembly line is so banal.

    Tank Girl and her friends are the only remaining citizens living in the wasteland that is Earth. All the remaining water is controlled by Water and Power, the mega corporation/government that runs the territory. While incarcerated at W + P, Tank Girl and her new friend Jet Girl break out and steal... a tank and a jet. After meeting some mutant kangaroo/humans, and rescuing her little girl (adopted by her friends), the kangaroos and the girls turn on Water and Power..... It seemed like a good idea at the time, i'm sure someone said soon after the figures came in. I was all for this movie, I thought the comic was far out, and the inclusion of Petty and Macdowell were good choices. The overall product, feels a lot like the Van Damme movie Cyborg, with a little bit of Howard the Duck thrown in for good measure. To some people this is very bad, to others, it;s a sign of something quirky, something that draws you back, no matter how many times you have seen the film. I saw it at the cinema, thought it was awful, brought the VHS and thought it was awful. I've just seen it again, knowing that the film was awful, and I've enjoyed it a lot more. The story is poor, and the inclusion of the comic being shown every couple of minutes grates rather than endears, but there is value to it. The rippers look good, and Macdowell is hamming it up more than he ever did in Star Trek: Generations. And Petty really puts in a good performance as the titular character. There's no doubt i'll see this again in about seven years.

    I had heard this was a cult classic & I usually enjoy those type of movies. From the description it sounded like my type of movie. Though there were some elements that I really liked, for the most part I was let down. I love the animated comic book sequences. Those alone were almost enough to rescue the movie. However, the visuals were not as stunning as I expected. Maybe its because it's an old 90's movie, but the the ships looked they were made of cardboard, the Rippers were incredibly cheesy costumes, etc. The plot felt like something I've seen before. Goofy & overly mean villain is holding the poor masses hostage & one of the peons rises to take him down. I felt like "Rebecca" was a really fun character for Lori Petty, but I thought she was kind of stupid, mumbling weird things all throughout the movie. There seemed to me a lot of disjointed imagery and side events that confused the main focus of the movie. Lastly..."Tank Girl" rarely ever even drove her tank!

    Tank Girl is based in the year 2033 when all water and power are run by an evil dictator Kesslee, played by Malcom Mcdowell. Living on the edge and stealing water Tank Girl and her home is attacked taking her prisoner and the little girl, Sam, as well. Tank Girl, played by Lori Petti, mets the unrecognizable, Naomi Watts, who plays Jet. The two team up to rescue the young Sam and defeat Kesslee. Along the way she finds a tank that follows her like a puppy, and a gang known as the Rippers who are part Kangaroo DNA part human who also want to defeat Mcdowell. The movie is amazing, I used to watch it with my grandfather when I was younger, and just recently watched it again when I found it on Netflix. The film has everything you want. A love story (between the Ripper name Booga and Tank Girl), action, and a musical number. The plot of the movie is different which makes me like the movie so much more. It was not a remake, it has its own twist and turns on good vs. evil. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a lot of fun to watch.

    I love this the way I love Wayne's World, the Beastie Boys, and the concept of Catwoman. It's goofy/lovable, quick-witted/smart, and it's some sort of honest exploration of women as ruthless survivors (though it sounds like the comic books did a better job than the movie). Comic book adaptations today seem to be all about the special effects and having enormous balls. The female characters are sometimes more than one dimensional, but are probably not much fun to hang out with, especially during an apocalypse. Yes, I would want to hang out with Lara Croft during an apocalypse, but there you have it, the two leading roles played by women in action movies, the badass/serious/sexy and the damsel/maybe-smart-but-defenseless/sexy, so at least this movie has value in the fact that there are very few action movies with female leads in this sort of role. And the music, unhhh.....throwback whiplash. The Portishead and Bjork scenes especially. Yes. I should emphasize how campy this movie is in case anyone is expecting anything else.

    First of all, let me be clear that not everyone will like this movie. I know a number of people who just do not like fantasy or silliness in movies. If you are one of those serious people, this movie is not for you. But if you are open minded and say - hey just show me something fun and silly that may not have any reality, then this could be your movie. It also however, does have some R rated sections for both violence and sexiness. I also believe that movies should be rated on what they claim to be. This movie certainly is not "Gone with the Wind", but then again, it does not claim to be. It claims to be a silly movie about a comic book heroine that is merely trying to be entertaining - assuming one likes that genre in the first place. To a certain extent, this movie reminded me a bit of a more modern version of Jane Fonda's Barbarella - a movie also made with a sexy most odd female in an odd sci-fi world. If you liked Barbarella or the silly movie Mars Attacks, you might like this one as well. As for me, I rated this movie somewhat high based on that I think it did what it promised to do - be a silly, entertaining comedy. I also find it has an odd attraction. Again, this movie is not for everyone. But for some of us, was entertaining for 90 minutes or so.

    That is my opinion of course. I noticed before sitting down to watch Tank Girl that it has got a bad reputation for being a Hollywoodised bastardisation of the cult comic. As someone who has a lot of fondness for the comic and as an admirer of Malcolm McDowell, I found Tank Girl neither a good or terrible movie. More the disappointing but sort of watchable neck of the woods. I do give it plaudits for the colourful visuals, the upbeat soundtrack and decent performances from most of the cast. Lori Petty does have some cringe-worthy one-liners but I did find her surprisingly credible, and while Ice-T has some irritating moments he has moments where he is also fun. The best performances however come from Naomi Watts and especially Malcolm McDowell who is over-the-top but in an enjoyable way. However, the script is pretty awful. The one-liners are enough to make you cringe, the humour is stale and it also lacked the sassy black-humoured feel of the comic. The story has a great concept but for me suffered from being too unevenly paced(mostly rushed) and predictable with many moments of dumbness, a couple of limply paced scenes such as the musical scene at the Rippers' base and a few too many moments where it steers off track. Characters are a mixed bag. Tank Girl and Kesslee are fun enough, but Jet and Sub Girls are not as interesting personality-wise as they were in the comics and the Rippers more often than not are annoying. Another big disappointment is the direction, which is flashy but also too muddled, never knowing whether it is trying to handle a satire, comedy or futuristic action. Consequently the black, sassy humour could have benefited the satire and the comedy, but seeing as they were missing the humour to me seemed flat, and the more action-like parts looked clunky. Overall, I was willing to judge it on its own terms and to form my own opinion, but while I don't think Tank Girl is as bad as people say and I have seen far worse movies there wasn't really anything especially outstanding about it. 4/10 Bethany Cox

Yes, I would want to hang out with Lara Croft during an apocalypse, but there you have it, the two leading roles played by women in action movies, the badass/serious/sexy and the damsel/maybe-smart-but-defenseless/sexy, so at least this movie has value in the fact that there are very few action movies with female leads in this sort of role. And the music, unhhh.....throwback whiplash. The Portishead and Bjork scenes especially. Yes. I should emphasize how campy this movie is in case anyone is expecting anything else.

    First of all, let me be clear that not everyone will like this movie. I know a number of people who just do not like fantasy or silliness in movies. If you are one of those serious people, this movie is not for you. But if you are open minded and say - hey just show me something fun and silly that may not have any reality, then this could be your movie. It also however, does have some R rated sections for both violence and sexiness. I also believe that movies should be rated on what they claim to be. This movie certainly is not "Gone with the Wind", but then again, it does not claim to be. It claims to be a silly movie about a comic book heroine that is merely trying to be entertaining - assuming one likes that genre in the first place. To a certain extent, this movie reminded me a bit of a more modern version of Jane Fonda's Barbarella - a movie also made with a sexy most odd female in an odd sci-fi world. If you liked Barbarella or the silly movie Mars Attacks, you might like this one as well. As for me, I rated this movie somewhat high based on that I think it did what it promised to do - be a silly, entertaining comedy. I also find it has an odd attraction. Again, this movie is not for everyone. But for some of us, was entertaining for 90 minutes or so.

    That is my opinion of course. I noticed before sitting down to watch Tank Girl that it has got a bad reputation for being a Hollywoodised bastardisation of the cult comic. As someone who has a lot of fondness for the comic and as an admirer of Malcolm McDowell, I found Tank Girl neither a good or terrible movie. More the disappointing but sort of watchable neck of the woods. I do give it plaudits for the colourful visuals, the upbeat soundtrack and decent performances from most of the cast. Lori Petty does have some cringe-worthy one-liners but I did find her surprisingly credible, and while Ice-T has some irritating moments he has moments where he is also fun. The best performances however come from Naomi Watts and especially Malcolm McDowell who is over-the-top but in an enjoyable way. However, the script is pretty awful. The one-liners are enough to make you cringe, the humour is stale and it also lacked the sassy black-humoured feel of the comic. The story has a great concept but for me suffered from being too unevenly paced(mostly rushed) and predictable with many moments of dumbness, a couple of limply paced scenes such as the musical scene at the Rippers' base and a few too many moments where it steers off track. Characters are a mixed bag. Tank Girl and Kesslee are fun enough, but Jet and Sub Girls are not as interesting personality-wise as they were in the comics and the Rippers more often than not are annoying. Another big disappointment is the direction, which is flashy but also too muddled, never knowing whether it is trying to handle a satire, comedy or futuristic action. Consequently the black, sassy humour could have benefited the satire and the comedy, but seeing as they were missing the humour to me seemed flat, and the more action-like parts looked clunky. Overall, I was willing to judge it on its own terms and to form my own opinion, but while I don't think Tank Girl is as bad as people say and I have seen far worse movies there wasn't really anything especially outstanding about it. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    Hard to understand. Its an "R" rated movie but its written for children, or maybe the problem is that it was directed and produced for children, whatever the case as an adult watching the movie is awkward. I'm not developmentally delayed so the child-like humor and wit of the movie is like drinking sulfuric acid, I mean Lori Petty's acting and delivery causes real pain. Some cut-scenes show the comics this movie is adapted from and those scenes are intriguing those scenes are vivid glowing things- and when you think that its merely comic book art stills, y'know, motionless movie frames then compare it to the actual motion picture, its clear that the drawings are the best parts. Everything sucks, the lighting the acting the costumes the sets, but raise a glass to Naomi Watts, she can actually act and is gorgeous as a brunette.

    First thing's first: the film's opening credits montage is pretty darn cool. With the rock music and the flashing comic-book images, I was lured in with the promise of a truly punk-spirited post-apocalypse adventure. Well, the film delivers, in the sense that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and there's adventure. This is also a very wacky film, with cartoony comic relief, cheesy action, and a very cheap production value. The good thing about this film is that the main character's attitude is so wild and fun that accentuates the goofy nature of the film, and delivers the punkish vibe I was expecting. Everything else, however, tends to be rather ridiculous. It makes for a weirdly mixed experience overall. This story is pretty basic stuff, lacking in depth or emotion. The plot wanders all over the place, lacking in specific direction. Chances are that you've seen better structure and deeper meaning in other great sci-fi films that bear all the same plot elements and characters. Tank Girl squanders its storytelling potential in favor of just being kooky. This film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Comic book images are cut in at various places. A couple of scenes are animated, and those are probably the coolest parts. Acting is extremely cheesy and over-the-top; Lori Petty uses such cheese to craft an deliciously fun and hip performance, while a very young Naomi Watts plays a perfect square, and Malcolm McDowell does his usual schtick. Writing is pretty simple-minded. This production has sets, props, and costumes that are so cheap-looking, colorful, and clean; the film almost looks like what you'd get if Pee Wee Herman's playhouse survived the apocalypse and went just slightly feral. Music is alright; the score is okay, and a number of good songs are used to give the film a little more oomph to the punk factor. Much like the actual tank in the film, Tank Girl is a cheap-looking, colorful, gaudy, haphazard assortment of random parts and cute decor. It's definitely cheesy, but it is pretty fun that way regardless. I'd say it's perfectly fitting next to other weird, cheap, and cheesy flicks like the Super Mario Bros movie, or Howard the Duck. If those appeal to you, then Tank Girl might be up your alley. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Poor | Film: Poor)

    I am not sure why I even purchased this particular film. Maybe it had something to do with the belief that it may have been a cult classic, but seriously, it is not. I remember some friends watching it and raving about it, but then again those friends have long gone, and I rarely, if ever, see them around. Maybe another group of friends liked this movie, but who they were I really have no memory of because the group of friends that I hung around in later years of my university life really did not seem to watch many movies. Basically this is a post-apocalyptic film set after a comet destroys the Earth and the planet is ruled by a megacorporation known as Water and Power. Basically they control all of the water and have all of the power (as Tank Girl explains at the beginning) but in reality, all this corporation seems to be is one executives and a bunch of soldiers with slaves and prisoners doing all of the other work. Then there are the reavers, some creatures that come out at night, live underground, and cause havoc to the corporation, and finally, there is everybody else, namely those who live out in the desert and attempt to escape the clutches of Water & Power. To me this seems to reflect the nineties struggle between Generation X and the baby boomers, with Generation X wanting to have fun, and not to pay for it, and the Baby Boomers seeking to stifle the limits of that fun. Basically the baby boomers control the means by which Generation X can enjoy themselves, though we should be mindful of the fact that it was the Baby Boomers that led the sexual revolution of the late 60s. However, as one friend pointed out, the protesters of the 60s are the corporate bosses of the 90s. However, even now we see this idea of giving the young much more power than they really know how to use (not that the baby boomers know how to use it either). I guess this film catches the essence of the 90s (not only with the grunge rock sound track). We had come out victorious from the Cold War, and it was still years away from the modern era of the Islamic terrorist and the new McCarthyism that arose under the Bush administration. We see the younger generation, as defined by Tank Girl, moving further away from the traditional roots that many of the baby boomers grew up with, and also rejecting the baby boomer's morality. However we are also seeing the beginning of the rise of the megacorporations, and the tight hold that they have on our lives. This era was also an era dominated by consolidation, as the small businesses disappear to be replaced by the big box outlets outside of town, as is represented by Walmart in America. The multitude of various companies are replaced by one single overarching company, as is seen in Australia where once we had three airline carriers, and now only have one. The same is the case with the supermarkets, which have all come under two major companies, with a collection of independent stores a distant third. Take a look on Google Maps of the various towns in the United States, where main street has all but disappeared to be replaced by shopping malls, big box outlets, and chains upon chains of fast food restaurants. This is the new world that we have entered and are struggling to survive in, in the same way that Tank Girl struggles to survive in a world dominated by Water and Power. As for the film itself, well, it is silly. In fact, it is not amusing or enjoyable silly, it is just silly. For instance, the scene where she is chasing the truck is just simply pathetic, especially where they have one shot of her cooking a barbecue on the top of her tank. To me that was not only a WOF moment, it was a roll my eyes, I can't believe this film, type of moment. As for me, I'm off to see This is the End.

    This movie probably would have worked a lot better as an animated film, and a lot of the actors did do some voice work for the DC Animated Universe. The inadequacies of the live action are hit on when they intersplice panels or animation from the actual comic. So the world ends and all the water vanishes, except that controlled by Water and Power, led by Generic Evil Guy, Malcolm McDowell. Petty is actually pretty good in the film, but this film probably killed her career. Ice-T was in this film, and sadly didn't suffer career adversity. The action scenes are okay. The comedy kind of works. I give them credit for making it, because frankly, given the awfulness that often comes out of the Hollywood assembly line is so banal.

    Tank Girl and her friends are the only remaining citizens living in the wasteland that is Earth. All the remaining water is controlled by Water and Power, the mega corporation/government that runs the territory. While incarcerated at W + P, Tank Girl and her new friend Jet Girl break out and steal... a tank and a jet. After meeting some mutant kangaroo/humans, and rescuing her little girl (adopted by her friends), the kangaroos and the girls turn on Water and Power..... It seemed like a good idea at the time, i'm sure someone said soon after the figures came in. I was all for this movie, I thought the comic was far out, and the inclusion of Petty and Macdowell were good choices. The overall product, feels a lot like the Van Damme movie Cyborg, with a little bit of Howard the Duck thrown in for good measure. To some people this is very bad, to others, it;s a sign of something quirky, something that draws you back, no matter how many times you have seen the film. I saw it at the cinema, thought it was awful, brought the VHS and thought it was awful. I've just seen it again, knowing that the film was awful, and I've enjoyed it a lot more. The story is poor, and the inclusion of the comic being shown every couple of minutes grates rather than endears, but there is value to it. The rippers look good, and Macdowell is hamming it up more than he ever did in Star Trek: Generations. And Petty really puts in a good performance as the titular character. There's no doubt i'll see this again in about seven years.

    I had heard this was a cult classic & I usually enjoy those type of movies. From the description it sounded like my type of movie. Though there were some elements that I really liked, for the most part I was let down. I love the animated comic book sequences. Those alone were almost enough to rescue the movie. However, the visuals were not as stunning as I expected. Maybe its because it's an old 90's movie, but the the ships looked they were made of cardboard, the Rippers were incredibly cheesy costumes, etc. The plot felt like something I've seen before. Goofy & overly mean villain is holding the poor masses hostage & one of the peons rises to take him down. I felt like "Rebecca" was a really fun character for Lori Petty, but I thought she was kind of stupid, mumbling weird things all throughout the movie. There seemed to me a lot of disjointed imagery and side events that confused the main focus of the movie. Lastly..."Tank Girl" rarely ever even drove her tank!

    Tank Girl is based in the year 2033 when all water and power are run by an evil dictator Kesslee, played by Malcom Mcdowell. Living on the edge and stealing water Tank Girl and her home is attacked taking her prisoner and the little girl, Sam, as well. Tank Girl, played by Lori Petti, mets the unrecognizable, Naomi Watts, who plays Jet. The two team up to rescue the young Sam and defeat Kesslee. Along the way she finds a tank that follows her like a puppy, and a gang known as the Rippers who are part Kangaroo DNA part human who also want to defeat Mcdowell. The movie is amazing, I used to watch it with my grandfather when I was younger, and just recently watched it again when I found it on Netflix. The film has everything you want. A love story (between the Ripper name Booga and Tank Girl), action, and a musical number. The plot of the movie is different which makes me like the movie so much more. It was not a remake, it has its own twist and turns on good vs. evil. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a lot of fun to watch.

    I love this the way I love Wayne's World, the Beastie Boys, and the concept of Catwoman. It's goofy/lovable, quick-witted/smart, and it's some sort of honest exploration of women as ruthless survivors (though it sounds like the comic books did a better job than the movie). Comic book adaptations today seem to be all about the special effects and having enormous balls. The female characters are sometimes more than one dimensional, but are probably not much fun to hang out with, especially during an apocalypse. Yes, I would want to hang out with Lara Croft during an apocalypse, but there you have it, the two leading roles played by women in action movies, the badass/serious/sexy and the damsel/maybe-smart-but-defenseless/sexy, so at least this movie has value in the fact that there are very few action movies with female leads in this sort of role. And the music, unhhh.....throwback whiplash. The Portishead and Bjork scenes especially. Yes. I should emphasize how campy this movie is in case anyone is expecting anything else.

    Tank Girl and her friends are the only remaining citizens living in the wasteland that is Earth. All the remaining water is controlled by Water and Power, the mega corporation/government that runs the territory. While incarcerated at W + P, Tank Girl and her new friend Jet Girl break out and steal... a tank and a jet. After meeting some mutant kangaroo/humans, and rescuing her little girl (adopted by her friends), the kangaroos and the girls turn on Water and Power..... It seemed like a good idea at the time, i'm sure someone said soon after the figures came in. I was all for this movie, I thought the comic was far out, and the inclusion of Petty and Macdowell were good choices. The overall product, feels a lot like the Van Damme movie Cyborg, with a little bit of Howard the Duck thrown in for good measure. To some people this is very bad, to others, it;s a sign of something quirky, something that draws you back, no matter how many times you have seen the film. I saw it at the cinema, thought it was awful, brought the VHS and thought it was awful. I've just seen it again, knowing that the film was awful, and I've enjoyed it a lot more. The story is poor, and the inclusion of the comic being shown every couple of minutes grates rather than endears, but there is value to it. The rippers look good, and Macdowell is hamming it up more than he ever did in Star Trek: Generations. And Petty really puts in a good performance as the titular character. There's no doubt i'll see this again in about seven years.

    I had heard this was a cult classic & I usually enjoy those type of movies. From the description it sounded like my type of movie. Though there were some elements that I really liked, for the most part I was let down. I love the animated comic book sequences. Those alone were almost enough to rescue the movie. However, the visuals were not as stunning as I expected. Maybe its because it's an old 90's movie, but the the ships looked they were made of cardboard, the Rippers were incredibly cheesy costumes, etc. The plot felt like something I've seen before. Goofy & overly mean villain is holding the poor masses hostage & one of the peons rises to take him down. I felt like "Rebecca" was a really fun character for Lori Petty, but I thought she was kind of stupid, mumbling weird things all throughout the movie. There seemed to me a lot of disjointed imagery and side events that confused the main focus of the movie. Lastly..."Tank Girl" rarely ever even drove her tank!

    Tank Girl is based in the year 2033 when all water and power are run by an evil dictator Kesslee, played by Malcom Mcdowell. Living on the edge and stealing water Tank Girl and her home is attacked taking her prisoner and the little girl, Sam, as well. Tank Girl, played by Lori Petti, mets the unrecognizable, Naomi Watts, who plays Jet. The two team up to rescue the young Sam and defeat Kesslee. Along the way she finds a tank that follows her like a puppy, and a gang known as the Rippers who are part Kangaroo DNA part human who also want to defeat Mcdowell. The movie is amazing, I used to watch it with my grandfather when I was younger, and just recently watched it again when I found it on Netflix. The film has everything you want. A love story (between the Ripper name Booga and Tank Girl), action, and a musical number. The plot of the movie is different which makes me like the movie so much more. It was not a remake, it has its own twist and turns on good vs. evil. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a lot of fun to watch.

    I love this the way I love Wayne's World, the Beastie Boys, and the concept of Catwoman. It's goofy/lovable, quick-witted/smart, and it's some sort of honest exploration of women as ruthless survivors (though it sounds like the comic books did a better job than the movie). Comic book adaptations today seem to be all about the special effects and having enormous balls. The female characters are sometimes more than one dimensional, but are probably not much fun to hang out with, especially during an apocalypse. Yes, I would want to hang out with Lara Croft during an apocalypse, but there you have it, the two leading roles played by women in action movies, the badass/serious/sexy and the damsel/maybe-smart-but-defenseless/sexy, so at least this movie has value in the fact that there are very few action movies with female leads in this sort of role. And the music, unhhh.....throwback whiplash. The Portishead and Bjork scenes especially. Yes. I should emphasize how campy this movie is in case anyone is expecting anything else.

    First of all, let me be clear that not everyone will like this movie. I know a number of people who just do not like fantasy or silliness in movies. If you are one of those serious people, this movie is not for you. But if you are open minded and say - hey just show me something fun and silly that may not have any reality, then this could be your movie. It also however, does have some R rated sections for both violence and sexiness. I also believe that movies should be rated on what they claim to be. This movie certainly is not "Gone with the Wind", but then again, it does not claim to be. It claims to be a silly movie about a comic book heroine that is merely trying to be entertaining - assuming one likes that genre in the first place. To a certain extent, this movie reminded me a bit of a more modern version of Jane Fonda's Barbarella - a movie also made with a sexy most odd female in an odd sci-fi world. If you liked Barbarella or the silly movie Mars Attacks, you might like this one as well. As for me, I rated this movie somewhat high based on that I think it did what it promised to do - be a silly, entertaining comedy. I also find it has an odd attraction. Again, this movie is not for everyone. But for some of us, was entertaining for 90 minutes or so.

    That is my opinion of course. I noticed before sitting down to watch Tank Girl that it has got a bad reputation for being a Hollywoodised bastardisation of the cult comic. As someone who has a lot of fondness for the comic and as an admirer of Malcolm McDowell, I found Tank Girl neither a good or terrible movie. More the disappointing but sort of watchable neck of the woods. I do give it plaudits for the colourful visuals, the upbeat soundtrack and decent performances from most of the cast. Lori Petty does have some cringe-worthy one-liners but I did find her surprisingly credible, and while Ice-T has some irritating moments he has moments where he is also fun. The best performances however come from Naomi Watts and especially Malcolm McDowell who is over-the-top but in an enjoyable way. However, the script is pretty awful. The one-liners are enough to make you cringe, the humour is stale and it also lacked the sassy black-humoured feel of the comic. The story has a great concept but for me suffered from being too unevenly paced(mostly rushed) and predictable with many moments of dumbness, a couple of limply paced scenes such as the musical scene at the Rippers' base and a few too many moments where it steers off track. Characters are a mixed bag. Tank Girl and Kesslee are fun enough, but Jet and Sub Girls are not as interesting personality-wise as they were in the comics and the Rippers more often than not are annoying. Another big disappointment is the direction, which is flashy but also too muddled, never knowing whether it is trying to handle a satire, comedy or futuristic action. Consequently the black, sassy humour could have benefited the satire and the comedy, but seeing as they were missing the humour to me seemed flat, and the more action-like parts looked clunky. Overall, I was willing to judge it on its own terms and to form my own opinion, but while I don't think Tank Girl is as bad as people say and I have seen far worse movies there wasn't really anything especially outstanding about it. 4/10 Bethany Cox

    Hard to understand. Its an "R" rated movie but its written for children, or maybe the problem is that it was directed and produced for children, whatever the case as an adult watching the movie is awkward. I'm not developmentally delayed so the child-like humor and wit of the movie is like drinking sulfuric acid, I mean Lori Petty's acting and delivery causes real pain. Some cut-scenes show the comics this movie is adapted from and those scenes are intriguing those scenes are vivid glowing things- and when you think that its merely comic book art stills, y'know, motionless movie frames then compare it to the actual motion picture, its clear that the drawings are the best parts. Everything sucks, the lighting the acting the costumes the sets, but raise a glass to Naomi Watts, she can actually act and is gorgeous as a brunette.

    First thing's first: the film's opening credits montage is pretty darn cool. With the rock music and the flashing comic-book images, I was lured in with the promise of a truly punk-spirited post-apocalypse adventure. Well, the film delivers, in the sense that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and there's adventure. This is also a very wacky film, with cartoony comic relief, cheesy action, and a very cheap production value. The good thing about this film is that the main character's attitude is so wild and fun that accentuates the goofy nature of the film, and delivers the punkish vibe I was expecting. Everything else, however, tends to be rather ridiculous. It makes for a weirdly mixed experience overall. This story is pretty basic stuff, lacking in depth or emotion. The plot wanders all over the place, lacking in specific direction. Chances are that you've seen better structure and deeper meaning in other great sci-fi films that bear all the same plot elements and characters. Tank Girl squanders its storytelling potential in favor of just being kooky. This film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Comic book images are cut in at various places. A couple of scenes are animated, and those are probably the coolest parts. Acting is extremely cheesy and over-the-top; Lori Petty uses such cheese to craft an deliciously fun and hip performance, while a very young Naomi Watts plays a perfect square, and Malcolm McDowell does his usual schtick. Writing is pretty simple-minded. This production has sets, props, and costumes that are so cheap-looking, colorful, and clean; the film almost looks like what you'd get if Pee Wee Herman's playhouse survived the apocalypse and went just slightly feral. Music is alright; the score is okay, and a number of good songs are used to give the film a little more oomph to the punk factor. Much like the actual tank in the film, Tank Girl is a cheap-looking, colorful, gaudy, haphazard assortment of random parts and cute decor. It's definitely cheesy, but it is pretty fun that way regardless. I'd say it's perfectly fitting next to other weird, cheap, and cheesy flicks like the Super Mario Bros movie, or Howard the Duck. If those appeal to you, then Tank Girl might be up your alley. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Poor | Film: Poor)

    I am not sure why I even purchased this particular film. Maybe it had something to do with the belief that it may have been a cult classic, but seriously, it is not. I remember some friends watching it and raving about it, but then again those friends have long gone, and I rarely, if ever, see them around. Maybe another group of friends liked this movie, but who they were I really have no memory of because the group of friends that I hung around in later years of my university life really did not seem to watch many movies. Basically this is a post-apocalyptic film set after a comet destroys the Earth and the planet is ruled by a megacorporation known as Water and Power. Basically they control all of the water and have all of the power (as Tank Girl explains at the beginning) but in reality, all this corporation seems to be is one executives and a bunch of soldiers with slaves and prisoners doing all of the other work. Then there are the reavers, some creatures that come out at night, live underground, and cause havoc to the corporation, and finally, there is everybody else, namely those who live out in the desert and attempt to escape the clutches of Water & Power. To me this seems to reflect the nineties struggle between Generation X and the baby boomers, with Generation X wanting to have fun, and not to pay for it, and the Baby Boomers seeking to stifle the limits of that fun. Basically the baby boomers control the means by which Generation X can enjoy themselves, though we should be mindful of the fact that it was the Baby Boomers that led the sexual revolution of the late 60s. However, as one friend pointed out, the protesters of the 60s are the corporate bosses of the 90s. However, even now we see this idea of giving the young much more power than they really know how to use (not that the baby boomers know how to use it either). I guess this film catches the essence of the 90s (not only with the grunge rock sound track). We had come out victorious from the Cold War, and it was still years away from the modern era of the Islamic terrorist and the new McCarthyism that arose under the Bush administration. We see the younger generation, as defined by Tank Girl, moving further away from the traditional roots that many of the baby boomers grew up with, and also rejecting the baby boomer's morality. However we are also seeing the beginning of the rise of the megacorporations, and the tight hold that they have on our lives. This era was also an era dominated by consolidation, as the small businesses disappear to be replaced by the big box outlets outside of town, as is represented by Walmart in America. The multitude of various companies are replaced by one single overarching company, as is seen in Australia where once we had three airline carriers, and now only have one. The same is the case with the supermarkets, which have all come under two major companies, with a collection of independent stores a distant third. Take a look on Google Maps of the various towns in the United States, where main street has all but disappeared to be replaced by shopping malls, big box outlets, and chains upon chains of fast food restaurants. This is the new world that we have entered and are struggling to survive in, in the same way that Tank Girl struggles to survive in a world dominated by Water and Power. As for the film itself, well, it is silly. In fact, it is not amusing or enjoyable silly, it is just silly. For instance, the scene where she is chasing the truck is just simply pathetic, especially where they have one shot of her cooking a barbecue on the top of her tank. To me that was not only a WOF moment, it was a roll my eyes, I can't believe this film, type of moment. As for me, I'm off to see This is the End.

    This movie probably would have worked a lot better as an animated film, and a lot of the actors did do some voice work for the DC Animated Universe. The inadequacies of the live action are hit on when they intersplice panels or animation from the actual comic. So the world ends and all the water vanishes, except that controlled by Water and Power, led by Generic Evil Guy, Malcolm McDowell. Petty is actually pretty good in the film, but this film probably killed her career. Ice-T was in this film, and sadly didn't suffer career adversity. The action scenes are okay. The comedy kind of works. I give them credit for making it, because frankly, given the awfulness that often comes out of the Hollywood assembly line is so banal.
