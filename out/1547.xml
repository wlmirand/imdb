    This was the first Riverdance for most of us to see and enjoy, beginning in the mid '90s. Michael Flatley and Jean Butler are the lead dancers and both are fun to watch. To me, the more Irish the song, the better. There is at least one song that is not Irish: the African "Freedom" number, and I wonder why it is in the show. The dancing is excellent and usually fun to watch. Butler doesn't tap dance much, but even in the fast ballet-type numbers she is a joy to watch for her amazing footwork and her beauty - a great face and even greater legs! Flatley leads a talented group of dancers. He's pretty amazing, too: a great talent. I prefer him in this show as opposed to the 1998 Lord Of The Dance, where he seems full of himself. I don't see that ego in this performance, just his dancing. The bagpipe number by Davy Spillane was interesting but went on too long. Marai Pages may not be the beauty like Butler, but so what? Her flamenco dancing is always a treat. Overall, a great show that put Riverdance on the map, worldwide.

    I've been an Irish dancer, on and off, for several years, but what got me started in the first place, as it did all over the world to budding Irish dancers, was THIS show. The overall efforts of the Dancing troupe, Maria Pages (the fiery flamenco dancer), Bill Whelan (composer)and Michael Flatley and Jean Butler are amazing. The music is at times very fast paced, and you can barely catch all that's happening in stage, let alone wonder how they do it, and other times it's incredibly sad and haunting (Davy Spillane, Irish bagpipe player, who coaxes breathtaking laments out of a very complex instrument to play). And the dancing is a whirlwind of shoe tapping, perfect synchronous and well-timed. Not to mention...SO COOL! The Moscow Ballet Troupe is so acrobatic, and fun- and the singing really is heavenly (thanks to the choral sensation 'Anuna'). The American Tap Group was a blend of the comical and the captivating, all wonderfully talented, and the two lead dancers, Michael and Jean, are the greatest presences on stage EVER. Despite the many productions that followed, no-one could manage the 'show' character to be able to fill up a stage like those pair! (Or an audience.) And Maria Page defines the word 'graceful' with her Firedance- my favourite couple dance in the world, is the one between her and Michael. Riverdance is an amazing and brilliant first step onto the wider world stage, for both Irish dancing and its rich tapestry of history and folklore. Anyone who hasn't seen this is missing out!

    The clicks of the dancers shoes beat in synchronization with my heart. The Rockettes could not hold a candle in Radio City to these fabulous step dancers. I sat mesmerized as in a trance watching the intricate step work of the Lords and Ladies of the Dance.

    This show is incredible. I must admit, I have never seen a Broadway show in person. But this Dublin version of Riverdance (the original version, I believe) meets my impression of "The best of the best." For me, this version is the basis for any followup, and includes a synergy between Michael Flatley and Jean Butler that does not exist between Colin Dunne and Jean Butler. This is not meant to take away from Colin's obvious talents, but only to make sure the magic between Michael and Jean is not overlooked. Using what I think is the current vernacular, I was "blown away" by this show. All of the dance routines are great. I particularly like the routine where the three female dancers use skirt linings of red, blue, and green. The performance is spectacular and the stunts are entertaining and something I look forward to. I am going to buy a second video of this performance in case I wear out the first tape. I do wish it were on DVD.

    It is because of the movie "Billy Elliot" that I wanted to watch "Riverdance"; I just needed some more of that folk dance foot-stomping energy that Billy would use at the beginning of his dances and I figured that Riverdance would have it. And boy does it have it, and then some! I have never seen and hardly dared imagine anything like this before. And never again can anybody say, "white folk don't have rhythm"--you can hardly be more "white" than the Irish, nor hardly more rhythmic than what was displayed here! Michael Flatley, the composer, and his spectacular companies of dancers and musicians have created and performed a phenomenally inspiring and soul-stirring exhibition of pride, power, and beauty. I've heard of ballet dancers who leap and then seem to hang in the air in violation of the dictates of gravity. Well, the same is true with these dancers, who, with the complicated patterns of leg kicks interspersed with their powerful tap dancing seem to be as immune from gravity as winged unicorns. Historically, the Irish have had a hard time of it (Angela's Ashes and all that), but listening to music like this where the human spirit infinitely yearns and the body prevails against any obstacle, I can feel the mystical, eternal strength of ancient Celtic and Druidic roots that predated Roman and Christian invasions. I'm not really sure of the meaning of the title, "Riverdance", but I believe it has something to do with leprechaun-like water spirits; there is an emotional element of fairyland magic or the revelation of a mystical dimension that is somehow inside the world we normally inhabit. The Irish are true survivors and now, finally, their country is emerging as one of the most successful economic powerhouses in the new Europe--they have amply shown that they have the strength, magic, and spirit to prevail; may they long and abundantly prosper. Beyond the spiritual and physical dimensions of these performances, there was a great intellectualism, too, a mathematics and spacial relations in the dance routines that was an amazement and a delight to the mind as well as to the eye. What a joy it all was to behold: such smiling stamina, such expressive integration with the rhythms and the emotions of the music, what beautiful and humorous people who seemed to be having as much fun exploding their controlled energy on stage as it was for the ecstatic audience to watch them. And finally, Michael Flatley, obviously the star of the show, never quite lorded over everybody else or succumbed to what might be a justifiable arrogance, but freely expressed through winks, smiles, and various pats on the arm signs of warmth, appreciation, and love for his fellow dancers, which was a great pleasure to see. I happily wear green on St. Patrick's Day and my roots are from somewhere on the British Isles, but now that I've seen "Riverdance", I really wish that I were Irish!

    I bought both videos and the CD after seeing the live performance at Wolf Trap Park for the Performing Arts in Vienna, VA. It still takes my breath away when I watch the video. I am 41 years old, and only two things have ever taken my breath away like that. One was flying over the Big Island of Hawai'i in a helicopter, and the other was seeing Riverdance. If you can possibly see the live performance, do so. Otherwise, see the video.
