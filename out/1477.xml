    I must say that this is a fairly good movie to watch lonely at night. Must admit the fact that I haven't seen the original but based on the reviews on IMDb, the original must be too scary and better. This remade Hollywood version is not that scary but will keep you in pulse with the movie till the last scene. Some good performance from the lead casts. The movie features brutal murder scenes and nudity so strictly not for the underage or faint-hearted. Imo, the screenplay could have been made much scarier for a movie with such a storyline and the director could have held suspense a bit longer. The bottom line is -- "Not too scary still good to Night-watch"...

    A law student takes a job as the night-watch in a morgue, thinking that he will have much time to study, with his biggest problem being his paranoia. But in the history of this morgue was once a man raping female corpses, but has history really gone...... A remake of a film I've never seen, Nightwatch was supposed to be Macgregors big break into Hollywood, but 1997 was Ewan's Anu Horribilus.... The man was hot stuff after Trainspotting, Brassed Off, and Shallow Grave, but this bombed, and Hodge, Boyle, and Ewan couldn't recapture the magic with a Life Less Ordinary. So to be fair, not counting a certain pillage of a franchise, Macgregor never really got noticed in Hollywood until 2005 with The Island. Despite this films flaws, is still enjoyable, despite the fact that Brolins character should have been called Red Herring, and Arquette does very little. Macgregor plays a fresh faced student, who has it all, girlfriend, apartment, strange friend, and even stranger job. But he soon becomes prime suspect for all the murders that are happening, because dastardly Nick Nolte is setting him up, as Nolte has a history, which is heavily hinted on many occasion. Brolin is way too over the top to make you suspect him, as is Dourif, so you know from the upstart that Nolte will be the killer, which spoils the rest of the film. So apart from one very good scene involving Arquette finding a body (the whole scene is very early eighties De Palma), its all pretty generic stuff, which is a shame as now I've no interest in seeing the original, which may sound ignorant, but what's the point if you know who the killer is.....

    There are better films out there, sure, but this little hidden gem is definitely worth a watch, particularly if you like the kind of thriller that has a paranormal tint to it. McGregor is very good here (although he seems to possess the weirdest accent out there) as is Josh Brolin and Nick Nolte. The plot concerns a young man who takes the job as the night watchman at a spooky morgue. Things start to play on his mind, and as they do the bodies begin to rack up as a serial killer is on the loose. Is it McGregor? Or is his mind playing tricks on him, and if so who is the killer? Watch and see!

    I am not into horror movies where terrible events happen in someone's mind or imagination, when nothing is going on in reality (with very few exceptions like The Others); it may be interesting to watch and share the feelings, but by the end of the film you feel betrayed and disappointed. In Nightwatch, horror film elements are combined with committed crimes, and the result is not bad. McGregor, Nolte and Brolin perform especially well, female characters seem mediocre, even Arquette, but perhaps her part was not elaborated. I would have shortened the ending: when the doer becomes known, the subsequent scenes are too protracted and the horror-crime film remains a crime feature film only. But still recommended, the film is not too long and the venue (hospital morgue) has been exploited well.

    Co-writer / director Ole Bornedal's English language remake of his earlier Danish hit "Nattevagten" is pretty good stuff, a substantially atmospheric and creepy thriller that milks the ambiance of its locations for everything that they're worth. Ewan McGregor, doing a superb American accent, is law student Martin Bells, who takes a part time job as night watchman at the city morgue. His best friend James (Josh Brolin) is bored with their humdrum lives and goes about doing some reckless things, while a serial killer is haunting the city and taking the eyeballs from his victims. The movie can boast some solid suspense sequences, and is also beautifully lit (by Dan Laustsen) and scored (by Joachim Holbek). It's got some decent gore going for it, but mostly it's all about the mood with "Nightwatch". The cast is excellent all the way down the line, with McGregor highly likable in the lead. Patricia Arquette plays his girlfriend, and figures in what is one of the best moments in the film, as she comes very close to encountering the killer. Brolin is fun as the risk taking friend, and Nick Nolte offers an interesting and entertaining performance as the police inspector on the trail of the killer. Brad Dourif has a great supporting part as the grumpy duty doctor who suggests McGregor get acquainted with drugs from the "zine" family when the latter cries wolf, Alix Koromzay is memorable as a prostitute, and Lonny Chapman has a great little bit as the veteran night watchman who trains McGregor. John C. Reilly appears uncredited in the key supporting role of Deputy Inspector Davis. The build up to the finale is so strong that the ultimate confrontation & action can't quite measure up (intriguingly, our killer is identified sooner than we'd expect), but Bornedal still does an impressive job of marrying soundtrack and image throughout his film. It gets off to a great start with its opening credits, and is fundamentally a neat little story, well told and well paced with no filler to have to deal with. It's an enjoyable film that deserves another look from genre fans. Seven out of 10.

    Well, lets just start of by saying this movie is no way near as good as the original movie "Nattevagten", of which this movie is a remake but it's still being a pretty good and fun whodunit to have a good time with. Kind of weird to notice how different this movie is in atmosphere and approach, since it actually got directed by the same director who made the original, 3 years prior to this American remake. And it's not just different but also most definitely less effective. There is not as much tension and mystery in this one, also due to some pacing issues (it's too fast paced at times) and a poor buildup to things. And all while this movie in essence is still being just like the original. Not much had been changed in its story really and I was therefore also quite surprised to find out Steven Soderbergh was involved with the writing. Guess it was an easy paycheck for him, since really not all that much had been changed or added to the movie, when compared to the original movie. While the original was being a whole lot of different things, this movie is just being a more simple and more straightforward thriller, or rather said whodunit. So really, don't expect this movie to provide you with any horror but as a mystery/thriller, I can still see this movie entertaining a whole bunch of people out there, of course especially those who aren't familiar with the original movie already. And really, the movie on its own is really being quite good and entertaining for what it is. It really doesn't handle everything well, mainly stuff concerning the earlier mentioned pacing and buildup to things but as a whole it's still being a better movie than just the average genre attempt. There are plenty of thrills and surprises in it, that help to keep you invested in the movie. It also has a cast to die for. Really an all-star cast, of which some actors are better known now days as back then. Ewan McGregor plays the main lead, while the movie further more stars Patricia Arquette, Nick Nolte, a still very young looking Josh Brolin, Brad Dourif and John C. Reilly. Not that this movie features any of their best or most interesting and challenging performances but still, it's always good to see so many talented people together on screen. A definitely good enough movie as a straightforward thriller. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I'd never heard of this movie until I saw it on Netflix instant play. Now I know why. The cast caught my eye and that is the one redeeming quality about this movie. To say that its riddled with plot holes and people doing unreasonable things simply for the sake of building tension would be an understatement. The movie is essentially one big plot hole that is held together by some decent performances and a few well shot set pieces. Josh Brolin was the best performance, but the writing negated that for reasons I won't go into so as not to spoil this for anyone who feels they have an hour and a half to burn. Evidently my review isn't long enough so I will go on to say that the writers have clearly had no experience at all with police procedures or are hoping that the viewers are oblivious. A shame really as I'm a big fan of several cast members.

    The story is a bit of a thriller clich&eacute;, unfortunately: nice guy protagonist gets mixed up in a noir-ish murder mystery, with his asshole best friend's increasingly creepy behavior triggering all sort of paranoia. However, whereas this movie ends up using a lot of clich&eacute;d tropes from the genre, I still enjoyed it a lot. For one thing, the acting is really great, and the cast is full of actors I really love. While the story is pretty straightforward, if you're a fan of the genre, you're probably pretty forgiving. What some people saw as brutal, mean-spirited, and violent, I saw as a memorably dark movie. Sure, sometimes the atmosphere comes off as a Se7en clone, but it was well-done, despite that. How much you like this movie probably depends on how tired you are of these clich&eacute;s. I can totally understand why someone would give this movie a 5/10, but I'm a bit of a junkie when it comes to thrillers. If you're looking for something new and original, you might be better off avoiding this movie.

    As I get down to my last 100 or so VHS movies that I'm transferring over to DVD, I'm going through a number of flicks that I got from my in-laws, the ones who ran a rental place for almost fifteen years. I figure, I want to see if some of this stuff is worth the effort of putting on disks. Nightwatch is not worth the 20 plus cents for the blank DVD-R. Yet, lovers of all style/all the time, blood and semen soaked gutter trash will want the collector's copy (whatever additional gore, smashed bone, and defiled corpses that might contain, I don't want to know). The only reason I stuck with this murky, incoherent, and sophomoric phlegm is that I kept waiting for Nick Nolte to rip off that ludicrous toupee he was wearing, and command . . . "Give me a f___ing drink!" I'm against being an enabler, but I think he earned this one.

    Though somewhat flawed, "Nightwatch" delivers the suspense and blood, although in the end logic flies out the window. Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as a law student with the bizarre job of guarding dead bodies in the medical examiners office. Nick Nolte plays a police detective very well, and John C. Reilly is his sidekick. In addition there is Josh Brolin as McGregor's eccentric friend, Patricia Arquette as a bewildered girlfriend, and Brad Dourif as an ultra strange doctor. The film is very creepy, unpredictable, with at least a bunch of "red herrings", and builds tension nicely. Only the somewhat rushed conclusion fails to convince. What precedes it however is highly entertaining. Recommended, although it is not for the squeamish. - MERK

    I must say that this is a fairly good movie to watch lonely at night. Must admit the fact that I haven't seen the original but based on the reviews on IMDb, the original must be too scary and better. This remade Hollywood version is not that scary but will keep you in pulse with the movie till the last scene. Some good performance from the lead casts. The movie features brutal murder scenes and nudity so strictly not for the underage or faint-hearted. Imo, the screenplay could have been made much scarier for a movie with such a storyline and the director could have held suspense a bit longer. The bottom line is -- "Not too scary still good to Night-watch"...

    A law student takes a job as the night-watch in a morgue, thinking that he will have much time to study, with his biggest problem being his paranoia. But in the history of this morgue was once a man raping female corpses, but has history really gone...... A remake of a film I've never seen, Nightwatch was supposed to be Macgregors big break into Hollywood, but 1997 was Ewan's Anu Horribilus.... The man was hot stuff after Trainspotting, Brassed Off, and Shallow Grave, but this bombed, and Hodge, Boyle, and Ewan couldn't recapture the magic with a Life Less Ordinary. So to be fair, not counting a certain pillage of a franchise, Macgregor never really got noticed in Hollywood until 2005 with The Island. Despite this films flaws, is still enjoyable, despite the fact that Brolins character should have been called Red Herring, and Arquette does very little. Macgregor plays a fresh faced student, who has it all, girlfriend, apartment, strange friend, and even stranger job. But he soon becomes prime suspect for all the murders that are happening, because dastardly Nick Nolte is setting him up, as Nolte has a history, which is heavily hinted on many occasion. Brolin is way too over the top to make you suspect him, as is Dourif, so you know from the upstart that Nolte will be the killer, which spoils the rest of the film. So apart from one very good scene involving Arquette finding a body (the whole scene is very early eighties De Palma), its all pretty generic stuff, which is a shame as now I've no interest in seeing the original, which may sound ignorant, but what's the point if you know who the killer is.....

    There are better films out there, sure, but this little hidden gem is definitely worth a watch, particularly if you like the kind of thriller that has a paranormal tint to it. McGregor is very good here (although he seems to possess the weirdest accent out there) as is Josh Brolin and Nick Nolte. The plot concerns a young man who takes the job as the night watchman at a spooky morgue. Things start to play on his mind, and as they do the bodies begin to rack up as a serial killer is on the loose. Is it McGregor? Or is his mind playing tricks on him, and if so who is the killer? Watch and see!

    I am not into horror movies where terrible events happen in someone's mind or imagination, when nothing is going on in reality (with very few exceptions like The Others); it may be interesting to watch and share the feelings, but by the end of the film you feel betrayed and disappointed. In Nightwatch, horror film elements are combined with committed crimes, and the result is not bad. McGregor, Nolte and Brolin perform especially well, female characters seem mediocre, even Arquette, but perhaps her part was not elaborated. I would have shortened the ending: when the doer becomes known, the subsequent scenes are too protracted and the horror-crime film remains a crime feature film only. But still recommended, the film is not too long and the venue (hospital morgue) has been exploited well.

    Co-writer / director Ole Bornedal's English language remake of his earlier Danish hit "Nattevagten" is pretty good stuff, a substantially atmospheric and creepy thriller that milks the ambiance of its locations for everything that they're worth. Ewan McGregor, doing a superb American accent, is law student Martin Bells, who takes a part time job as night watchman at the city morgue. His best friend James (Josh Brolin) is bored with their humdrum lives and goes about doing some reckless things, while a serial killer is haunting the city and taking the eyeballs from his victims. The movie can boast some solid suspense sequences, and is also beautifully lit (by Dan Laustsen) and scored (by Joachim Holbek). It's got some decent gore going for it, but mostly it's all about the mood with "Nightwatch". The cast is excellent all the way down the line, with McGregor highly likable in the lead. Patricia Arquette plays his girlfriend, and figures in what is one of the best moments in the film, as she comes very close to encountering the killer. Brolin is fun as the risk taking friend, and Nick Nolte offers an interesting and entertaining performance as the police inspector on the trail of the killer. Brad Dourif has a great supporting part as the grumpy duty doctor who suggests McGregor get acquainted with drugs from the "zine" family when the latter cries wolf, Alix Koromzay is memorable as a prostitute, and Lonny Chapman has a great little bit as the veteran night watchman who trains McGregor. John C. Reilly appears uncredited in the key supporting role of Deputy Inspector Davis. The build up to the finale is so strong that the ultimate confrontation & action can't quite measure up (intriguingly, our killer is identified sooner than we'd expect), but Bornedal still does an impressive job of marrying soundtrack and image throughout his film. It gets off to a great start with its opening credits, and is fundamentally a neat little story, well told and well paced with no filler to have to deal with. It's an enjoyable film that deserves another look from genre fans. Seven out of 10.

    Well, lets just start of by saying this movie is no way near as good as the original movie "Nattevagten", of which this movie is a remake but it's still being a pretty good and fun whodunit to have a good time with. Kind of weird to notice how different this movie is in atmosphere and approach, since it actually got directed by the same director who made the original, 3 years prior to this American remake. And it's not just different but also most definitely less effective. There is not as much tension and mystery in this one, also due to some pacing issues (it's too fast paced at times) and a poor buildup to things. And all while this movie in essence is still being just like the original. Not much had been changed in its story really and I was therefore also quite surprised to find out Steven Soderbergh was involved with the writing. Guess it was an easy paycheck for him, since really not all that much had been changed or added to the movie, when compared to the original movie. While the original was being a whole lot of different things, this movie is just being a more simple and more straightforward thriller, or rather said whodunit. So really, don't expect this movie to provide you with any horror but as a mystery/thriller, I can still see this movie entertaining a whole bunch of people out there, of course especially those who aren't familiar with the original movie already. And really, the movie on its own is really being quite good and entertaining for what it is. It really doesn't handle everything well, mainly stuff concerning the earlier mentioned pacing and buildup to things but as a whole it's still being a better movie than just the average genre attempt. There are plenty of thrills and surprises in it, that help to keep you invested in the movie. It also has a cast to die for. Really an all-star cast, of which some actors are better known now days as back then. Ewan McGregor plays the main lead, while the movie further more stars Patricia Arquette, Nick Nolte, a still very young looking Josh Brolin, Brad Dourif and John C. Reilly. Not that this movie features any of their best or most interesting and challenging performances but still, it's always good to see so many talented people together on screen. A definitely good enough movie as a straightforward thriller. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I'd never heard of this movie until I saw it on Netflix instant play. Now I know why. The cast caught my eye and that is the one redeeming quality about this movie. To say that its riddled with plot holes and people doing unreasonable things simply for the sake of building tension would be an understatement. The movie is essentially one big plot hole that is held together by some decent performances and a few well shot set pieces. Josh Brolin was the best performance, but the writing negated that for reasons I won't go into so as not to spoil this for anyone who feels they have an hour and a half to burn. Evidently my review isn't long enough so I will go on to say that the writers have clearly had no experience at all with police procedures or are hoping that the viewers are oblivious. A shame really as I'm a big fan of several cast members.

    The story is a bit of a thriller clich&eacute;, unfortunately: nice guy protagonist gets mixed up in a noir-ish murder mystery, with his asshole best friend's increasingly creepy behavior triggering all sort of paranoia. However, whereas this movie ends up using a lot of clich&eacute;d tropes from the genre, I still enjoyed it a lot. For one thing, the acting is really great, and the cast is full of actors I really love. While the story is pretty straightforward, if you're a fan of the genre, you're probably pretty forgiving. What some people saw as brutal, mean-spirited, and violent, I saw as a memorably dark movie. Sure, sometimes the atmosphere comes off as a Se7en clone, but it was well-done, despite that. How much you like this movie probably depends on how tired you are of these clich&eacute;s. I can totally understand why someone would give this movie a 5/10, but I'm a bit of a junkie when it comes to thrillers. If you're looking for something new and original, you might be better off avoiding this movie.

    As I get down to my last 100 or so VHS movies that I'm transferring over to DVD, I'm going through a number of flicks that I got from my in-laws, the ones who ran a rental place for almost fifteen years. I figure, I want to see if some of this stuff is worth the effort of putting on disks. Nightwatch is not worth the 20 plus cents for the blank DVD-R. Yet, lovers of all style/all the time, blood and semen soaked gutter trash will want the collector's copy (whatever additional gore, smashed bone, and defiled corpses that might contain, I don't want to know). The only reason I stuck with this murky, incoherent, and sophomoric phlegm is that I kept waiting for Nick Nolte to rip off that ludicrous toupee he was wearing, and command . . . "Give me a f___ing drink!" I'm against being an enabler, but I think he earned this one.

    Though somewhat flawed, "Nightwatch" delivers the suspense and blood, although in the end logic flies out the window. Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as a law student with the bizarre job of guarding dead bodies in the medical examiners office. Nick Nolte plays a police detective very well, and John C. Reilly is his sidekick. In addition there is Josh Brolin as McGregor's eccentric friend, Patricia Arquette as a bewildered girlfriend, and Brad Dourif as an ultra strange doctor. The film is very creepy, unpredictable, with at least a bunch of "red herrings", and builds tension nicely. Only the somewhat rushed conclusion fails to convince. What precedes it however is highly entertaining. Recommended, although it is not for the squeamish. - MERK

But he soon becomes prime suspect for all the murders that are happening, because dastardly Nick Nolte is setting him up, as Nolte has a history, which is heavily hinted on many occasion. Brolin is way too over the top to make you suspect him, as is Dourif, so you know from the upstart that Nolte will be the killer, which spoils the rest of the film. So apart from one very good scene involving Arquette finding a body (the whole scene is very early eighties De Palma), its all pretty generic stuff, which is a shame as now I've no interest in seeing the original, which may sound ignorant, but what's the point if you know who the killer is.....

    There are better films out there, sure, but this little hidden gem is definitely worth a watch, particularly if you like the kind of thriller that has a paranormal tint to it. McGregor is very good here (although he seems to possess the weirdest accent out there) as is Josh Brolin and Nick Nolte. The plot concerns a young man who takes the job as the night watchman at a spooky morgue. Things start to play on his mind, and as they do the bodies begin to rack up as a serial killer is on the loose. Is it McGregor? Or is his mind playing tricks on him, and if so who is the killer? Watch and see!

    I am not into horror movies where terrible events happen in someone's mind or imagination, when nothing is going on in reality (with very few exceptions like The Others); it may be interesting to watch and share the feelings, but by the end of the film you feel betrayed and disappointed. In Nightwatch, horror film elements are combined with committed crimes, and the result is not bad. McGregor, Nolte and Brolin perform especially well, female characters seem mediocre, even Arquette, but perhaps her part was not elaborated. I would have shortened the ending: when the doer becomes known, the subsequent scenes are too protracted and the horror-crime film remains a crime feature film only. But still recommended, the film is not too long and the venue (hospital morgue) has been exploited well.

    Co-writer / director Ole Bornedal's English language remake of his earlier Danish hit "Nattevagten" is pretty good stuff, a substantially atmospheric and creepy thriller that milks the ambiance of its locations for everything that they're worth. Ewan McGregor, doing a superb American accent, is law student Martin Bells, who takes a part time job as night watchman at the city morgue. His best friend James (Josh Brolin) is bored with their humdrum lives and goes about doing some reckless things, while a serial killer is haunting the city and taking the eyeballs from his victims. The movie can boast some solid suspense sequences, and is also beautifully lit (by Dan Laustsen) and scored (by Joachim Holbek). It's got some decent gore going for it, but mostly it's all about the mood with "Nightwatch". The cast is excellent all the way down the line, with McGregor highly likable in the lead. Patricia Arquette plays his girlfriend, and figures in what is one of the best moments in the film, as she comes very close to encountering the killer. Brolin is fun as the risk taking friend, and Nick Nolte offers an interesting and entertaining performance as the police inspector on the trail of the killer. Brad Dourif has a great supporting part as the grumpy duty doctor who suggests McGregor get acquainted with drugs from the "zine" family when the latter cries wolf, Alix Koromzay is memorable as a prostitute, and Lonny Chapman has a great little bit as the veteran night watchman who trains McGregor. John C. Reilly appears uncredited in the key supporting role of Deputy Inspector Davis. The build up to the finale is so strong that the ultimate confrontation & action can't quite measure up (intriguingly, our killer is identified sooner than we'd expect), but Bornedal still does an impressive job of marrying soundtrack and image throughout his film. It gets off to a great start with its opening credits, and is fundamentally a neat little story, well told and well paced with no filler to have to deal with. It's an enjoyable film that deserves another look from genre fans. Seven out of 10.

    Well, lets just start of by saying this movie is no way near as good as the original movie "Nattevagten", of which this movie is a remake but it's still being a pretty good and fun whodunit to have a good time with. Kind of weird to notice how different this movie is in atmosphere and approach, since it actually got directed by the same director who made the original, 3 years prior to this American remake. And it's not just different but also most definitely less effective. There is not as much tension and mystery in this one, also due to some pacing issues (it's too fast paced at times) and a poor buildup to things. And all while this movie in essence is still being just like the original. Not much had been changed in its story really and I was therefore also quite surprised to find out Steven Soderbergh was involved with the writing. Guess it was an easy paycheck for him, since really not all that much had been changed or added to the movie, when compared to the original movie. While the original was being a whole lot of different things, this movie is just being a more simple and more straightforward thriller, or rather said whodunit. So really, don't expect this movie to provide you with any horror but as a mystery/thriller, I can still see this movie entertaining a whole bunch of people out there, of course especially those who aren't familiar with the original movie already. And really, the movie on its own is really being quite good and entertaining for what it is. It really doesn't handle everything well, mainly stuff concerning the earlier mentioned pacing and buildup to things but as a whole it's still being a better movie than just the average genre attempt. There are plenty of thrills and surprises in it, that help to keep you invested in the movie. It also has a cast to die for. Really an all-star cast, of which some actors are better known now days as back then. Ewan McGregor plays the main lead, while the movie further more stars Patricia Arquette, Nick Nolte, a still very young looking Josh Brolin, Brad Dourif and John C. Reilly. Not that this movie features any of their best or most interesting and challenging performances but still, it's always good to see so many talented people together on screen. A definitely good enough movie as a straightforward thriller. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I'd never heard of this movie until I saw it on Netflix instant play. Now I know why. The cast caught my eye and that is the one redeeming quality about this movie. To say that its riddled with plot holes and people doing unreasonable things simply for the sake of building tension would be an understatement. The movie is essentially one big plot hole that is held together by some decent performances and a few well shot set pieces. Josh Brolin was the best performance, but the writing negated that for reasons I won't go into so as not to spoil this for anyone who feels they have an hour and a half to burn. Evidently my review isn't long enough so I will go on to say that the writers have clearly had no experience at all with police procedures or are hoping that the viewers are oblivious. A shame really as I'm a big fan of several cast members.

    The story is a bit of a thriller clich&eacute;, unfortunately: nice guy protagonist gets mixed up in a noir-ish murder mystery, with his asshole best friend's increasingly creepy behavior triggering all sort of paranoia. However, whereas this movie ends up using a lot of clich&eacute;d tropes from the genre, I still enjoyed it a lot. For one thing, the acting is really great, and the cast is full of actors I really love. While the story is pretty straightforward, if you're a fan of the genre, you're probably pretty forgiving. What some people saw as brutal, mean-spirited, and violent, I saw as a memorably dark movie. Sure, sometimes the atmosphere comes off as a Se7en clone, but it was well-done, despite that. How much you like this movie probably depends on how tired you are of these clich&eacute;s. I can totally understand why someone would give this movie a 5/10, but I'm a bit of a junkie when it comes to thrillers. If you're looking for something new and original, you might be better off avoiding this movie.

    As I get down to my last 100 or so VHS movies that I'm transferring over to DVD, I'm going through a number of flicks that I got from my in-laws, the ones who ran a rental place for almost fifteen years. I figure, I want to see if some of this stuff is worth the effort of putting on disks. Nightwatch is not worth the 20 plus cents for the blank DVD-R. Yet, lovers of all style/all the time, blood and semen soaked gutter trash will want the collector's copy (whatever additional gore, smashed bone, and defiled corpses that might contain, I don't want to know). The only reason I stuck with this murky, incoherent, and sophomoric phlegm is that I kept waiting for Nick Nolte to rip off that ludicrous toupee he was wearing, and command . . . "Give me a f___ing drink!" I'm against being an enabler, but I think he earned this one.

    Though somewhat flawed, "Nightwatch" delivers the suspense and blood, although in the end logic flies out the window. Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as a law student with the bizarre job of guarding dead bodies in the medical examiners office. Nick Nolte plays a police detective very well, and John C. Reilly is his sidekick. In addition there is Josh Brolin as McGregor's eccentric friend, Patricia Arquette as a bewildered girlfriend, and Brad Dourif as an ultra strange doctor. The film is very creepy, unpredictable, with at least a bunch of "red herrings", and builds tension nicely. Only the somewhat rushed conclusion fails to convince. What precedes it however is highly entertaining. Recommended, although it is not for the squeamish. - MERK

    I must say that this is a fairly good movie to watch lonely at night. Must admit the fact that I haven't seen the original but based on the reviews on IMDb, the original must be too scary and better. This remade Hollywood version is not that scary but will keep you in pulse with the movie till the last scene. Some good performance from the lead casts. The movie features brutal murder scenes and nudity so strictly not for the underage or faint-hearted. Imo, the screenplay could have been made much scarier for a movie with such a storyline and the director could have held suspense a bit longer. The bottom line is -- "Not too scary still good to Night-watch"...

    A law student takes a job as the night-watch in a morgue, thinking that he will have much time to study, with his biggest problem being his paranoia. But in the history of this morgue was once a man raping female corpses, but has history really gone...... A remake of a film I've never seen, Nightwatch was supposed to be Macgregors big break into Hollywood, but 1997 was Ewan's Anu Horribilus.... The man was hot stuff after Trainspotting, Brassed Off, and Shallow Grave, but this bombed, and Hodge, Boyle, and Ewan couldn't recapture the magic with a Life Less Ordinary. So to be fair, not counting a certain pillage of a franchise, Macgregor never really got noticed in Hollywood until 2005 with The Island. Despite this films flaws, is still enjoyable, despite the fact that Brolins character should have been called Red Herring, and Arquette does very little.

    I am not into horror movies where terrible events happen in someone's mind or imagination, when nothing is going on in reality (with very few exceptions like The Others); it may be interesting to watch and share the feelings, but by the end of the film you feel betrayed and disappointed. In Nightwatch, horror film elements are combined with committed crimes, and the result is not bad. McGregor, Nolte and Brolin perform especially well, female characters seem mediocre, even Arquette, but perhaps her part was not elaborated. I would have shortened the ending: when the doer becomes known, the subsequent scenes are too protracted and the horror-crime film remains a crime feature film only. But still recommended, the film is not too long and the venue (hospital morgue) has been exploited well.

    Co-writer / director Ole Bornedal's English language remake of his earlier Danish hit "Nattevagten" is pretty good stuff, a substantially atmospheric and creepy thriller that milks the ambiance of its locations for everything that they're worth. Ewan McGregor, doing a superb American accent, is law student Martin Bells, who takes a part time job as night watchman at the city morgue. His best friend James (Josh Brolin) is bored with their humdrum lives and goes about doing some reckless things, while a serial killer is haunting the city and taking the eyeballs from his victims. The movie can boast some solid suspense sequences, and is also beautifully lit (by Dan Laustsen) and scored (by Joachim Holbek). It's got some decent gore going for it, but mostly it's all about the mood with "Nightwatch". The cast is excellent all the way down the line, with McGregor highly likable in the lead. Patricia Arquette plays his girlfriend, and figures in what is one of the best moments in the film, as she comes very close to encountering the killer. Brolin is fun as the risk taking friend, and Nick Nolte offers an interesting and entertaining performance as the police inspector on the trail of the killer. Brad Dourif has a great supporting part as the grumpy duty doctor who suggests McGregor get acquainted with drugs from the "zine" family when the latter cries wolf, Alix Koromzay is memorable as a prostitute, and Lonny Chapman has a great little bit as the veteran night watchman who trains McGregor. John C. Reilly appears uncredited in the key supporting role of Deputy Inspector Davis. The build up to the finale is so strong that the ultimate confrontation & action can't quite measure up (intriguingly, our killer is identified sooner than we'd expect), but Bornedal still does an impressive job of marrying soundtrack and image throughout his film. It gets off to a great start with its opening credits, and is fundamentally a neat little story, well told and well paced with no filler to have to deal with. It's an enjoyable film that deserves another look from genre fans. Seven out of 10.

    Well, lets just start of by saying this movie is no way near as good as the original movie "Nattevagten", of which this movie is a remake but it's still being a pretty good and fun whodunit to have a good time with. Kind of weird to notice how different this movie is in atmosphere and approach, since it actually got directed by the same director who made the original, 3 years prior to this American remake. And it's not just different but also most definitely less effective. There is not as much tension and mystery in this one, also due to some pacing issues (it's too fast paced at times) and a poor buildup to things. And all while this movie in essence is still being just like the original. Not much had been changed in its story really and I was therefore also quite surprised to find out Steven Soderbergh was involved with the writing. Guess it was an easy paycheck for him, since really not all that much had been changed or added to the movie, when compared to the original movie. While the original was being a whole lot of different things, this movie is just being a more simple and more straightforward thriller, or rather said whodunit. So really, don't expect this movie to provide you with any horror but as a mystery/thriller, I can still see this movie entertaining a whole bunch of people out there, of course especially those who aren't familiar with the original movie already. And really, the movie on its own is really being quite good and entertaining for what it is. It really doesn't handle everything well, mainly stuff concerning the earlier mentioned pacing and buildup to things but as a whole it's still being a better movie than just the average genre attempt. There are plenty of thrills and surprises in it, that help to keep you invested in the movie. It also has a cast to die for. Really an all-star cast, of which some actors are better known now days as back then. Ewan McGregor plays the main lead, while the movie further more stars Patricia Arquette, Nick Nolte, a still very young looking Josh Brolin, Brad Dourif and John C. Reilly. Not that this movie features any of their best or most interesting and challenging performances but still, it's always good to see so many talented people together on screen. A definitely good enough movie as a straightforward thriller. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I'd never heard of this movie until I saw it on Netflix instant play. Now I know why. The cast caught my eye and that is the one redeeming quality about this movie. To say that its riddled with plot holes and people doing unreasonable things simply for the sake of building tension would be an understatement. The movie is essentially one big plot hole that is held together by some decent performances and a few well shot set pieces. Josh Brolin was the best performance, but the writing negated that for reasons I won't go into so as not to spoil this for anyone who feels they have an hour and a half to burn. Evidently my review isn't long enough so I will go on to say that the writers have clearly had no experience at all with police procedures or are hoping that the viewers are oblivious. A shame really as I'm a big fan of several cast members.

    The story is a bit of a thriller clich&eacute;, unfortunately: nice guy protagonist gets mixed up in a noir-ish murder mystery, with his asshole best friend's increasingly creepy behavior triggering all sort of paranoia. However, whereas this movie ends up using a lot of clich&eacute;d tropes from the genre, I still enjoyed it a lot. For one thing, the acting is really great, and the cast is full of actors I really love. While the story is pretty straightforward, if you're a fan of the genre, you're probably pretty forgiving. What some people saw as brutal, mean-spirited, and violent, I saw as a memorably dark movie. Sure, sometimes the atmosphere comes off as a Se7en clone, but it was well-done, despite that. How much you like this movie probably depends on how tired you are of these clich&eacute;s. I can totally understand why someone would give this movie a 5/10, but I'm a bit of a junkie when it comes to thrillers. If you're looking for something new and original, you might be better off avoiding this movie.

    As I get down to my last 100 or so VHS movies that I'm transferring over to DVD, I'm going through a number of flicks that I got from my in-laws, the ones who ran a rental place for almost fifteen years. I figure, I want to see if some of this stuff is worth the effort of putting on disks. Nightwatch is not worth the 20 plus cents for the blank DVD-R. Yet, lovers of all style/all the time, blood and semen soaked gutter trash will want the collector's copy (whatever additional gore, smashed bone, and defiled corpses that might contain, I don't want to know). The only reason I stuck with this murky, incoherent, and sophomoric phlegm is that I kept waiting for Nick Nolte to rip off that ludicrous toupee he was wearing, and command . . . "Give me a f___ing drink!" I'm against being an enabler, but I think he earned this one.

    Though somewhat flawed, "Nightwatch" delivers the suspense and blood, although in the end logic flies out the window. Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as a law student with the bizarre job of guarding dead bodies in the medical examiners office. Nick Nolte plays a police detective very well, and John C. Reilly is his sidekick. In addition there is Josh Brolin as McGregor's eccentric friend, Patricia Arquette as a bewildered girlfriend, and Brad Dourif as an ultra strange doctor. The film is very creepy, unpredictable, with at least a bunch of "red herrings", and builds tension nicely. Only the somewhat rushed conclusion fails to convince. What precedes it however is highly entertaining. Recommended, although it is not for the squeamish. - MERK

    I must say that this is a fairly good movie to watch lonely at night. Must admit the fact that I haven't seen the original but based on the reviews on IMDb, the original must be too scary and better. This remade Hollywood version is not that scary but will keep you in pulse with the movie till the last scene. Some good performance from the lead casts. The movie features brutal murder scenes and nudity so strictly not for the underage or faint-hearted. Imo, the screenplay could have been made much scarier for a movie with such a storyline and the director could have held suspense a bit longer. The bottom line is -- "Not too scary still good to Night-watch"...

    A law student takes a job as the night-watch in a morgue, thinking that he will have much time to study, with his biggest problem being his paranoia. But in the history of this morgue was once a man raping female corpses, but has history really gone...... A remake of a film I've never seen, Nightwatch was supposed to be Macgregors big break into Hollywood, but 1997 was Ewan's Anu Horribilus.... The man was hot stuff after Trainspotting, Brassed Off, and Shallow Grave, but this bombed, and Hodge, Boyle, and Ewan couldn't recapture the magic with a Life Less Ordinary. So to be fair, not counting a certain pillage of a franchise, Macgregor never really got noticed in Hollywood until 2005 with The Island. Despite this films flaws, is still enjoyable, despite the fact that Brolins character should have been called Red Herring, and Arquette does very little. Macgregor plays a fresh faced student, who has it all, girlfriend, apartment, strange friend, and even stranger job. But he soon becomes prime suspect for all the murders that are happening, because dastardly Nick Nolte is setting him up, as Nolte has a history, which is heavily hinted on many occasion. Brolin is way too over the top to make you suspect him, as is Dourif, so you know from the upstart that Nolte will be the killer, which spoils the rest of the film. So apart from one very good scene involving Arquette finding a body (the whole scene is very early eighties De Palma), its all pretty generic stuff, which is a shame as now I've no interest in seeing the original, which may sound ignorant, but what's the point if you know who the killer is.....

    There are better films out there, sure, but this little hidden gem is definitely worth a watch, particularly if you like the kind of thriller that has a paranormal tint to it. McGregor is very good here (although he seems to possess the weirdest accent out there) as is Josh Brolin and Nick Nolte. The plot concerns a young man who takes the job as the night watchman at a spooky morgue. Things start to play on his mind, and as they do the bodies begin to rack up as a serial killer is on the loose. Is it McGregor? Or is his mind playing tricks on him, and if so who is the killer? Watch and see!

Brad Dourif has a great supporting part as the grumpy duty doctor who suggests McGregor get acquainted with drugs from the "zine" family when the latter cries wolf, Alix Koromzay is memorable as a prostitute, and Lonny Chapman has a great little bit as the veteran night watchman who trains McGregor. John C. Reilly appears uncredited in the key supporting role of Deputy Inspector Davis. The build up to the finale is so strong that the ultimate confrontation & action can't quite measure up (intriguingly, our killer is identified sooner than we'd expect), but Bornedal still does an impressive job of marrying soundtrack and image throughout his film. It gets off to a great start with its opening credits, and is fundamentally a neat little story, well told and well paced with no filler to have to deal with. It's an enjoyable film that deserves another look from genre fans. Seven out of 10.

    Well, lets just start of by saying this movie is no way near as good as the original movie "Nattevagten", of which this movie is a remake but it's still being a pretty good and fun whodunit to have a good time with. Kind of weird to notice how different this movie is in atmosphere and approach, since it actually got directed by the same director who made the original, 3 years prior to this American remake. And it's not just different but also most definitely less effective. There is not as much tension and mystery in this one, also due to some pacing issues (it's too fast paced at times) and a poor buildup to things. And all while this movie in essence is still being just like the original. Not much had been changed in its story really and I was therefore also quite surprised to find out Steven Soderbergh was involved with the writing. Guess it was an easy paycheck for him, since really not all that much had been changed or added to the movie, when compared to the original movie. While the original was being a whole lot of different things, this movie is just being a more simple and more straightforward thriller, or rather said whodunit. So really, don't expect this movie to provide you with any horror but as a mystery/thriller, I can still see this movie entertaining a whole bunch of people out there, of course especially those who aren't familiar with the original movie already. And really, the movie on its own is really being quite good and entertaining for what it is. It really doesn't handle everything well, mainly stuff concerning the earlier mentioned pacing and buildup to things but as a whole it's still being a better movie than just the average genre attempt. There are plenty of thrills and surprises in it, that help to keep you invested in the movie. It also has a cast to die for. Really an all-star cast, of which some actors are better known now days as back then. Ewan McGregor plays the main lead, while the movie further more stars Patricia Arquette, Nick Nolte, a still very young looking Josh Brolin, Brad Dourif and John C. Reilly. Not that this movie features any of their best or most interesting and challenging performances but still, it's always good to see so many talented people together on screen. A definitely good enough movie as a straightforward thriller. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I'd never heard of this movie until I saw it on Netflix instant play. Now I know why. The cast caught my eye and that is the one redeeming quality about this movie. To say that its riddled with plot holes and people doing unreasonable things simply for the sake of building tension would be an understatement. The movie is essentially one big plot hole that is held together by some decent performances and a few well shot set pieces. Josh Brolin was the best performance, but the writing negated that for reasons I won't go into so as not to spoil this for anyone who feels they have an hour and a half to burn. Evidently my review isn't long enough so I will go on to say that the writers have clearly had no experience at all with police procedures or are hoping that the viewers are oblivious. A shame really as I'm a big fan of several cast members.

    The story is a bit of a thriller clich&eacute;, unfortunately: nice guy protagonist gets mixed up in a noir-ish murder mystery, with his asshole best friend's increasingly creepy behavior triggering all sort of paranoia. However, whereas this movie ends up using a lot of clich&eacute;d tropes from the genre, I still enjoyed it a lot. For one thing, the acting is really great, and the cast is full of actors I really love. While the story is pretty straightforward, if you're a fan of the genre, you're probably pretty forgiving. What some people saw as brutal, mean-spirited, and violent, I saw as a memorably dark movie. Sure, sometimes the atmosphere comes off as a Se7en clone, but it was well-done, despite that. How much you like this movie probably depends on how tired you are of these clich&eacute;s. I can totally understand why someone would give this movie a 5/10, but I'm a bit of a junkie when it comes to thrillers. If you're looking for something new and original, you might be better off avoiding this movie.

    As I get down to my last 100 or so VHS movies that I'm transferring over to DVD, I'm going through a number of flicks that I got from my in-laws, the ones who ran a rental place for almost fifteen years. I figure, I want to see if some of this stuff is worth the effort of putting on disks. Nightwatch is not worth the 20 plus cents for the blank DVD-R. Yet, lovers of all style/all the time, blood and semen soaked gutter trash will want the collector's copy (whatever additional gore, smashed bone, and defiled corpses that might contain, I don't want to know). The only reason I stuck with this murky, incoherent, and sophomoric phlegm is that I kept waiting for Nick Nolte to rip off that ludicrous toupee he was wearing, and command . . . "Give me a f___ing drink!" I'm against being an enabler, but I think he earned this one.

    Though somewhat flawed, "Nightwatch" delivers the suspense and blood, although in the end logic flies out the window. Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as a law student with the bizarre job of guarding dead bodies in the medical examiners office. Nick Nolte plays a police detective very well, and John C. Reilly is his sidekick. In addition there is Josh Brolin as McGregor's eccentric friend, Patricia Arquette as a bewildered girlfriend, and Brad Dourif as an ultra strange doctor. The film is very creepy, unpredictable, with at least a bunch of "red herrings", and builds tension nicely. Only the somewhat rushed conclusion fails to convince. What precedes it however is highly entertaining. Recommended, although it is not for the squeamish. - MERK

    I must say that this is a fairly good movie to watch lonely at night. Must admit the fact that I haven't seen the original but based on the reviews on IMDb, the original must be too scary and better. This remade Hollywood version is not that scary but will keep you in pulse with the movie till the last scene. Some good performance from the lead casts. The movie features brutal murder scenes and nudity so strictly not for the underage or faint-hearted. Imo, the screenplay could have been made much scarier for a movie with such a storyline and the director could have held suspense a bit longer. The bottom line is -- "Not too scary still good to Night-watch"...

    A law student takes a job as the night-watch in a morgue, thinking that he will have much time to study, with his biggest problem being his paranoia. But in the history of this morgue was once a man raping female corpses, but has history really gone...... A remake of a film I've never seen, Nightwatch was supposed to be Macgregors big break into Hollywood, but 1997 was Ewan's Anu Horribilus.... The man was hot stuff after Trainspotting, Brassed Off, and Shallow Grave, but this bombed, and Hodge, Boyle, and Ewan couldn't recapture the magic with a Life Less Ordinary. So to be fair, not counting a certain pillage of a franchise, Macgregor never really got noticed in Hollywood until 2005 with The Island. Despite this films flaws, is still enjoyable, despite the fact that Brolins character should have been called Red Herring, and Arquette does very little. Macgregor plays a fresh faced student, who has it all, girlfriend, apartment, strange friend, and even stranger job. But he soon becomes prime suspect for all the murders that are happening, because dastardly Nick Nolte is setting him up, as Nolte has a history, which is heavily hinted on many occasion. Brolin is way too over the top to make you suspect him, as is Dourif, so you know from the upstart that Nolte will be the killer, which spoils the rest of the film. So apart from one very good scene involving Arquette finding a body (the whole scene is very early eighties De Palma), its all pretty generic stuff, which is a shame as now I've no interest in seeing the original, which may sound ignorant, but what's the point if you know who the killer is.....

    There are better films out there, sure, but this little hidden gem is definitely worth a watch, particularly if you like the kind of thriller that has a paranormal tint to it. McGregor is very good here (although he seems to possess the weirdest accent out there) as is Josh Brolin and Nick Nolte. The plot concerns a young man who takes the job as the night watchman at a spooky morgue. Things start to play on his mind, and as they do the bodies begin to rack up as a serial killer is on the loose. Is it McGregor? Or is his mind playing tricks on him, and if so who is the killer? Watch and see!

    I am not into horror movies where terrible events happen in someone's mind or imagination, when nothing is going on in reality (with very few exceptions like The Others); it may be interesting to watch and share the feelings, but by the end of the film you feel betrayed and disappointed. In Nightwatch, horror film elements are combined with committed crimes, and the result is not bad. McGregor, Nolte and Brolin perform especially well, female characters seem mediocre, even Arquette, but perhaps her part was not elaborated. I would have shortened the ending: when the doer becomes known, the subsequent scenes are too protracted and the horror-crime film remains a crime feature film only. But still recommended, the film is not too long and the venue (hospital morgue) has been exploited well.

    Co-writer / director Ole Bornedal's English language remake of his earlier Danish hit "Nattevagten" is pretty good stuff, a substantially atmospheric and creepy thriller that milks the ambiance of its locations for everything that they're worth. Ewan McGregor, doing a superb American accent, is law student Martin Bells, who takes a part time job as night watchman at the city morgue. His best friend James (Josh Brolin) is bored with their humdrum lives and goes about doing some reckless things, while a serial killer is haunting the city and taking the eyeballs from his victims. The movie can boast some solid suspense sequences, and is also beautifully lit (by Dan Laustsen) and scored (by Joachim Holbek). It's got some decent gore going for it, but mostly it's all about the mood with "Nightwatch". The cast is excellent all the way down the line, with McGregor highly likable in the lead. Patricia Arquette plays his girlfriend, and figures in what is one of the best moments in the film, as she comes very close to encountering the killer. Brolin is fun as the risk taking friend, and Nick Nolte offers an interesting and entertaining performance as the police inspector on the trail of the killer. Brad Dourif has a great supporting part as the grumpy duty doctor who suggests McGregor get acquainted with drugs from the "zine" family when the latter cries wolf, Alix Koromzay is memorable as a prostitute, and Lonny Chapman has a great little bit as the veteran night watchman who trains McGregor. John C. Reilly appears uncredited in the key supporting role of Deputy Inspector Davis. The build up to the finale is so strong that the ultimate confrontation & action can't quite measure up (intriguingly, our killer is identified sooner than we'd expect), but Bornedal still does an impressive job of marrying soundtrack and image throughout his film. It gets off to a great start with its opening credits, and is fundamentally a neat little story, well told and well paced with no filler to have to deal with.
