    A stern Russian woman (Greta Garbo) sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man (Melvyn Douglas) who represents everything she is supposed to detest. The way Soviet Russia is portrayed here is quite strange. We have Ninotchka saying an old man looks "sad" and should not be working, she has a strict adherence to custom and regulation. And censorship completely blocks out the letters of friends. While I do not think this is completely off-base, surely this is exaggerated. (Of course, in some ways, the situation was probably far worse.) I love that this has a Billy Wilder script. Wilder learned a lot from director Lubitsch and went on to direct some of the greatest films out there (I would argue that Wilder surpassed Lubitsch in greatness). We also get a great appearance (although all too small) of the legendary Bela Lugosi.

    From director Ernst Lubitsch (To Be or Not to Be, Heaven Can Wait), I had heard the leading actress name a few times, I didn't know much about her, especially not that she retired at the age of thirty five after only twenty eight films, and I was looking forward to this title I recognised from her career. Basically in Paris, France, three Russians, Iranov (Sig Ruman), Buljanov (Felix Bressart) and Kopalsky (Alexander Granach), are selling jewellery from the aristocracy that they confiscated during the 1917 Russian Revolution, and arriving they meet Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) who is trying to retrieve her jewellery back for Russian Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire). But he corrupts the three men and convinces them to stay in Paris since they have become accustomed to their French surroundings, so special diplomatic agent Nina Ivanovna "Ninotchka" Yakushova (Oscar nominated Greta Garbo) has been sent by the Soviet Union to make sure the sale goes ahead and bring the three men back to Russia. She is stern and non nonsense with her attitude, and for a while she has no time to mess around with pleasure rather than business, but after meeting Leon and being introduced more to the culture of the West she lightens up. Ninotchka and Leon slowly fall in love with each other, and this allows the three Russians to do a kindness for capitalism, and in the end the Russian agent leaves behind her work to have a relationship with the Count, and one of the three men protects that the other two were unfair to him, this is a joke. Also starring Bela Lugosi as Commissar Razinin and Gregory Gaye as Count Alexis Rakonin. Garbo gives a great performance as the first strict and then light-hearted Russian agent, and Douglas is likable as the charming man and love interest, I will confess that I could not understand the political stuff and I could not follow everything going on, but I did laugh when the jokes were simple and well made, the most funny material is during the caf&eacute; scene, and the love story is nice, so it was an fun sophisticated comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Writing, Original Story and Best Writing, Screenplay. Greta Garbo was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 44 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 52 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    NINOTCHKA (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, ranks one of the finest comedies to emerge in what's regarded to be Hollywood's greatest year, 1939. It was also that very year where certain top-rated stars, having gone through a declining period, would recapture the status they once acquired some time ago. The legendary Greta Garbo happened to be one of them. After playing tragic heroines for MGM dating back to the silent era of 1926, it was time for Garbo to either retire following her last screen appearance of CONQUEST (1937), or do something completely different. A Garbo musical might have been interesting, but quite unlikely. A western? Not quite. Garbo in pistols and petticoats would definitely not be her style, though it did work for Marlene Dietrich in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN. A murder mystery? Perhaps. Or at least another love story might suffice? The next best thing to reinventing the Garbo image turned out to be a comedy. Screwball comedies were highly successful and common place during the latter half of the thirties. For this comedy, however, it had to be both funny and agreeable to public taste. Funny and agreeable it was. Under stylish direction from the man known for his "Lubitsch touch," and excellent scripting by Charles Bracket, Billy Wilder and Walter Reich, the comedy in question resulted to the title character bearing the Russian name of NINOTCHKA. Opening title: "This picture takes place in Paris in those wonderful days when a siren was a brunette and not an alarm - and if a Frenchman turns out the light, it was not on account of an air raid!" The story opens with Russian comrades, Buljanoff (Felix Bressart), Iranoff (Sig Rumann) and Kopakski (Alexander Granach), in Paris, on a mission from the Soviet Government to sell jewels once belonging to the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) with the money used for farm machinery. Their assignment is soon forgotten as the trio enjoy themselves in the company of beautiful barmaids. Also at the luxurious hotel is Alexis Rakonin (Gregory Gaye), a Russian count posing as a waiter, who informs the Grand Duchess of their activities. Swana then has her lover, Count Leon D'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), to assist by both filing a court injunction to prevent the selling of the jewels as well as showing the comrades a good time in order to forget why they're in Paris in the first place. Due to the long delay, the Soviet sends Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, better known as Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), to investigate. Having met Ninotchka at a crosswalk, Leon, unaware of her identity, immediately becomes fascinated by her. During her stay in Paris, Leon does everything to entertain her, from escorting her to the top of the Eiffel Tower to endless attempts in trying to make her laugh. When Ninotchka finally transforms into a new woman, trading her beret for a modern hat, she, too, forgets her assignment by concentrating on Leon. When Ninotchka mysteriously returns to Russia, Leon tries to follow her there, but is unable to obtain a Visa. For Garbo's introduction in American comedy, NINOTCHKA comes no better than this. She earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for her performance. What makes NINOTCHKA work so well is the way Garbo delivers her comedy lines, in the same manner of her dramatic roles. Enacting it in a straightforward manner with no attempts of being funny is the secret to the hilarity. The more serious she is, the funnier she becomes. Of the many classic lines delivered here, with one being a little "in-joke" pertaining to Garbo's classic tag line of "wanting to be alone," the one that should get honorable mention is, "Do you want to see my wound." For Garbo's male co-star, Melvyn Douglas proved to be a most logical choice. His most classic scene comes as he helps his leading lady fulfill her much publicized slogan, "Garbo laughs!" She's laughed before on screen, but never so hysterically. A pity the Garbo-Douglas reunion comedy of TWO FACED WOMAN (1941) didn't earn the same reputation as NINOTCHKA. The now forgotten Ina Claire, better known more for her theatrical than screen performances, gives a good account of herself as the Duchess. It's a wonder how the sophisticated Genevieve Tobin might have done had she assumed that very same role. Horror movie fans will be surprised in finding the fourth-billed Bela Lugosi appearing as the Russian Commissar Razinin. Even more surprising how his one and only scene opposite Garbo to not only come very late into the 111 minute story, but one lasting a little less three minutes! As much as NINOTCHKA has been imitated and recycled throughout the years, only the musical remake, SILK STOCKINGS (MGM, 1957) starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse (Ninotchka) comes close in recapturing the success of the original. Distributed to video cassette in the mid 1980s and later onto DVD, viewers can capture a glimpse of the legendary Garbo laughing (and showing off her wound) in one of cable TV's many broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies.

    My only other experience of Garbo was in the 1925 silent film "The Joyless Street", a rather somber picture that featured her charisma with strong body language and facial expressiveness. Apparently the tag line 'Garbo Laughs' was meant to convey a change in character from her ensuing screen roles, but it takes a while to get there. It's only when her charmingly aggressive suitor (Melvyn Douglas) falls out of his chair that the stuffy Nina Ivanova Yakushova breaks character and reveals a human being underneath a commissar's clothing. The film is billed as a comedy, but it's not of the laugh out loud variety. The film delivers it's humor in the witty dialog between Garbo and Douglas, along with the calculated antics of the three apparatchiks Ninotchka has been sent to spy on and see that their mission is successful. I don't know if the title 'Envoy Extraordinaire" was a legitimate one, but Garbo takes it seriously, to the point of declining a railroad porter to take her bags, citing the 'social injustice' of it all. There are a handful of these ideological viewpoints woven into the script; another was Ninotchka's observation that as a capitalist, Douglas's Leon D'Algout was the product of a doomed culture. Personally, I enjoyed the film, though I had a sense that it started to drag at the ninety minute mark or so. The resolution of the romance between Ninotchka and Leon would have required the Russian comrade to defect so in that respect it seemed somewhat contrived. But not any more so than having the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) simply give away here jeweled fortune to entice her rival away from Paris.

    Ninotchka (1939) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Terrific romantic-comedy about a stern Russian named Ninotchka (Greta Garbo) who is sent to Paris to look in on three men who were unable to sell some jewelry due to some legal issues. Once there Ninotchka strikes up a relationship with Leon (Melvyn Douglas) who has his own reasons for wanting the jewels. Director Ernst Lubitsch hits all the right moves with this film and turns it into one of the best of its type. It's easy to see why so many people consider 1939 to be the greatest year for movies and this one here is another one of the jewels from that era. Although I'd stop short of calling this a masterpiece, there's still no question that it features a legend at the top of her game and a terrific supporting cast around her. It's funny to see the original advertisements talk about Garbo laughing since this was a very rare thing. Just like her first talking picture, which MGM played up, the moment here when she finally laughs is just a classic scene and one of the most memorable. There are so many classic moments in this film but the majority of the credit has to go to Garbo who is simply wonderful. The stern way she plays this character is just so funny and her line deliveries are flawless. When it comes time for the character to break and have some fun the actress pulls this off remarkably well. It also helps that Douglas is so great in the film and perfectly plays off the actress. Ina Claire, Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, Alexander Granach and Bela Lugosi are also very good in their supporting parts. NINOTCHKA is full of wonderfully funny moments from start to finish and it's easy to see why it's considered such a classic of its genre.

    A stern Russian woman sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man who represents everything she is supposed to detest. In her second last movie, Greta Garbo plays the title character, and in doing so, she exceeds thoroughly. Ninotchka is a hilarious and laugh-filled romantic comedy, and one of Garbo's best. I saw this movie a very long time ago, and I watched it again recently because I didn't remember it that much, and when I watched it again, I certainly had a fun time, as I was laughing quite a lot. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas were superb in their roles, and not only that, but there was also a good amount of chemistry between the two, they were perfect, I don't know if I can think of anybody who could have done a better job than they did. This movie is a comedy masterpiece, it's one of the best comedies of all time, and one of the best movies of the 1930's! There are big laughs in this movie, as well as many passions, and of course, there is what you'd expect to see in a great movie like this, great writing, great directing, and especially, great acting! Sadly, after making one more movie, Greta Garbo would retire from acting. Melvyn Douglas however, would go on to further greatness. In 1963, he would win is first Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Hud, and then in 1979, he would win his second Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Being There. In addition to Garbo and Douglas, the supporting cast is also noteworthy, the two biggest examples are Bela Lugosi (who as you know, is famous for playing Dracula, and being in a lot of Ed Wood's movies later in his career) and Sig Ruman (who appeared in White Christmas, Stalag 17, and numerous movies with the Marx Brothers). But as you might have already known, the best ones in the movie are of course, Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, especially the former. It's a pity that Garbo retired soon after this, as she was one of the few actresses who was successful after the era of silent movies. Ninotchka is the perfect romantic comedy to spend one hour and fifty minutes watching, as it's got exactly what you would expect to see in a great romantic comedy, laughs, passions, great directing, great acting, and great writing. There are a lot of funny scenes, such as the restaurant scene and the ending (which I am not going to say what it is because it would spoil things), not to mention the part where they climb up the Eiffel Tower. So if you are looking for a great romantic comedy to watch and laugh at, then join Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas for 1939's Ninotchka, which is yet another great movie released in what many people consider to be the greatest year for movies. And by the way, the script of this movie was co-written by Billy Wilder, who would later write and direct classics like The Lost Weekend, The Apartment, Stalag 17, and The Fortune Cookie. In short, Ninotchka is a great comedy, one somebody watches it, it will be impossible for them not to laugh at least once. 10/10

    "Ninotchka" is one of the funniest movies ever made. But it's not a slapstick or screwball comedy. It is in the class of "It Happened One Night," "My Man Godfry," and "Holiday." The humor is in snappy dialog. The one-liners, subtle zingers, and satire poke fun mostly at Soviet Russia and communism. But it has occasional jabs at capitalism and western lifestyles  notably the idle rich. The movie is superb in all aspects, especially in the script, direction, settings and acting. All of the cast give top performances. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas are the perfect match for some of the funniest repartee ever put on film. But, how Garbo (Ninotchka) could keep a straight face in those exchanges, one after another, is beyond me. I'll bet MGM had to do many retakes of some of her scenes. If not for her breaking down, then for the cracking up of Douglas (Leon) or others on the set and behind the camera. "Ninotchka" is one of the great comedy-romances for the ages. Young and old alike can enjoy it. But, from some of the comments I've read, it seems much of the humor is lost without a little knowledge of the time. So, I offer these tidbits to help set the stage and prepare viewers for a most enjoyable film. The time is the late 1930s. The story takes place mostly in Paris, moves to Moscow later, and ends in Istanbul. In 1939, all the world knows about Soviet Russia and many of its problems. It has been in the news since the communist takeover after the revolutions 20 years earlier. Joseph Stalin's five-year plan for recovery since 1922 was past its 15th year. So far, it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine, the Russian people faced starvation. But that's not all. The Great Purge of 1936-38 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia, a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe, especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus, the stage is set for "Ninotchka." With the large number of reviews posted up to this time, I wouldn't normally add my own. But, I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more  and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene, Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is "peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time." She says, "Our next year's crop is in danger, and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors, there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades." What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets. Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, "I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this." And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. "Which part of the room is mine?" Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, "You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite." One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, "How are things in Moscow?" Garbo replied, "Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians." A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, "I give you my word, they were confiscated legally." In a caf&eacute; later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, "Now what shall it be?" She says, "Raw beets and carrots." He replies, "Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow." She next says, "Bring me something simple  I never think about food." The waiter asks, "If you don't think about food, what do you think about?" Ninotchka answers, "The future of the common people." And the waiter replies, "That's also a question of food." What a great running dialog! "Ninotchka" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, "Ninotchka" likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were "Gone With the Wind," "Stagecoach," Goodbye, Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "The Wizard of Oz," "Ninotchka," "Wuthering Heights," "Dark Victory," "Beau Geste," "Of Mice and Men," "Young Mr. Lincoln," "Gunga Din," "The Four Feathers," "Only Angels Have Wings," and "Bachelor Mother." Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating (on September 20, 2012) of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?

    If anyone believes that Greta Garbo could not do comedy, then watch this movie. Not only does Ms. Garbo do comedy, she makes people laugh. In fact, her performance is at times hilarious. This movie, which is a satire of the Soviet system, is brilliant. Besides being funny, the chemistry between Ms. Garbo and her co-star Melvyn Douglas is great. He and Ms. Garbo make a great comedy team. And the story itself is wonderful. Using the Soviet Union as the source of jokes is risky but the movie deals with the subject in an entertaining manner. Ms. Garbo is beautiful, witty, poignant and charming. The rest of the cast is also superb, and combined with excellent cinematography and a strong script, they combine to produce an excellent movie.

    It is a very strange film. Charming comedy, ironic picture of Soviet Union before Cold War , a political satire and a nice story, memorable characters and funny situations. But more that, final step for Garbo which creates a magnificent role. In fact, it is not an old movie but a good bye party. Fall of a Hollywood way to build a subject, lost of innocence, science to create public. And the cause is not the war . Or fashion. But a strange expectation of reality reflection. New stars and new type of film. New bones for heroic movies and new skin for comedies. End of adolescence and new speech about ordinary aspects of life. Spell is more insignificant and the budget of a movie is the real star.Greta Garbo is the seal of this lost kingdom. That film is one of important epitaphs.

    Garbo performance is immaculate in her biggest comedy role, Melvyn Douglas supporting role is also very good, he enhance Garbo perfectly. Ernst Lubitsch as director accompanied by his friend Billy Wilder as screenwriter gave us entertainment and satire in her best elegant form. The story of four Soviet spies and their antics in the France capital is the ultimate depiction of the atmosphere in Europe in the shadow of the upcoming war. We can feel the ambiguous attitude of the American people (and furthermore Lubitsch and Wilder as European immigrants) toward the Soviets in the unfolding events of Nazi aggressiveness in Europe. Paris's seductive as it can be, Garbo shine above all and the movie is fun to watch even from seven decades forward. To my opinion, someone who want to introduce himself with this 'Golden Age' of Hollywood cinema can easily be exposed by this film.

After playing tragic heroines for MGM dating back to the silent era of 1926, it was time for Garbo to either retire following her last screen appearance of CONQUEST (1937), or do something completely different. A Garbo musical might have been interesting, but quite unlikely. A western? Not quite. Garbo in pistols and petticoats would definitely not be her style, though it did work for Marlene Dietrich in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN. A murder mystery? Perhaps. Or at least another love story might suffice? The next best thing to reinventing the Garbo image turned out to be a comedy. Screwball comedies were highly successful and common place during the latter half of the thirties. For this comedy, however, it had to be both funny and agreeable to public taste. Funny and agreeable it was. Under stylish direction from the man known for his "Lubitsch touch," and excellent scripting by Charles Bracket, Billy Wilder and Walter Reich, the comedy in question resulted to the title character bearing the Russian name of NINOTCHKA. Opening title: "This picture takes place in Paris in those wonderful days when a siren was a brunette and not an alarm - and if a Frenchman turns out the light, it was not on account of an air raid!" The story opens with Russian comrades, Buljanoff (Felix Bressart), Iranoff (Sig Rumann) and Kopakski (Alexander Granach), in Paris, on a mission from the Soviet Government to sell jewels once belonging to the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) with the money used for farm machinery. Their assignment is soon forgotten as the trio enjoy themselves in the company of beautiful barmaids. Also at the luxurious hotel is Alexis Rakonin (Gregory Gaye), a Russian count posing as a waiter, who informs the Grand Duchess of their activities. Swana then has her lover, Count Leon D'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), to assist by both filing a court injunction to prevent the selling of the jewels as well as showing the comrades a good time in order to forget why they're in Paris in the first place. Due to the long delay, the Soviet sends Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, better known as Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), to investigate. Having met Ninotchka at a crosswalk, Leon, unaware of her identity, immediately becomes fascinated by her. During her stay in Paris, Leon does everything to entertain her, from escorting her to the top of the Eiffel Tower to endless attempts in trying to make her laugh. When Ninotchka finally transforms into a new woman, trading her beret for a modern hat, she, too, forgets her assignment by concentrating on Leon. When Ninotchka mysteriously returns to Russia, Leon tries to follow her there, but is unable to obtain a Visa. For Garbo's introduction in American comedy, NINOTCHKA comes no better than this. She earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for her performance. What makes NINOTCHKA work so well is the way Garbo delivers her comedy lines, in the same manner of her dramatic roles. Enacting it in a straightforward manner with no attempts of being funny is the secret to the hilarity. The more serious she is, the funnier she becomes. Of the many classic lines delivered here, with one being a little "in-joke" pertaining to Garbo's classic tag line of "wanting to be alone," the one that should get honorable mention is, "Do you want to see my wound." For Garbo's male co-star, Melvyn Douglas proved to be a most logical choice. His most classic scene comes as he helps his leading lady fulfill her much publicized slogan, "Garbo laughs!" She's laughed before on screen, but never so hysterically. A pity the Garbo-Douglas reunion comedy of TWO FACED WOMAN (1941) didn't earn the same reputation as NINOTCHKA. The now forgotten Ina Claire, better known more for her theatrical than screen performances, gives a good account of herself as the Duchess. It's a wonder how the sophisticated Genevieve Tobin might have done had she assumed that very same role. Horror movie fans will be surprised in finding the fourth-billed Bela Lugosi appearing as the Russian Commissar Razinin. Even more surprising how his one and only scene opposite Garbo to not only come very late into the 111 minute story, but one lasting a little less three minutes! As much as NINOTCHKA has been imitated and recycled throughout the years, only the musical remake, SILK STOCKINGS (MGM, 1957) starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse (Ninotchka) comes close in recapturing the success of the original. Distributed to video cassette in the mid 1980s and later onto DVD, viewers can capture a glimpse of the legendary Garbo laughing (and showing off her wound) in one of cable TV's many broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies.

    My only other experience of Garbo was in the 1925 silent film "The Joyless Street", a rather somber picture that featured her charisma with strong body language and facial expressiveness. Apparently the tag line 'Garbo Laughs' was meant to convey a change in character from her ensuing screen roles, but it takes a while to get there. It's only when her charmingly aggressive suitor (Melvyn Douglas) falls out of his chair that the stuffy Nina Ivanova Yakushova breaks character and reveals a human being underneath a commissar's clothing. The film is billed as a comedy, but it's not of the laugh out loud variety. The film delivers it's humor in the witty dialog between Garbo and Douglas, along with the calculated antics of the three apparatchiks Ninotchka has been sent to spy on and see that their mission is successful. I don't know if the title 'Envoy Extraordinaire" was a legitimate one, but Garbo takes it seriously, to the point of declining a railroad porter to take her bags, citing the 'social injustice' of it all. There are a handful of these ideological viewpoints woven into the script; another was Ninotchka's observation that as a capitalist, Douglas's Leon D'Algout was the product of a doomed culture. Personally, I enjoyed the film, though I had a sense that it started to drag at the ninety minute mark or so. The resolution of the romance between Ninotchka and Leon would have required the Russian comrade to defect so in that respect it seemed somewhat contrived. But not any more so than having the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) simply give away here jeweled fortune to entice her rival away from Paris.

    Ninotchka (1939) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Terrific romantic-comedy about a stern Russian named Ninotchka (Greta Garbo) who is sent to Paris to look in on three men who were unable to sell some jewelry due to some legal issues. Once there Ninotchka strikes up a relationship with Leon (Melvyn Douglas) who has his own reasons for wanting the jewels. Director Ernst Lubitsch hits all the right moves with this film and turns it into one of the best of its type. It's easy to see why so many people consider 1939 to be the greatest year for movies and this one here is another one of the jewels from that era. Although I'd stop short of calling this a masterpiece, there's still no question that it features a legend at the top of her game and a terrific supporting cast around her. It's funny to see the original advertisements talk about Garbo laughing since this was a very rare thing. Just like her first talking picture, which MGM played up, the moment here when she finally laughs is just a classic scene and one of the most memorable. There are so many classic moments in this film but the majority of the credit has to go to Garbo who is simply wonderful. The stern way she plays this character is just so funny and her line deliveries are flawless. When it comes time for the character to break and have some fun the actress pulls this off remarkably well. It also helps that Douglas is so great in the film and perfectly plays off the actress. Ina Claire, Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, Alexander Granach and Bela Lugosi are also very good in their supporting parts. NINOTCHKA is full of wonderfully funny moments from start to finish and it's easy to see why it's considered such a classic of its genre.

    A stern Russian woman sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man who represents everything she is supposed to detest. In her second last movie, Greta Garbo plays the title character, and in doing so, she exceeds thoroughly. Ninotchka is a hilarious and laugh-filled romantic comedy, and one of Garbo's best. I saw this movie a very long time ago, and I watched it again recently because I didn't remember it that much, and when I watched it again, I certainly had a fun time, as I was laughing quite a lot. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas were superb in their roles, and not only that, but there was also a good amount of chemistry between the two, they were perfect, I don't know if I can think of anybody who could have done a better job than they did. This movie is a comedy masterpiece, it's one of the best comedies of all time, and one of the best movies of the 1930's! There are big laughs in this movie, as well as many passions, and of course, there is what you'd expect to see in a great movie like this, great writing, great directing, and especially, great acting! Sadly, after making one more movie, Greta Garbo would retire from acting. Melvyn Douglas however, would go on to further greatness. In 1963, he would win is first Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Hud, and then in 1979, he would win his second Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Being There. In addition to Garbo and Douglas, the supporting cast is also noteworthy, the two biggest examples are Bela Lugosi (who as you know, is famous for playing Dracula, and being in a lot of Ed Wood's movies later in his career) and Sig Ruman (who appeared in White Christmas, Stalag 17, and numerous movies with the Marx Brothers). But as you might have already known, the best ones in the movie are of course, Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, especially the former. It's a pity that Garbo retired soon after this, as she was one of the few actresses who was successful after the era of silent movies. Ninotchka is the perfect romantic comedy to spend one hour and fifty minutes watching, as it's got exactly what you would expect to see in a great romantic comedy, laughs, passions, great directing, great acting, and great writing. There are a lot of funny scenes, such as the restaurant scene and the ending (which I am not going to say what it is because it would spoil things), not to mention the part where they climb up the Eiffel Tower. So if you are looking for a great romantic comedy to watch and laugh at, then join Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas for 1939's Ninotchka, which is yet another great movie released in what many people consider to be the greatest year for movies. And by the way, the script of this movie was co-written by Billy Wilder, who would later write and direct classics like The Lost Weekend, The Apartment, Stalag 17, and The Fortune Cookie. In short, Ninotchka is a great comedy, one somebody watches it, it will be impossible for them not to laugh at least once. 10/10

    "Ninotchka" is one of the funniest movies ever made. But it's not a slapstick or screwball comedy. It is in the class of "It Happened One Night," "My Man Godfry," and "Holiday." The humor is in snappy dialog. The one-liners, subtle zingers, and satire poke fun mostly at Soviet Russia and communism. But it has occasional jabs at capitalism and western lifestyles  notably the idle rich. The movie is superb in all aspects, especially in the script, direction, settings and acting. All of the cast give top performances. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas are the perfect match for some of the funniest repartee ever put on film. But, how Garbo (Ninotchka) could keep a straight face in those exchanges, one after another, is beyond me. I'll bet MGM had to do many retakes of some of her scenes. If not for her breaking down, then for the cracking up of Douglas (Leon) or others on the set and behind the camera. "Ninotchka" is one of the great comedy-romances for the ages. Young and old alike can enjoy it. But, from some of the comments I've read, it seems much of the humor is lost without a little knowledge of the time. So, I offer these tidbits to help set the stage and prepare viewers for a most enjoyable film. The time is the late 1930s. The story takes place mostly in Paris, moves to Moscow later, and ends in Istanbul. In 1939, all the world knows about Soviet Russia and many of its problems. It has been in the news since the communist takeover after the revolutions 20 years earlier. Joseph Stalin's five-year plan for recovery since 1922 was past its 15th year. So far, it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine, the Russian people faced starvation. But that's not all. The Great Purge of 1936-38 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia, a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe, especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus, the stage is set for "Ninotchka." With the large number of reviews posted up to this time, I wouldn't normally add my own. But, I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more  and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene, Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is "peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time." She says, "Our next year's crop is in danger, and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors, there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades." What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets. Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, "I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this." And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. "Which part of the room is mine?" Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, "You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite." One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, "How are things in Moscow?" Garbo replied, "Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians." A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, "I give you my word, they were confiscated legally." In a caf&eacute; later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, "Now what shall it be?" She says, "Raw beets and carrots." He replies, "Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow." She next says, "Bring me something simple  I never think about food." The waiter asks, "If you don't think about food, what do you think about?" Ninotchka answers, "The future of the common people." And the waiter replies, "That's also a question of food." What a great running dialog! "Ninotchka" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, "Ninotchka" likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were "Gone With the Wind," "Stagecoach," Goodbye, Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "The Wizard of Oz," "Ninotchka," "Wuthering Heights," "Dark Victory," "Beau Geste," "Of Mice and Men," "Young Mr. Lincoln," "Gunga Din," "The Four Feathers," "Only Angels Have Wings," and "Bachelor Mother." Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating (on September 20, 2012) of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?

    If anyone believes that Greta Garbo could not do comedy, then watch this movie. Not only does Ms. Garbo do comedy, she makes people laugh. In fact, her performance is at times hilarious. This movie, which is a satire of the Soviet system, is brilliant. Besides being funny, the chemistry between Ms. Garbo and her co-star Melvyn Douglas is great. He and Ms. Garbo make a great comedy team. And the story itself is wonderful. Using the Soviet Union as the source of jokes is risky but the movie deals with the subject in an entertaining manner. Ms. Garbo is beautiful, witty, poignant and charming. The rest of the cast is also superb, and combined with excellent cinematography and a strong script, they combine to produce an excellent movie.

    It is a very strange film. Charming comedy, ironic picture of Soviet Union before Cold War , a political satire and a nice story, memorable characters and funny situations. But more that, final step for Garbo which creates a magnificent role. In fact, it is not an old movie but a good bye party. Fall of a Hollywood way to build a subject, lost of innocence, science to create public. And the cause is not the war . Or fashion. But a strange expectation of reality reflection. New stars and new type of film. New bones for heroic movies and new skin for comedies. End of adolescence and new speech about ordinary aspects of life. Spell is more insignificant and the budget of a movie is the real star.Greta Garbo is the seal of this lost kingdom. That film is one of important epitaphs.

    Garbo performance is immaculate in her biggest comedy role, Melvyn Douglas supporting role is also very good, he enhance Garbo perfectly. Ernst Lubitsch as director accompanied by his friend Billy Wilder as screenwriter gave us entertainment and satire in her best elegant form. The story of four Soviet spies and their antics in the France capital is the ultimate depiction of the atmosphere in Europe in the shadow of the upcoming war. We can feel the ambiguous attitude of the American people (and furthermore Lubitsch and Wilder as European immigrants) toward the Soviets in the unfolding events of Nazi aggressiveness in Europe. Paris's seductive as it can be, Garbo shine above all and the movie is fun to watch even from seven decades forward. To my opinion, someone who want to introduce himself with this 'Golden Age' of Hollywood cinema can easily be exposed by this film.

    A stern Russian woman (Greta Garbo) sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man (Melvyn Douglas) who represents everything she is supposed to detest. The way Soviet Russia is portrayed here is quite strange. We have Ninotchka saying an old man looks "sad" and should not be working, she has a strict adherence to custom and regulation. And censorship completely blocks out the letters of friends. While I do not think this is completely off-base, surely this is exaggerated. (Of course, in some ways, the situation was probably far worse.) I love that this has a Billy Wilder script. Wilder learned a lot from director Lubitsch and went on to direct some of the greatest films out there (I would argue that Wilder surpassed Lubitsch in greatness). We also get a great appearance (although all too small) of the legendary Bela Lugosi.

    From director Ernst Lubitsch (To Be or Not to Be, Heaven Can Wait), I had heard the leading actress name a few times, I didn't know much about her, especially not that she retired at the age of thirty five after only twenty eight films, and I was looking forward to this title I recognised from her career. Basically in Paris, France, three Russians, Iranov (Sig Ruman), Buljanov (Felix Bressart) and Kopalsky (Alexander Granach), are selling jewellery from the aristocracy that they confiscated during the 1917 Russian Revolution, and arriving they meet Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) who is trying to retrieve her jewellery back for Russian Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire). But he corrupts the three men and convinces them to stay in Paris since they have become accustomed to their French surroundings, so special diplomatic agent Nina Ivanovna "Ninotchka" Yakushova (Oscar nominated Greta Garbo) has been sent by the Soviet Union to make sure the sale goes ahead and bring the three men back to Russia. She is stern and non nonsense with her attitude, and for a while she has no time to mess around with pleasure rather than business, but after meeting Leon and being introduced more to the culture of the West she lightens up. Ninotchka and Leon slowly fall in love with each other, and this allows the three Russians to do a kindness for capitalism, and in the end the Russian agent leaves behind her work to have a relationship with the Count, and one of the three men protects that the other two were unfair to him, this is a joke. Also starring Bela Lugosi as Commissar Razinin and Gregory Gaye as Count Alexis Rakonin. Garbo gives a great performance as the first strict and then light-hearted Russian agent, and Douglas is likable as the charming man and love interest, I will confess that I could not understand the political stuff and I could not follow everything going on, but I did laugh when the jokes were simple and well made, the most funny material is during the caf&eacute; scene, and the love story is nice, so it was an fun sophisticated comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Writing, Original Story and Best Writing, Screenplay. Greta Garbo was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 44 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 52 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    NINOTCHKA (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, ranks one of the finest comedies to emerge in what's regarded to be Hollywood's greatest year, 1939. It was also that very year where certain top-rated stars, having gone through a declining period, would recapture the status they once acquired some time ago. The legendary Greta Garbo happened to be one of them. After playing tragic heroines for MGM dating back to the silent era of 1926, it was time for Garbo to either retire following her last screen appearance of CONQUEST (1937), or do something completely different. A Garbo musical might have been interesting, but quite unlikely. A western? Not quite.

Funny and agreeable it was. Under stylish direction from the man known for his "Lubitsch touch," and excellent scripting by Charles Bracket, Billy Wilder and Walter Reich, the comedy in question resulted to the title character bearing the Russian name of NINOTCHKA. Opening title: "This picture takes place in Paris in those wonderful days when a siren was a brunette and not an alarm - and if a Frenchman turns out the light, it was not on account of an air raid!" The story opens with Russian comrades, Buljanoff (Felix Bressart), Iranoff (Sig Rumann) and Kopakski (Alexander Granach), in Paris, on a mission from the Soviet Government to sell jewels once belonging to the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) with the money used for farm machinery. Their assignment is soon forgotten as the trio enjoy themselves in the company of beautiful barmaids. Also at the luxurious hotel is Alexis Rakonin (Gregory Gaye), a Russian count posing as a waiter, who informs the Grand Duchess of their activities. Swana then has her lover, Count Leon D'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), to assist by both filing a court injunction to prevent the selling of the jewels as well as showing the comrades a good time in order to forget why they're in Paris in the first place. Due to the long delay, the Soviet sends Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, better known as Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), to investigate. Having met Ninotchka at a crosswalk, Leon, unaware of her identity, immediately becomes fascinated by her. During her stay in Paris, Leon does everything to entertain her, from escorting her to the top of the Eiffel Tower to endless attempts in trying to make her laugh. When Ninotchka finally transforms into a new woman, trading her beret for a modern hat, she, too, forgets her assignment by concentrating on Leon. When Ninotchka mysteriously returns to Russia, Leon tries to follow her there, but is unable to obtain a Visa. For Garbo's introduction in American comedy, NINOTCHKA comes no better than this.

Director Ernst Lubitsch hits all the right moves with this film and turns it into one of the best of its type. It's easy to see why so many people consider 1939 to be the greatest year for movies and this one here is another one of the jewels from that era. Although I'd stop short of calling this a masterpiece, there's still no question that it features a legend at the top of her game and a terrific supporting cast around her. It's funny to see the original advertisements talk about Garbo laughing since this was a very rare thing. Just like her first talking picture, which MGM played up, the moment here when she finally laughs is just a classic scene and one of the most memorable. There are so many classic moments in this film but the majority of the credit has to go to Garbo who is simply wonderful. The stern way she plays this character is just so funny and her line deliveries are flawless. When it comes time for the character to break and have some fun the actress pulls this off remarkably well. It also helps that Douglas is so great in the film and perfectly plays off the actress. Ina Claire, Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, Alexander Granach and Bela Lugosi are also very good in their supporting parts. NINOTCHKA is full of wonderfully funny moments from start to finish and it's easy to see why it's considered such a classic of its genre.

    A stern Russian woman sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man who represents everything she is supposed to detest. In her second last movie, Greta Garbo plays the title character, and in doing so, she exceeds thoroughly. Ninotchka is a hilarious and laugh-filled romantic comedy, and one of Garbo's best. I saw this movie a very long time ago, and I watched it again recently because I didn't remember it that much, and when I watched it again, I certainly had a fun time, as I was laughing quite a lot. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas were superb in their roles, and not only that, but there was also a good amount of chemistry between the two, they were perfect, I don't know if I can think of anybody who could have done a better job than they did. This movie is a comedy masterpiece, it's one of the best comedies of all time, and one of the best movies of the 1930's! There are big laughs in this movie, as well as many passions, and of course, there is what you'd expect to see in a great movie like this, great writing, great directing, and especially, great acting! Sadly, after making one more movie, Greta Garbo would retire from acting. Melvyn Douglas however, would go on to further greatness. In 1963, he would win is first Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Hud, and then in 1979, he would win his second Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Being There. In addition to Garbo and Douglas, the supporting cast is also noteworthy, the two biggest examples are Bela Lugosi (who as you know, is famous for playing Dracula, and being in a lot of Ed Wood's movies later in his career) and Sig Ruman (who appeared in White Christmas, Stalag 17, and numerous movies with the Marx Brothers). But as you might have already known, the best ones in the movie are of course, Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, especially the former. It's a pity that Garbo retired soon after this, as she was one of the few actresses who was successful after the era of silent movies. Ninotchka is the perfect romantic comedy to spend one hour and fifty minutes watching, as it's got exactly what you would expect to see in a great romantic comedy, laughs, passions, great directing, great acting, and great writing. There are a lot of funny scenes, such as the restaurant scene and the ending (which I am not going to say what it is because it would spoil things), not to mention the part where they climb up the Eiffel Tower. So if you are looking for a great romantic comedy to watch and laugh at, then join Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas for 1939's Ninotchka, which is yet another great movie released in what many people consider to be the greatest year for movies. And by the way, the script of this movie was co-written by Billy Wilder, who would later write and direct classics like The Lost Weekend, The Apartment, Stalag 17, and The Fortune Cookie. In short, Ninotchka is a great comedy, one somebody watches it, it will be impossible for them not to laugh at least once. 10/10

    "Ninotchka" is one of the funniest movies ever made. But it's not a slapstick or screwball comedy. It is in the class of "It Happened One Night," "My Man Godfry," and "Holiday." The humor is in snappy dialog. The one-liners, subtle zingers, and satire poke fun mostly at Soviet Russia and communism. But it has occasional jabs at capitalism and western lifestyles  notably the idle rich. The movie is superb in all aspects, especially in the script, direction, settings and acting. All of the cast give top performances. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas are the perfect match for some of the funniest repartee ever put on film. But, how Garbo (Ninotchka) could keep a straight face in those exchanges, one after another, is beyond me. I'll bet MGM had to do many retakes of some of her scenes. If not for her breaking down, then for the cracking up of Douglas (Leon) or others on the set and behind the camera. "Ninotchka" is one of the great comedy-romances for the ages. Young and old alike can enjoy it. But, from some of the comments I've read, it seems much of the humor is lost without a little knowledge of the time. So, I offer these tidbits to help set the stage and prepare viewers for a most enjoyable film. The time is the late 1930s. The story takes place mostly in Paris, moves to Moscow later, and ends in Istanbul. In 1939, all the world knows about Soviet Russia and many of its problems. It has been in the news since the communist takeover after the revolutions 20 years earlier. Joseph Stalin's five-year plan for recovery since 1922 was past its 15th year. So far, it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine, the Russian people faced starvation. But that's not all. The Great Purge of 1936-38 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia, a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe, especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus, the stage is set for "Ninotchka." With the large number of reviews posted up to this time, I wouldn't normally add my own. But, I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more  and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene, Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is "peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time." She says, "Our next year's crop is in danger, and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors, there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades." What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets. Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, "I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this." And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. "Which part of the room is mine?" Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, "You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite." One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, "How are things in Moscow?" Garbo replied, "Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians." A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, "I give you my word, they were confiscated legally." In a caf&eacute; later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, "Now what shall it be?" She says, "Raw beets and carrots." He replies, "Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow." She next says, "Bring me something simple  I never think about food." The waiter asks, "If you don't think about food, what do you think about?" Ninotchka answers, "The future of the common people." And the waiter replies, "That's also a question of food." What a great running dialog! "Ninotchka" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, "Ninotchka" likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were "Gone With the Wind," "Stagecoach," Goodbye, Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "The Wizard of Oz," "Ninotchka," "Wuthering Heights," "Dark Victory," "Beau Geste," "Of Mice and Men," "Young Mr. Lincoln," "Gunga Din," "The Four Feathers," "Only Angels Have Wings," and "Bachelor Mother." Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating (on September 20, 2012) of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?

    If anyone believes that Greta Garbo could not do comedy, then watch this movie. Not only does Ms. Garbo do comedy, she makes people laugh. In fact, her performance is at times hilarious. This movie, which is a satire of the Soviet system, is brilliant. Besides being funny, the chemistry between Ms. Garbo and her co-star Melvyn Douglas is great. He and Ms. Garbo make a great comedy team. And the story itself is wonderful. Using the Soviet Union as the source of jokes is risky but the movie deals with the subject in an entertaining manner. Ms. Garbo is beautiful, witty, poignant and charming. The rest of the cast is also superb, and combined with excellent cinematography and a strong script, they combine to produce an excellent movie.

    It is a very strange film. Charming comedy, ironic picture of Soviet Union before Cold War , a political satire and a nice story, memorable characters and funny situations. But more that, final step for Garbo which creates a magnificent role. In fact, it is not an old movie but a good bye party. Fall of a Hollywood way to build a subject, lost of innocence, science to create public. And the cause is not the war . Or fashion. But a strange expectation of reality reflection. New stars and new type of film. New bones for heroic movies and new skin for comedies. End of adolescence and new speech about ordinary aspects of life. Spell is more insignificant and the budget of a movie is the real star.Greta Garbo is the seal of this lost kingdom. That film is one of important epitaphs.

    Garbo performance is immaculate in her biggest comedy role, Melvyn Douglas supporting role is also very good, he enhance Garbo perfectly. Ernst Lubitsch as director accompanied by his friend Billy Wilder as screenwriter gave us entertainment and satire in her best elegant form. The story of four Soviet spies and their antics in the France capital is the ultimate depiction of the atmosphere in Europe in the shadow of the upcoming war. We can feel the ambiguous attitude of the American people (and furthermore Lubitsch and Wilder as European immigrants) toward the Soviets in the unfolding events of Nazi aggressiveness in Europe. Paris's seductive as it can be, Garbo shine above all and the movie is fun to watch even from seven decades forward. To my opinion, someone who want to introduce himself with this 'Golden Age' of Hollywood cinema can easily be exposed by this film.

    A stern Russian woman (Greta Garbo) sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man (Melvyn Douglas) who represents everything she is supposed to detest. The way Soviet Russia is portrayed here is quite strange. We have Ninotchka saying an old man looks "sad" and should not be working, she has a strict adherence to custom and regulation. And censorship completely blocks out the letters of friends. While I do not think this is completely off-base, surely this is exaggerated. (Of course, in some ways, the situation was probably far worse.) I love that this has a Billy Wilder script. Wilder learned a lot from director Lubitsch and went on to direct some of the greatest films out there (I would argue that Wilder surpassed Lubitsch in greatness). We also get a great appearance (although all too small) of the legendary Bela Lugosi.

    From director Ernst Lubitsch (To Be or Not to Be, Heaven Can Wait), I had heard the leading actress name a few times, I didn't know much about her, especially not that she retired at the age of thirty five after only twenty eight films, and I was looking forward to this title I recognised from her career. Basically in Paris, France, three Russians, Iranov (Sig Ruman), Buljanov (Felix Bressart) and Kopalsky (Alexander Granach), are selling jewellery from the aristocracy that they confiscated during the 1917 Russian Revolution, and arriving they meet Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) who is trying to retrieve her jewellery back for Russian Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire). But he corrupts the three men and convinces them to stay in Paris since they have become accustomed to their French surroundings, so special diplomatic agent Nina Ivanovna "Ninotchka" Yakushova (Oscar nominated Greta Garbo) has been sent by the Soviet Union to make sure the sale goes ahead and bring the three men back to Russia. She is stern and non nonsense with her attitude, and for a while she has no time to mess around with pleasure rather than business, but after meeting Leon and being introduced more to the culture of the West she lightens up. Ninotchka and Leon slowly fall in love with each other, and this allows the three Russians to do a kindness for capitalism, and in the end the Russian agent leaves behind her work to have a relationship with the Count, and one of the three men protects that the other two were unfair to him, this is a joke. Also starring Bela Lugosi as Commissar Razinin and Gregory Gaye as Count Alexis Rakonin. Garbo gives a great performance as the first strict and then light-hearted Russian agent, and Douglas is likable as the charming man and love interest, I will confess that I could not understand the political stuff and I could not follow everything going on, but I did laugh when the jokes were simple and well made, the most funny material is during the caf&eacute; scene, and the love story is nice, so it was an fun sophisticated comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Writing, Original Story and Best Writing, Screenplay. Greta Garbo was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 44 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 52 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    NINOTCHKA (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, ranks one of the finest comedies to emerge in what's regarded to be Hollywood's greatest year, 1939. It was also that very year where certain top-rated stars, having gone through a declining period, would recapture the status they once acquired some time ago. The legendary Greta Garbo happened to be one of them. After playing tragic heroines for MGM dating back to the silent era of 1926, it was time for Garbo to either retire following her last screen appearance of CONQUEST (1937), or do something completely different. A Garbo musical might have been interesting, but quite unlikely. A western? Not quite. Garbo in pistols and petticoats would definitely not be her style, though it did work for Marlene Dietrich in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN. A murder mystery? Perhaps. Or at least another love story might suffice? The next best thing to reinventing the Garbo image turned out to be a comedy. Screwball comedies were highly successful and common place during the latter half of the thirties. For this comedy, however, it had to be both funny and agreeable to public taste. Funny and agreeable it was. Under stylish direction from the man known for his "Lubitsch touch," and excellent scripting by Charles Bracket, Billy Wilder and Walter Reich, the comedy in question resulted to the title character bearing the Russian name of NINOTCHKA. Opening title: "This picture takes place in Paris in those wonderful days when a siren was a brunette and not an alarm - and if a Frenchman turns out the light, it was not on account of an air raid!" The story opens with Russian comrades, Buljanoff (Felix Bressart), Iranoff (Sig Rumann) and Kopakski (Alexander Granach), in Paris, on a mission from the Soviet Government to sell jewels once belonging to the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) with the money used for farm machinery. Their assignment is soon forgotten as the trio enjoy themselves in the company of beautiful barmaids. Also at the luxurious hotel is Alexis Rakonin (Gregory Gaye), a Russian count posing as a waiter, who informs the Grand Duchess of their activities. Swana then has her lover, Count Leon D'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), to assist by both filing a court injunction to prevent the selling of the jewels as well as showing the comrades a good time in order to forget why they're in Paris in the first place. Due to the long delay, the Soviet sends Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, better known as Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), to investigate. Having met Ninotchka at a crosswalk, Leon, unaware of her identity, immediately becomes fascinated by her. During her stay in Paris, Leon does everything to entertain her, from escorting her to the top of the Eiffel Tower to endless attempts in trying to make her laugh. When Ninotchka finally transforms into a new woman, trading her beret for a modern hat, she, too, forgets her assignment by concentrating on Leon. When Ninotchka mysteriously returns to Russia, Leon tries to follow her there, but is unable to obtain a Visa. For Garbo's introduction in American comedy, NINOTCHKA comes no better than this. She earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for her performance. What makes NINOTCHKA work so well is the way Garbo delivers her comedy lines, in the same manner of her dramatic roles. Enacting it in a straightforward manner with no attempts of being funny is the secret to the hilarity. The more serious she is, the funnier she becomes. Of the many classic lines delivered here, with one being a little "in-joke" pertaining to Garbo's classic tag line of "wanting to be alone," the one that should get honorable mention is, "Do you want to see my wound." For Garbo's male co-star, Melvyn Douglas proved to be a most logical choice. His most classic scene comes as he helps his leading lady fulfill her much publicized slogan, "Garbo laughs!" She's laughed before on screen, but never so hysterically. A pity the Garbo-Douglas reunion comedy of TWO FACED WOMAN (1941) didn't earn the same reputation as NINOTCHKA. The now forgotten Ina Claire, better known more for her theatrical than screen performances, gives a good account of herself as the Duchess. It's a wonder how the sophisticated Genevieve Tobin might have done had she assumed that very same role. Horror movie fans will be surprised in finding the fourth-billed Bela Lugosi appearing as the Russian Commissar Razinin. Even more surprising how his one and only scene opposite Garbo to not only come very late into the 111 minute story, but one lasting a little less three minutes! As much as NINOTCHKA has been imitated and recycled throughout the years, only the musical remake, SILK STOCKINGS (MGM, 1957) starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse (Ninotchka) comes close in recapturing the success of the original. Distributed to video cassette in the mid 1980s and later onto DVD, viewers can capture a glimpse of the legendary Garbo laughing (and showing off her wound) in one of cable TV's many broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies.

    My only other experience of Garbo was in the 1925 silent film "The Joyless Street", a rather somber picture that featured her charisma with strong body language and facial expressiveness. Apparently the tag line 'Garbo Laughs' was meant to convey a change in character from her ensuing screen roles, but it takes a while to get there. It's only when her charmingly aggressive suitor (Melvyn Douglas) falls out of his chair that the stuffy Nina Ivanova Yakushova breaks character and reveals a human being underneath a commissar's clothing. The film is billed as a comedy, but it's not of the laugh out loud variety. The film delivers it's humor in the witty dialog between Garbo and Douglas, along with the calculated antics of the three apparatchiks Ninotchka has been sent to spy on and see that their mission is successful. I don't know if the title 'Envoy Extraordinaire" was a legitimate one, but Garbo takes it seriously, to the point of declining a railroad porter to take her bags, citing the 'social injustice' of it all. There are a handful of these ideological viewpoints woven into the script; another was Ninotchka's observation that as a capitalist, Douglas's Leon D'Algout was the product of a doomed culture. Personally, I enjoyed the film, though I had a sense that it started to drag at the ninety minute mark or so. The resolution of the romance between Ninotchka and Leon would have required the Russian comrade to defect so in that respect it seemed somewhat contrived. But not any more so than having the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) simply give away here jeweled fortune to entice her rival away from Paris.

So far, it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine, the Russian people faced starvation. But that's not all. The Great Purge of 1936-38 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia, a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe, especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus, the stage is set for "Ninotchka." With the large number of reviews posted up to this time, I wouldn't normally add my own. But, I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more  and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene, Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is "peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time." She says, "Our next year's crop is in danger, and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors, there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades." What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets. Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, "I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this." And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. "Which part of the room is mine?" Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, "You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite." One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, "How are things in Moscow?" Garbo replied, "Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians." A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, "I give you my word, they were confiscated legally." In a caf&eacute; later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, "Now what shall it be?" She says, "Raw beets and carrots." He replies, "Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow." She next says, "Bring me something simple  I never think about food." The waiter asks, "If you don't think about food, what do you think about?" Ninotchka answers, "The future of the common people." And the waiter replies, "That's also a question of food." What a great running dialog! "Ninotchka" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, "Ninotchka" likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were "Gone With the Wind," "Stagecoach," Goodbye, Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "The Wizard of Oz," "Ninotchka," "Wuthering Heights," "Dark Victory," "Beau Geste," "Of Mice and Men," "Young Mr. Lincoln," "Gunga Din," "The Four Feathers," "Only Angels Have Wings," and "Bachelor Mother." Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating (on September 20, 2012) of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?

    If anyone believes that Greta Garbo could not do comedy, then watch this movie. Not only does Ms. Garbo do comedy, she makes people laugh. In fact, her performance is at times hilarious. This movie, which is a satire of the Soviet system, is brilliant. Besides being funny, the chemistry between Ms. Garbo and her co-star Melvyn Douglas is great. He and Ms. Garbo make a great comedy team. And the story itself is wonderful. Using the Soviet Union as the source of jokes is risky but the movie deals with the subject in an entertaining manner. Ms. Garbo is beautiful, witty, poignant and charming. The rest of the cast is also superb, and combined with excellent cinematography and a strong script, they combine to produce an excellent movie.

    It is a very strange film. Charming comedy, ironic picture of Soviet Union before Cold War , a political satire and a nice story, memorable characters and funny situations. But more that, final step for Garbo which creates a magnificent role. In fact, it is not an old movie but a good bye party. Fall of a Hollywood way to build a subject, lost of innocence, science to create public. And the cause is not the war . Or fashion. But a strange expectation of reality reflection. New stars and new type of film. New bones for heroic movies and new skin for comedies. End of adolescence and new speech about ordinary aspects of life. Spell is more insignificant and the budget of a movie is the real star.Greta Garbo is the seal of this lost kingdom. That film is one of important epitaphs.

    Garbo performance is immaculate in her biggest comedy role, Melvyn Douglas supporting role is also very good, he enhance Garbo perfectly. Ernst Lubitsch as director accompanied by his friend Billy Wilder as screenwriter gave us entertainment and satire in her best elegant form. The story of four Soviet spies and their antics in the France capital is the ultimate depiction of the atmosphere in Europe in the shadow of the upcoming war. We can feel the ambiguous attitude of the American people (and furthermore Lubitsch and Wilder as European immigrants) toward the Soviets in the unfolding events of Nazi aggressiveness in Europe. Paris's seductive as it can be, Garbo shine above all and the movie is fun to watch even from seven decades forward. To my opinion, someone who want to introduce himself with this 'Golden Age' of Hollywood cinema can easily be exposed by this film.

    A stern Russian woman (Greta Garbo) sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man (Melvyn Douglas) who represents everything she is supposed to detest. The way Soviet Russia is portrayed here is quite strange. We have Ninotchka saying an old man looks "sad" and should not be working, she has a strict adherence to custom and regulation. And censorship completely blocks out the letters of friends. While I do not think this is completely off-base, surely this is exaggerated. (Of course, in some ways, the situation was probably far worse.) I love that this has a Billy Wilder script. Wilder learned a lot from director Lubitsch and went on to direct some of the greatest films out there (I would argue that Wilder surpassed Lubitsch in greatness). We also get a great appearance (although all too small) of the legendary Bela Lugosi.

    From director Ernst Lubitsch (To Be or Not to Be, Heaven Can Wait), I had heard the leading actress name a few times, I didn't know much about her, especially not that she retired at the age of thirty five after only twenty eight films, and I was looking forward to this title I recognised from her career. Basically in Paris, France, three Russians, Iranov (Sig Ruman), Buljanov (Felix Bressart) and Kopalsky (Alexander Granach), are selling jewellery from the aristocracy that they confiscated during the 1917 Russian Revolution, and arriving they meet Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) who is trying to retrieve her jewellery back for Russian Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire). But he corrupts the three men and convinces them to stay in Paris since they have become accustomed to their French surroundings, so special diplomatic agent Nina Ivanovna "Ninotchka" Yakushova (Oscar nominated Greta Garbo) has been sent by the Soviet Union to make sure the sale goes ahead and bring the three men back to Russia. She is stern and non nonsense with her attitude, and for a while she has no time to mess around with pleasure rather than business, but after meeting Leon and being introduced more to the culture of the West she lightens up. Ninotchka and Leon slowly fall in love with each other, and this allows the three Russians to do a kindness for capitalism, and in the end the Russian agent leaves behind her work to have a relationship with the Count, and one of the three men protects that the other two were unfair to him, this is a joke. Also starring Bela Lugosi as Commissar Razinin and Gregory Gaye as Count Alexis Rakonin. Garbo gives a great performance as the first strict and then light-hearted Russian agent, and Douglas is likable as the charming man and love interest, I will confess that I could not understand the political stuff and I could not follow everything going on, but I did laugh when the jokes were simple and well made, the most funny material is during the caf&eacute; scene, and the love story is nice, so it was an fun sophisticated comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Writing, Original Story and Best Writing, Screenplay. Greta Garbo was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 44 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 52 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    NINOTCHKA (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, ranks one of the finest comedies to emerge in what's regarded to be Hollywood's greatest year, 1939. It was also that very year where certain top-rated stars, having gone through a declining period, would recapture the status they once acquired some time ago. The legendary Greta Garbo happened to be one of them. After playing tragic heroines for MGM dating back to the silent era of 1926, it was time for Garbo to either retire following her last screen appearance of CONQUEST (1937), or do something completely different. A Garbo musical might have been interesting, but quite unlikely. A western? Not quite. Garbo in pistols and petticoats would definitely not be her style, though it did work for Marlene Dietrich in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN. A murder mystery? Perhaps. Or at least another love story might suffice? The next best thing to reinventing the Garbo image turned out to be a comedy. Screwball comedies were highly successful and common place during the latter half of the thirties. For this comedy, however, it had to be both funny and agreeable to public taste. Funny and agreeable it was. Under stylish direction from the man known for his "Lubitsch touch," and excellent scripting by Charles Bracket, Billy Wilder and Walter Reich, the comedy in question resulted to the title character bearing the Russian name of NINOTCHKA. Opening title: "This picture takes place in Paris in those wonderful days when a siren was a brunette and not an alarm - and if a Frenchman turns out the light, it was not on account of an air raid!" The story opens with Russian comrades, Buljanoff (Felix Bressart), Iranoff (Sig Rumann) and Kopakski (Alexander Granach), in Paris, on a mission from the Soviet Government to sell jewels once belonging to the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) with the money used for farm machinery. Their assignment is soon forgotten as the trio enjoy themselves in the company of beautiful barmaids. Also at the luxurious hotel is Alexis Rakonin (Gregory Gaye), a Russian count posing as a waiter, who informs the Grand Duchess of their activities. Swana then has her lover, Count Leon D'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), to assist by both filing a court injunction to prevent the selling of the jewels as well as showing the comrades a good time in order to forget why they're in Paris in the first place. Due to the long delay, the Soviet sends Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, better known as Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), to investigate. Having met Ninotchka at a crosswalk, Leon, unaware of her identity, immediately becomes fascinated by her. During her stay in Paris, Leon does everything to entertain her, from escorting her to the top of the Eiffel Tower to endless attempts in trying to make her laugh. When Ninotchka finally transforms into a new woman, trading her beret for a modern hat, she, too, forgets her assignment by concentrating on Leon. When Ninotchka mysteriously returns to Russia, Leon tries to follow her there, but is unable to obtain a Visa. For Garbo's introduction in American comedy, NINOTCHKA comes no better than this. She earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for her performance. What makes NINOTCHKA work so well is the way Garbo delivers her comedy lines, in the same manner of her dramatic roles. Enacting it in a straightforward manner with no attempts of being funny is the secret to the hilarity. The more serious she is, the funnier she becomes. Of the many classic lines delivered here, with one being a little "in-joke" pertaining to Garbo's classic tag line of "wanting to be alone," the one that should get honorable mention is, "Do you want to see my wound." For Garbo's male co-star, Melvyn Douglas proved to be a most logical choice. His most classic scene comes as he helps his leading lady fulfill her much publicized slogan, "Garbo laughs!" She's laughed before on screen, but never so hysterically. A pity the Garbo-Douglas reunion comedy of TWO FACED WOMAN (1941) didn't earn the same reputation as NINOTCHKA. The now forgotten Ina Claire, better known more for her theatrical than screen performances, gives a good account of herself as the Duchess. It's a wonder how the sophisticated Genevieve Tobin might have done had she assumed that very same role. Horror movie fans will be surprised in finding the fourth-billed Bela Lugosi appearing as the Russian Commissar Razinin. Even more surprising how his one and only scene opposite Garbo to not only come very late into the 111 minute story, but one lasting a little less three minutes! As much as NINOTCHKA has been imitated and recycled throughout the years, only the musical remake, SILK STOCKINGS (MGM, 1957) starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse (Ninotchka) comes close in recapturing the success of the original. Distributed to video cassette in the mid 1980s and later onto DVD, viewers can capture a glimpse of the legendary Garbo laughing (and showing off her wound) in one of cable TV's many broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies.

    My only other experience of Garbo was in the 1925 silent film "The Joyless Street", a rather somber picture that featured her charisma with strong body language and facial expressiveness. Apparently the tag line 'Garbo Laughs' was meant to convey a change in character from her ensuing screen roles, but it takes a while to get there. It's only when her charmingly aggressive suitor (Melvyn Douglas) falls out of his chair that the stuffy Nina Ivanova Yakushova breaks character and reveals a human being underneath a commissar's clothing. The film is billed as a comedy, but it's not of the laugh out loud variety. The film delivers it's humor in the witty dialog between Garbo and Douglas, along with the calculated antics of the three apparatchiks Ninotchka has been sent to spy on and see that their mission is successful. I don't know if the title 'Envoy Extraordinaire" was a legitimate one, but Garbo takes it seriously, to the point of declining a railroad porter to take her bags, citing the 'social injustice' of it all. There are a handful of these ideological viewpoints woven into the script; another was Ninotchka's observation that as a capitalist, Douglas's Leon D'Algout was the product of a doomed culture. Personally, I enjoyed the film, though I had a sense that it started to drag at the ninety minute mark or so. The resolution of the romance between Ninotchka and Leon would have required the Russian comrade to defect so in that respect it seemed somewhat contrived. But not any more so than having the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) simply give away here jeweled fortune to entice her rival away from Paris.

    Ninotchka (1939) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Terrific romantic-comedy about a stern Russian named Ninotchka (Greta Garbo) who is sent to Paris to look in on three men who were unable to sell some jewelry due to some legal issues. Once there Ninotchka strikes up a relationship with Leon (Melvyn Douglas) who has his own reasons for wanting the jewels. Director Ernst Lubitsch hits all the right moves with this film and turns it into one of the best of its type. It's easy to see why so many people consider 1939 to be the greatest year for movies and this one here is another one of the jewels from that era. Although I'd stop short of calling this a masterpiece, there's still no question that it features a legend at the top of her game and a terrific supporting cast around her. It's funny to see the original advertisements talk about Garbo laughing since this was a very rare thing. Just like her first talking picture, which MGM played up, the moment here when she finally laughs is just a classic scene and one of the most memorable. There are so many classic moments in this film but the majority of the credit has to go to Garbo who is simply wonderful. The stern way she plays this character is just so funny and her line deliveries are flawless. When it comes time for the character to break and have some fun the actress pulls this off remarkably well. It also helps that Douglas is so great in the film and perfectly plays off the actress. Ina Claire, Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, Alexander Granach and Bela Lugosi are also very good in their supporting parts. NINOTCHKA is full of wonderfully funny moments from start to finish and it's easy to see why it's considered such a classic of its genre.

    A stern Russian woman sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man who represents everything she is supposed to detest. In her second last movie, Greta Garbo plays the title character, and in doing so, she exceeds thoroughly. Ninotchka is a hilarious and laugh-filled romantic comedy, and one of Garbo's best. I saw this movie a very long time ago, and I watched it again recently because I didn't remember it that much, and when I watched it again, I certainly had a fun time, as I was laughing quite a lot. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas were superb in their roles, and not only that, but there was also a good amount of chemistry between the two, they were perfect, I don't know if I can think of anybody who could have done a better job than they did. This movie is a comedy masterpiece, it's one of the best comedies of all time, and one of the best movies of the 1930's! There are big laughs in this movie, as well as many passions, and of course, there is what you'd expect to see in a great movie like this, great writing, great directing, and especially, great acting! Sadly, after making one more movie, Greta Garbo would retire from acting. Melvyn Douglas however, would go on to further greatness. In 1963, he would win is first Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Hud, and then in 1979, he would win his second Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Being There. In addition to Garbo and Douglas, the supporting cast is also noteworthy, the two biggest examples are Bela Lugosi (who as you know, is famous for playing Dracula, and being in a lot of Ed Wood's movies later in his career) and Sig Ruman (who appeared in White Christmas, Stalag 17, and numerous movies with the Marx Brothers). But as you might have already known, the best ones in the movie are of course, Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, especially the former. It's a pity that Garbo retired soon after this, as she was one of the few actresses who was successful after the era of silent movies. Ninotchka is the perfect romantic comedy to spend one hour and fifty minutes watching, as it's got exactly what you would expect to see in a great romantic comedy, laughs, passions, great directing, great acting, and great writing. There are a lot of funny scenes, such as the restaurant scene and the ending (which I am not going to say what it is because it would spoil things), not to mention the part where they climb up the Eiffel Tower. So if you are looking for a great romantic comedy to watch and laugh at, then join Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas for 1939's Ninotchka, which is yet another great movie released in what many people consider to be the greatest year for movies. And by the way, the script of this movie was co-written by Billy Wilder, who would later write and direct classics like The Lost Weekend, The Apartment, Stalag 17, and The Fortune Cookie. In short, Ninotchka is a great comedy, one somebody watches it, it will be impossible for them not to laugh at least once. 10/10

    "Ninotchka" is one of the funniest movies ever made. But it's not a slapstick or screwball comedy. It is in the class of "It Happened One Night," "My Man Godfry," and "Holiday." The humor is in snappy dialog. The one-liners, subtle zingers, and satire poke fun mostly at Soviet Russia and communism. But it has occasional jabs at capitalism and western lifestyles  notably the idle rich. The movie is superb in all aspects, especially in the script, direction, settings and acting. All of the cast give top performances. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas are the perfect match for some of the funniest repartee ever put on film. But, how Garbo (Ninotchka) could keep a straight face in those exchanges, one after another, is beyond me. I'll bet MGM had to do many retakes of some of her scenes. If not for her breaking down, then for the cracking up of Douglas (Leon) or others on the set and behind the camera. "Ninotchka" is one of the great comedy-romances for the ages. Young and old alike can enjoy it. But, from some of the comments I've read, it seems much of the humor is lost without a little knowledge of the time. So, I offer these tidbits to help set the stage and prepare viewers for a most enjoyable film. The time is the late 1930s. The story takes place mostly in Paris, moves to Moscow later, and ends in Istanbul. In 1939, all the world knows about Soviet Russia and many of its problems. It has been in the news since the communist takeover after the revolutions 20 years earlier. Joseph Stalin's five-year plan for recovery since 1922 was past its 15th year. So far, it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine, the Russian people faced starvation. But that's not all. The Great Purge of 1936-38 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia, a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe, especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus, the stage is set for "Ninotchka." With the large number of reviews posted up to this time, I wouldn't normally add my own. But, I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more  and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene, Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is "peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time." She says, "Our next year's crop is in danger, and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors, there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades." What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets. Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, "I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this." And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. "Which part of the room is mine?" Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, "You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite." One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, "How are things in Moscow?" Garbo replied, "Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians." A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, "I give you my word, they were confiscated legally." In a caf&eacute; later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, "Now what shall it be?" She says, "Raw beets and carrots." He replies, "Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow." She next says, "Bring me something simple  I never think about food." The waiter asks, "If you don't think about food, what do you think about?" Ninotchka answers, "The future of the common people." And the waiter replies, "That's also a question of food." What a great running dialog! "Ninotchka" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, "Ninotchka" likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were "Gone With the Wind," "Stagecoach," Goodbye, Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "The Wizard of Oz," "Ninotchka," "Wuthering Heights," "Dark Victory," "Beau Geste," "Of Mice and Men," "Young Mr. Lincoln," "Gunga Din," "The Four Feathers," "Only Angels Have Wings," and "Bachelor Mother." Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating (on September 20, 2012) of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?

The story of four Soviet spies and their antics in the France capital is the ultimate depiction of the atmosphere in Europe in the shadow of the upcoming war. We can feel the ambiguous attitude of the American people (and furthermore Lubitsch and Wilder as European immigrants) toward the Soviets in the unfolding events of Nazi aggressiveness in Europe. Paris's seductive as it can be, Garbo shine above all and the movie is fun to watch even from seven decades forward. To my opinion, someone who want to introduce himself with this 'Golden Age' of Hollywood cinema can easily be exposed by this film.

    A stern Russian woman (Greta Garbo) sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man (Melvyn Douglas) who represents everything she is supposed to detest. The way Soviet Russia is portrayed here is quite strange. We have Ninotchka saying an old man looks "sad" and should not be working, she has a strict adherence to custom and regulation. And censorship completely blocks out the letters of friends. While I do not think this is completely off-base, surely this is exaggerated. (Of course, in some ways, the situation was probably far worse.) I love that this has a Billy Wilder script. Wilder learned a lot from director Lubitsch and went on to direct some of the greatest films out there (I would argue that Wilder surpassed Lubitsch in greatness). We also get a great appearance (although all too small) of the legendary Bela Lugosi.

    From director Ernst Lubitsch (To Be or Not to Be, Heaven Can Wait), I had heard the leading actress name a few times, I didn't know much about her, especially not that she retired at the age of thirty five after only twenty eight films, and I was looking forward to this title I recognised from her career. Basically in Paris, France, three Russians, Iranov (Sig Ruman), Buljanov (Felix Bressart) and Kopalsky (Alexander Granach), are selling jewellery from the aristocracy that they confiscated during the 1917 Russian Revolution, and arriving they meet Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) who is trying to retrieve her jewellery back for Russian Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire). But he corrupts the three men and convinces them to stay in Paris since they have become accustomed to their French surroundings, so special diplomatic agent Nina Ivanovna "Ninotchka" Yakushova (Oscar nominated Greta Garbo) has been sent by the Soviet Union to make sure the sale goes ahead and bring the three men back to Russia. She is stern and non nonsense with her attitude, and for a while she has no time to mess around with pleasure rather than business, but after meeting Leon and being introduced more to the culture of the West she lightens up. Ninotchka and Leon slowly fall in love with each other, and this allows the three Russians to do a kindness for capitalism, and in the end the Russian agent leaves behind her work to have a relationship with the Count, and one of the three men protects that the other two were unfair to him, this is a joke. Also starring Bela Lugosi as Commissar Razinin and Gregory Gaye as Count Alexis Rakonin. Garbo gives a great performance as the first strict and then light-hearted Russian agent, and Douglas is likable as the charming man and love interest, I will confess that I could not understand the political stuff and I could not follow everything going on, but I did laugh when the jokes were simple and well made, the most funny material is during the caf&eacute; scene, and the love story is nice, so it was an fun sophisticated comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Writing, Original Story and Best Writing, Screenplay. Greta Garbo was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 44 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 52 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    NINOTCHKA (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, ranks one of the finest comedies to emerge in what's regarded to be Hollywood's greatest year, 1939. It was also that very year where certain top-rated stars, having gone through a declining period, would recapture the status they once acquired some time ago. The legendary Greta Garbo happened to be one of them. After playing tragic heroines for MGM dating back to the silent era of 1926, it was time for Garbo to either retire following her last screen appearance of CONQUEST (1937), or do something completely different. A Garbo musical might have been interesting, but quite unlikely. A western? Not quite. Garbo in pistols and petticoats would definitely not be her style, though it did work for Marlene Dietrich in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN. A murder mystery? Perhaps. Or at least another love story might suffice? The next best thing to reinventing the Garbo image turned out to be a comedy. Screwball comedies were highly successful and common place during the latter half of the thirties. For this comedy, however, it had to be both funny and agreeable to public taste. Funny and agreeable it was. Under stylish direction from the man known for his "Lubitsch touch," and excellent scripting by Charles Bracket, Billy Wilder and Walter Reich, the comedy in question resulted to the title character bearing the Russian name of NINOTCHKA. Opening title: "This picture takes place in Paris in those wonderful days when a siren was a brunette and not an alarm - and if a Frenchman turns out the light, it was not on account of an air raid!" The story opens with Russian comrades, Buljanoff (Felix Bressart), Iranoff (Sig Rumann) and Kopakski (Alexander Granach), in Paris, on a mission from the Soviet Government to sell jewels once belonging to the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) with the money used for farm machinery. Their assignment is soon forgotten as the trio enjoy themselves in the company of beautiful barmaids. Also at the luxurious hotel is Alexis Rakonin (Gregory Gaye), a Russian count posing as a waiter, who informs the Grand Duchess of their activities. Swana then has her lover, Count Leon D'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), to assist by both filing a court injunction to prevent the selling of the jewels as well as showing the comrades a good time in order to forget why they're in Paris in the first place. Due to the long delay, the Soviet sends Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, better known as Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), to investigate. Having met Ninotchka at a crosswalk, Leon, unaware of her identity, immediately becomes fascinated by her. During her stay in Paris, Leon does everything to entertain her, from escorting her to the top of the Eiffel Tower to endless attempts in trying to make her laugh. When Ninotchka finally transforms into a new woman, trading her beret for a modern hat, she, too, forgets her assignment by concentrating on Leon. When Ninotchka mysteriously returns to Russia, Leon tries to follow her there, but is unable to obtain a Visa. For Garbo's introduction in American comedy, NINOTCHKA comes no better than this. She earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for her performance. What makes NINOTCHKA work so well is the way Garbo delivers her comedy lines, in the same manner of her dramatic roles. Enacting it in a straightforward manner with no attempts of being funny is the secret to the hilarity. The more serious she is, the funnier she becomes. Of the many classic lines delivered here, with one being a little "in-joke" pertaining to Garbo's classic tag line of "wanting to be alone," the one that should get honorable mention is, "Do you want to see my wound." For Garbo's male co-star, Melvyn Douglas proved to be a most logical choice. His most classic scene comes as he helps his leading lady fulfill her much publicized slogan, "Garbo laughs!" She's laughed before on screen, but never so hysterically. A pity the Garbo-Douglas reunion comedy of TWO FACED WOMAN (1941) didn't earn the same reputation as NINOTCHKA. The now forgotten Ina Claire, better known more for her theatrical than screen performances, gives a good account of herself as the Duchess. It's a wonder how the sophisticated Genevieve Tobin might have done had she assumed that very same role. Horror movie fans will be surprised in finding the fourth-billed Bela Lugosi appearing as the Russian Commissar Razinin. Even more surprising how his one and only scene opposite Garbo to not only come very late into the 111 minute story, but one lasting a little less three minutes! As much as NINOTCHKA has been imitated and recycled throughout the years, only the musical remake, SILK STOCKINGS (MGM, 1957) starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse (Ninotchka) comes close in recapturing the success of the original. Distributed to video cassette in the mid 1980s and later onto DVD, viewers can capture a glimpse of the legendary Garbo laughing (and showing off her wound) in one of cable TV's many broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies.

    My only other experience of Garbo was in the 1925 silent film "The Joyless Street", a rather somber picture that featured her charisma with strong body language and facial expressiveness. Apparently the tag line 'Garbo Laughs' was meant to convey a change in character from her ensuing screen roles, but it takes a while to get there. It's only when her charmingly aggressive suitor (Melvyn Douglas) falls out of his chair that the stuffy Nina Ivanova Yakushova breaks character and reveals a human being underneath a commissar's clothing. The film is billed as a comedy, but it's not of the laugh out loud variety. The film delivers it's humor in the witty dialog between Garbo and Douglas, along with the calculated antics of the three apparatchiks Ninotchka has been sent to spy on and see that their mission is successful. I don't know if the title 'Envoy Extraordinaire" was a legitimate one, but Garbo takes it seriously, to the point of declining a railroad porter to take her bags, citing the 'social injustice' of it all. There are a handful of these ideological viewpoints woven into the script; another was Ninotchka's observation that as a capitalist, Douglas's Leon D'Algout was the product of a doomed culture. Personally, I enjoyed the film, though I had a sense that it started to drag at the ninety minute mark or so. The resolution of the romance between Ninotchka and Leon would have required the Russian comrade to defect so in that respect it seemed somewhat contrived. But not any more so than having the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) simply give away here jeweled fortune to entice her rival away from Paris.

    Ninotchka (1939) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Terrific romantic-comedy about a stern Russian named Ninotchka (Greta Garbo) who is sent to Paris to look in on three men who were unable to sell some jewelry due to some legal issues. Once there Ninotchka strikes up a relationship with Leon (Melvyn Douglas) who has his own reasons for wanting the jewels. Director Ernst Lubitsch hits all the right moves with this film and turns it into one of the best of its type. It's easy to see why so many people consider 1939 to be the greatest year for movies and this one here is another one of the jewels from that era. Although I'd stop short of calling this a masterpiece, there's still no question that it features a legend at the top of her game and a terrific supporting cast around her. It's funny to see the original advertisements talk about Garbo laughing since this was a very rare thing. Just like her first talking picture, which MGM played up, the moment here when she finally laughs is just a classic scene and one of the most memorable. There are so many classic moments in this film but the majority of the credit has to go to Garbo who is simply wonderful. The stern way she plays this character is just so funny and her line deliveries are flawless. When it comes time for the character to break and have some fun the actress pulls this off remarkably well. It also helps that Douglas is so great in the film and perfectly plays off the actress. Ina Claire, Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, Alexander Granach and Bela Lugosi are also very good in their supporting parts. NINOTCHKA is full of wonderfully funny moments from start to finish and it's easy to see why it's considered such a classic of its genre.

    A stern Russian woman sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man who represents everything she is supposed to detest. In her second last movie, Greta Garbo plays the title character, and in doing so, she exceeds thoroughly. Ninotchka is a hilarious and laugh-filled romantic comedy, and one of Garbo's best. I saw this movie a very long time ago, and I watched it again recently because I didn't remember it that much, and when I watched it again, I certainly had a fun time, as I was laughing quite a lot. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas were superb in their roles, and not only that, but there was also a good amount of chemistry between the two, they were perfect, I don't know if I can think of anybody who could have done a better job than they did. This movie is a comedy masterpiece, it's one of the best comedies of all time, and one of the best movies of the 1930's! There are big laughs in this movie, as well as many passions, and of course, there is what you'd expect to see in a great movie like this, great writing, great directing, and especially, great acting! Sadly, after making one more movie, Greta Garbo would retire from acting. Melvyn Douglas however, would go on to further greatness. In 1963, he would win is first Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Hud, and then in 1979, he would win his second Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Being There. In addition to Garbo and Douglas, the supporting cast is also noteworthy, the two biggest examples are Bela Lugosi (who as you know, is famous for playing Dracula, and being in a lot of Ed Wood's movies later in his career) and Sig Ruman (who appeared in White Christmas, Stalag 17, and numerous movies with the Marx Brothers). But as you might have already known, the best ones in the movie are of course, Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, especially the former. It's a pity that Garbo retired soon after this, as she was one of the few actresses who was successful after the era of silent movies. Ninotchka is the perfect romantic comedy to spend one hour and fifty minutes watching, as it's got exactly what you would expect to see in a great romantic comedy, laughs, passions, great directing, great acting, and great writing. There are a lot of funny scenes, such as the restaurant scene and the ending (which I am not going to say what it is because it would spoil things), not to mention the part where they climb up the Eiffel Tower. So if you are looking for a great romantic comedy to watch and laugh at, then join Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas for 1939's Ninotchka, which is yet another great movie released in what many people consider to be the greatest year for movies. And by the way, the script of this movie was co-written by Billy Wilder, who would later write and direct classics like The Lost Weekend, The Apartment, Stalag 17, and The Fortune Cookie. In short, Ninotchka is a great comedy, one somebody watches it, it will be impossible for them not to laugh at least once. 10/10

    "Ninotchka" is one of the funniest movies ever made. But it's not a slapstick or screwball comedy. It is in the class of "It Happened One Night," "My Man Godfry," and "Holiday." The humor is in snappy dialog. The one-liners, subtle zingers, and satire poke fun mostly at Soviet Russia and communism. But it has occasional jabs at capitalism and western lifestyles  notably the idle rich. The movie is superb in all aspects, especially in the script, direction, settings and acting. All of the cast give top performances. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas are the perfect match for some of the funniest repartee ever put on film. But, how Garbo (Ninotchka) could keep a straight face in those exchanges, one after another, is beyond me. I'll bet MGM had to do many retakes of some of her scenes. If not for her breaking down, then for the cracking up of Douglas (Leon) or others on the set and behind the camera. "Ninotchka" is one of the great comedy-romances for the ages. Young and old alike can enjoy it. But, from some of the comments I've read, it seems much of the humor is lost without a little knowledge of the time. So, I offer these tidbits to help set the stage and prepare viewers for a most enjoyable film. The time is the late 1930s. The story takes place mostly in Paris, moves to Moscow later, and ends in Istanbul. In 1939, all the world knows about Soviet Russia and many of its problems. It has been in the news since the communist takeover after the revolutions 20 years earlier. Joseph Stalin's five-year plan for recovery since 1922 was past its 15th year. So far, it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine, the Russian people faced starvation. But that's not all. The Great Purge of 1936-38 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia, a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe, especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus, the stage is set for "Ninotchka." With the large number of reviews posted up to this time, I wouldn't normally add my own. But, I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more  and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene, Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is "peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time." She says, "Our next year's crop is in danger, and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors, there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades." What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets. Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, "I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this." And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. "Which part of the room is mine?" Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, "You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite." One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, "How are things in Moscow?" Garbo replied, "Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians." A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, "I give you my word, they were confiscated legally." In a caf&eacute; later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, "Now what shall it be?" She says, "Raw beets and carrots." He replies, "Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow." She next says, "Bring me something simple  I never think about food." The waiter asks, "If you don't think about food, what do you think about?" Ninotchka answers, "The future of the common people." And the waiter replies, "That's also a question of food." What a great running dialog! "Ninotchka" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, "Ninotchka" likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were "Gone With the Wind," "Stagecoach," Goodbye, Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "The Wizard of Oz," "Ninotchka," "Wuthering Heights," "Dark Victory," "Beau Geste," "Of Mice and Men," "Young Mr. Lincoln," "Gunga Din," "The Four Feathers," "Only Angels Have Wings," and "Bachelor Mother." Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating (on September 20, 2012) of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?

    If anyone believes that Greta Garbo could not do comedy, then watch this movie. Not only does Ms. Garbo do comedy, she makes people laugh. In fact, her performance is at times hilarious. This movie, which is a satire of the Soviet system, is brilliant. Besides being funny, the chemistry between Ms. Garbo and her co-star Melvyn Douglas is great. He and Ms. Garbo make a great comedy team. And the story itself is wonderful. Using the Soviet Union as the source of jokes is risky but the movie deals with the subject in an entertaining manner. Ms. Garbo is beautiful, witty, poignant and charming. The rest of the cast is also superb, and combined with excellent cinematography and a strong script, they combine to produce an excellent movie.

    It is a very strange film. Charming comedy, ironic picture of Soviet Union before Cold War , a political satire and a nice story, memorable characters and funny situations. But more that, final step for Garbo which creates a magnificent role. In fact, it is not an old movie but a good bye party. Fall of a Hollywood way to build a subject, lost of innocence, science to create public. And the cause is not the war . Or fashion. But a strange expectation of reality reflection. New stars and new type of film. New bones for heroic movies and new skin for comedies. End of adolescence and new speech about ordinary aspects of life. Spell is more insignificant and the budget of a movie is the real star.Greta Garbo is the seal of this lost kingdom. That film is one of important epitaphs.

Due to the long delay, the Soviet sends Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, better known as Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), to investigate. Having met Ninotchka at a crosswalk, Leon, unaware of her identity, immediately becomes fascinated by her. During her stay in Paris, Leon does everything to entertain her, from escorting her to the top of the Eiffel Tower to endless attempts in trying to make her laugh. When Ninotchka finally transforms into a new woman, trading her beret for a modern hat, she, too, forgets her assignment by concentrating on Leon. When Ninotchka mysteriously returns to Russia, Leon tries to follow her there, but is unable to obtain a Visa. For Garbo's introduction in American comedy, NINOTCHKA comes no better than this. She earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for her performance. What makes NINOTCHKA work so well is the way Garbo delivers her comedy lines, in the same manner of her dramatic roles. Enacting it in a straightforward manner with no attempts of being funny is the secret to the hilarity. The more serious she is, the funnier she becomes. Of the many classic lines delivered here, with one being a little "in-joke" pertaining to Garbo's classic tag line of "wanting to be alone," the one that should get honorable mention is, "Do you want to see my wound." For Garbo's male co-star, Melvyn Douglas proved to be a most logical choice. His most classic scene comes as he helps his leading lady fulfill her much publicized slogan, "Garbo laughs!" She's laughed before on screen, but never so hysterically. A pity the Garbo-Douglas reunion comedy of TWO FACED WOMAN (1941) didn't earn the same reputation as NINOTCHKA. The now forgotten Ina Claire, better known more for her theatrical than screen performances, gives a good account of herself as the Duchess. It's a wonder how the sophisticated Genevieve Tobin might have done had she assumed that very same role. Horror movie fans will be surprised in finding the fourth-billed Bela Lugosi appearing as the Russian Commissar Razinin. Even more surprising how his one and only scene opposite Garbo to not only come very late into the 111 minute story, but one lasting a little less three minutes! As much as NINOTCHKA has been imitated and recycled throughout the years, only the musical remake, SILK STOCKINGS (MGM, 1957) starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse (Ninotchka) comes close in recapturing the success of the original. Distributed to video cassette in the mid 1980s and later onto DVD, viewers can capture a glimpse of the legendary Garbo laughing (and showing off her wound) in one of cable TV's many broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies.

    My only other experience of Garbo was in the 1925 silent film "The Joyless Street", a rather somber picture that featured her charisma with strong body language and facial expressiveness. Apparently the tag line 'Garbo Laughs' was meant to convey a change in character from her ensuing screen roles, but it takes a while to get there. It's only when her charmingly aggressive suitor (Melvyn Douglas) falls out of his chair that the stuffy Nina Ivanova Yakushova breaks character and reveals a human being underneath a commissar's clothing. The film is billed as a comedy, but it's not of the laugh out loud variety. The film delivers it's humor in the witty dialog between Garbo and Douglas, along with the calculated antics of the three apparatchiks Ninotchka has been sent to spy on and see that their mission is successful. I don't know if the title 'Envoy Extraordinaire" was a legitimate one, but Garbo takes it seriously, to the point of declining a railroad porter to take her bags, citing the 'social injustice' of it all. There are a handful of these ideological viewpoints woven into the script; another was Ninotchka's observation that as a capitalist, Douglas's Leon D'Algout was the product of a doomed culture. Personally, I enjoyed the film, though I had a sense that it started to drag at the ninety minute mark or so. The resolution of the romance between Ninotchka and Leon would have required the Russian comrade to defect so in that respect it seemed somewhat contrived. But not any more so than having the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) simply give away here jeweled fortune to entice her rival away from Paris.

    Ninotchka (1939) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Terrific romantic-comedy about a stern Russian named Ninotchka (Greta Garbo) who is sent to Paris to look in on three men who were unable to sell some jewelry due to some legal issues. Once there Ninotchka strikes up a relationship with Leon (Melvyn Douglas) who has his own reasons for wanting the jewels. Director Ernst Lubitsch hits all the right moves with this film and turns it into one of the best of its type. It's easy to see why so many people consider 1939 to be the greatest year for movies and this one here is another one of the jewels from that era. Although I'd stop short of calling this a masterpiece, there's still no question that it features a legend at the top of her game and a terrific supporting cast around her. It's funny to see the original advertisements talk about Garbo laughing since this was a very rare thing. Just like her first talking picture, which MGM played up, the moment here when she finally laughs is just a classic scene and one of the most memorable. There are so many classic moments in this film but the majority of the credit has to go to Garbo who is simply wonderful. The stern way she plays this character is just so funny and her line deliveries are flawless. When it comes time for the character to break and have some fun the actress pulls this off remarkably well. It also helps that Douglas is so great in the film and perfectly plays off the actress. Ina Claire, Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, Alexander Granach and Bela Lugosi are also very good in their supporting parts. NINOTCHKA is full of wonderfully funny moments from start to finish and it's easy to see why it's considered such a classic of its genre.

    A stern Russian woman sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man who represents everything she is supposed to detest. In her second last movie, Greta Garbo plays the title character, and in doing so, she exceeds thoroughly. Ninotchka is a hilarious and laugh-filled romantic comedy, and one of Garbo's best. I saw this movie a very long time ago, and I watched it again recently because I didn't remember it that much, and when I watched it again, I certainly had a fun time, as I was laughing quite a lot. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas were superb in their roles, and not only that, but there was also a good amount of chemistry between the two, they were perfect, I don't know if I can think of anybody who could have done a better job than they did. This movie is a comedy masterpiece, it's one of the best comedies of all time, and one of the best movies of the 1930's! There are big laughs in this movie, as well as many passions, and of course, there is what you'd expect to see in a great movie like this, great writing, great directing, and especially, great acting! Sadly, after making one more movie, Greta Garbo would retire from acting. Melvyn Douglas however, would go on to further greatness. In 1963, he would win is first Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Hud, and then in 1979, he would win his second Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Being There. In addition to Garbo and Douglas, the supporting cast is also noteworthy, the two biggest examples are Bela Lugosi (who as you know, is famous for playing Dracula, and being in a lot of Ed Wood's movies later in his career) and Sig Ruman (who appeared in White Christmas, Stalag 17, and numerous movies with the Marx Brothers). But as you might have already known, the best ones in the movie are of course, Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, especially the former. It's a pity that Garbo retired soon after this, as she was one of the few actresses who was successful after the era of silent movies. Ninotchka is the perfect romantic comedy to spend one hour and fifty minutes watching, as it's got exactly what you would expect to see in a great romantic comedy, laughs, passions, great directing, great acting, and great writing. There are a lot of funny scenes, such as the restaurant scene and the ending (which I am not going to say what it is because it would spoil things), not to mention the part where they climb up the Eiffel Tower. So if you are looking for a great romantic comedy to watch and laugh at, then join Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas for 1939's Ninotchka, which is yet another great movie released in what many people consider to be the greatest year for movies. And by the way, the script of this movie was co-written by Billy Wilder, who would later write and direct classics like The Lost Weekend, The Apartment, Stalag 17, and The Fortune Cookie. In short, Ninotchka is a great comedy, one somebody watches it, it will be impossible for them not to laugh at least once. 10/10

    "Ninotchka" is one of the funniest movies ever made. But it's not a slapstick or screwball comedy. It is in the class of "It Happened One Night," "My Man Godfry," and "Holiday." The humor is in snappy dialog. The one-liners, subtle zingers, and satire poke fun mostly at Soviet Russia and communism. But it has occasional jabs at capitalism and western lifestyles  notably the idle rich. The movie is superb in all aspects, especially in the script, direction, settings and acting. All of the cast give top performances. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas are the perfect match for some of the funniest repartee ever put on film. But, how Garbo (Ninotchka) could keep a straight face in those exchanges, one after another, is beyond me. I'll bet MGM had to do many retakes of some of her scenes. If not for her breaking down, then for the cracking up of Douglas (Leon) or others on the set and behind the camera. "Ninotchka" is one of the great comedy-romances for the ages. Young and old alike can enjoy it. But, from some of the comments I've read, it seems much of the humor is lost without a little knowledge of the time. So, I offer these tidbits to help set the stage and prepare viewers for a most enjoyable film. The time is the late 1930s. The story takes place mostly in Paris, moves to Moscow later, and ends in Istanbul. In 1939, all the world knows about Soviet Russia and many of its problems. It has been in the news since the communist takeover after the revolutions 20 years earlier. Joseph Stalin's five-year plan for recovery since 1922 was past its 15th year. So far, it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine, the Russian people faced starvation. But that's not all. The Great Purge of 1936-38 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia, a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe, especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus, the stage is set for "Ninotchka." With the large number of reviews posted up to this time, I wouldn't normally add my own. But, I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more  and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene, Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is "peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time." She says, "Our next year's crop is in danger, and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors, there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades." What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets. Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, "I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this." And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. "Which part of the room is mine?" Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, "You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite." One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, "How are things in Moscow?" Garbo replied, "Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians." A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, "I give you my word, they were confiscated legally." In a caf&eacute; later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, "Now what shall it be?" She says, "Raw beets and carrots." He replies, "Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow." She next says, "Bring me something simple  I never think about food." The waiter asks, "If you don't think about food, what do you think about?" Ninotchka answers, "The future of the common people." And the waiter replies, "That's also a question of food." What a great running dialog! "Ninotchka" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, "Ninotchka" likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were "Gone With the Wind," "Stagecoach," Goodbye, Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "The Wizard of Oz," "Ninotchka," "Wuthering Heights," "Dark Victory," "Beau Geste," "Of Mice and Men," "Young Mr. Lincoln," "Gunga Din," "The Four Feathers," "Only Angels Have Wings," and "Bachelor Mother." Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating (on September 20, 2012) of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?

    If anyone believes that Greta Garbo could not do comedy, then watch this movie. Not only does Ms. Garbo do comedy, she makes people laugh. In fact, her performance is at times hilarious. This movie, which is a satire of the Soviet system, is brilliant. Besides being funny, the chemistry between Ms. Garbo and her co-star Melvyn Douglas is great. He and Ms. Garbo make a great comedy team. And the story itself is wonderful. Using the Soviet Union as the source of jokes is risky but the movie deals with the subject in an entertaining manner. Ms. Garbo is beautiful, witty, poignant and charming. The rest of the cast is also superb, and combined with excellent cinematography and a strong script, they combine to produce an excellent movie.

    It is a very strange film. Charming comedy, ironic picture of Soviet Union before Cold War , a political satire and a nice story, memorable characters and funny situations. But more that, final step for Garbo which creates a magnificent role. In fact, it is not an old movie but a good bye party. Fall of a Hollywood way to build a subject, lost of innocence, science to create public. And the cause is not the war . Or fashion. But a strange expectation of reality reflection. New stars and new type of film. New bones for heroic movies and new skin for comedies. End of adolescence and new speech about ordinary aspects of life. Spell is more insignificant and the budget of a movie is the real star.Greta Garbo is the seal of this lost kingdom. That film is one of important epitaphs.

    Garbo performance is immaculate in her biggest comedy role, Melvyn Douglas supporting role is also very good, he enhance Garbo perfectly. Ernst Lubitsch as director accompanied by his friend Billy Wilder as screenwriter gave us entertainment and satire in her best elegant form. The story of four Soviet spies and their antics in the France capital is the ultimate depiction of the atmosphere in Europe in the shadow of the upcoming war. We can feel the ambiguous attitude of the American people (and furthermore Lubitsch and Wilder as European immigrants) toward the Soviets in the unfolding events of Nazi aggressiveness in Europe. Paris's seductive as it can be, Garbo shine above all and the movie is fun to watch even from seven decades forward. To my opinion, someone who want to introduce himself with this 'Golden Age' of Hollywood cinema can easily be exposed by this film.

    A stern Russian woman (Greta Garbo) sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man (Melvyn Douglas) who represents everything she is supposed to detest. The way Soviet Russia is portrayed here is quite strange. We have Ninotchka saying an old man looks "sad" and should not be working, she has a strict adherence to custom and regulation. And censorship completely blocks out the letters of friends. While I do not think this is completely off-base, surely this is exaggerated. (Of course, in some ways, the situation was probably far worse.) I love that this has a Billy Wilder script. Wilder learned a lot from director Lubitsch and went on to direct some of the greatest films out there (I would argue that Wilder surpassed Lubitsch in greatness). We also get a great appearance (although all too small) of the legendary Bela Lugosi.

    From director Ernst Lubitsch (To Be or Not to Be, Heaven Can Wait), I had heard the leading actress name a few times, I didn't know much about her, especially not that she retired at the age of thirty five after only twenty eight films, and I was looking forward to this title I recognised from her career. Basically in Paris, France, three Russians, Iranov (Sig Ruman), Buljanov (Felix Bressart) and Kopalsky (Alexander Granach), are selling jewellery from the aristocracy that they confiscated during the 1917 Russian Revolution, and arriving they meet Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) who is trying to retrieve her jewellery back for Russian Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire). But he corrupts the three men and convinces them to stay in Paris since they have become accustomed to their French surroundings, so special diplomatic agent Nina Ivanovna "Ninotchka" Yakushova (Oscar nominated Greta Garbo) has been sent by the Soviet Union to make sure the sale goes ahead and bring the three men back to Russia. She is stern and non nonsense with her attitude, and for a while she has no time to mess around with pleasure rather than business, but after meeting Leon and being introduced more to the culture of the West she lightens up. Ninotchka and Leon slowly fall in love with each other, and this allows the three Russians to do a kindness for capitalism, and in the end the Russian agent leaves behind her work to have a relationship with the Count, and one of the three men protects that the other two were unfair to him, this is a joke. Also starring Bela Lugosi as Commissar Razinin and Gregory Gaye as Count Alexis Rakonin. Garbo gives a great performance as the first strict and then light-hearted Russian agent, and Douglas is likable as the charming man and love interest, I will confess that I could not understand the political stuff and I could not follow everything going on, but I did laugh when the jokes were simple and well made, the most funny material is during the caf&eacute; scene, and the love story is nice, so it was an fun sophisticated comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Writing, Original Story and Best Writing, Screenplay. Greta Garbo was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 44 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 52 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    NINOTCHKA (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, ranks one of the finest comedies to emerge in what's regarded to be Hollywood's greatest year, 1939. It was also that very year where certain top-rated stars, having gone through a declining period, would recapture the status they once acquired some time ago. The legendary Greta Garbo happened to be one of them. After playing tragic heroines for MGM dating back to the silent era of 1926, it was time for Garbo to either retire following her last screen appearance of CONQUEST (1937), or do something completely different. A Garbo musical might have been interesting, but quite unlikely. A western? Not quite. Garbo in pistols and petticoats would definitely not be her style, though it did work for Marlene Dietrich in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN. A murder mystery? Perhaps. Or at least another love story might suffice? The next best thing to reinventing the Garbo image turned out to be a comedy. Screwball comedies were highly successful and common place during the latter half of the thirties. For this comedy, however, it had to be both funny and agreeable to public taste. Funny and agreeable it was. Under stylish direction from the man known for his "Lubitsch touch," and excellent scripting by Charles Bracket, Billy Wilder and Walter Reich, the comedy in question resulted to the title character bearing the Russian name of NINOTCHKA. Opening title: "This picture takes place in Paris in those wonderful days when a siren was a brunette and not an alarm - and if a Frenchman turns out the light, it was not on account of an air raid!" The story opens with Russian comrades, Buljanoff (Felix Bressart), Iranoff (Sig Rumann) and Kopakski (Alexander Granach), in Paris, on a mission from the Soviet Government to sell jewels once belonging to the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) with the money used for farm machinery. Their assignment is soon forgotten as the trio enjoy themselves in the company of beautiful barmaids. Also at the luxurious hotel is Alexis Rakonin (Gregory Gaye), a Russian count posing as a waiter, who informs the Grand Duchess of their activities. Swana then has her lover, Count Leon D'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), to assist by both filing a court injunction to prevent the selling of the jewels as well as showing the comrades a good time in order to forget why they're in Paris in the first place. Due to the long delay, the Soviet sends Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, better known as Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), to investigate. Having met Ninotchka at a crosswalk, Leon, unaware of her identity, immediately becomes fascinated by her. During her stay in Paris, Leon does everything to entertain her, from escorting her to the top of the Eiffel Tower to endless attempts in trying to make her laugh. When Ninotchka finally transforms into a new woman, trading her beret for a modern hat, she, too, forgets her assignment by concentrating on Leon. When Ninotchka mysteriously returns to Russia, Leon tries to follow her there, but is unable to obtain a Visa. For Garbo's introduction in American comedy, NINOTCHKA comes no better than this. She earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for her performance. What makes NINOTCHKA work so well is the way Garbo delivers her comedy lines, in the same manner of her dramatic roles. Enacting it in a straightforward manner with no attempts of being funny is the secret to the hilarity. The more serious she is, the funnier she becomes. Of the many classic lines delivered here, with one being a little "in-joke" pertaining to Garbo's classic tag line of "wanting to be alone," the one that should get honorable mention is, "Do you want to see my wound." For Garbo's male co-star, Melvyn Douglas proved to be a most logical choice. His most classic scene comes as he helps his leading lady fulfill her much publicized slogan, "Garbo laughs!" She's laughed before on screen, but never so hysterically. A pity the Garbo-Douglas reunion comedy of TWO FACED WOMAN (1941) didn't earn the same reputation as NINOTCHKA. The now forgotten Ina Claire, better known more for her theatrical than screen performances, gives a good account of herself as the Duchess. It's a wonder how the sophisticated Genevieve Tobin might have done had she assumed that very same role. Horror movie fans will be surprised in finding the fourth-billed Bela Lugosi appearing as the Russian Commissar Razinin. Even more surprising how his one and only scene opposite Garbo to not only come very late into the 111 minute story, but one lasting a little less three minutes! As much as NINOTCHKA has been imitated and recycled throughout the years, only the musical remake, SILK STOCKINGS (MGM, 1957) starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse (Ninotchka) comes close in recapturing the success of the original. Distributed to video cassette in the mid 1980s and later onto DVD, viewers can capture a glimpse of the legendary Garbo laughing (and showing off her wound) in one of cable TV's many broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies.

    A stern Russian woman sent to Paris on official business finds herself attracted to a man who represents everything she is supposed to detest. In her second last movie, Greta Garbo plays the title character, and in doing so, she exceeds thoroughly. Ninotchka is a hilarious and laugh-filled romantic comedy, and one of Garbo's best. I saw this movie a very long time ago, and I watched it again recently because I didn't remember it that much, and when I watched it again, I certainly had a fun time, as I was laughing quite a lot. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas were superb in their roles, and not only that, but there was also a good amount of chemistry between the two, they were perfect, I don't know if I can think of anybody who could have done a better job than they did. This movie is a comedy masterpiece, it's one of the best comedies of all time, and one of the best movies of the 1930's! There are big laughs in this movie, as well as many passions, and of course, there is what you'd expect to see in a great movie like this, great writing, great directing, and especially, great acting! Sadly, after making one more movie, Greta Garbo would retire from acting. Melvyn Douglas however, would go on to further greatness. In 1963, he would win is first Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Hud, and then in 1979, he would win his second Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for his role in Being There. In addition to Garbo and Douglas, the supporting cast is also noteworthy, the two biggest examples are Bela Lugosi (who as you know, is famous for playing Dracula, and being in a lot of Ed Wood's movies later in his career) and Sig Ruman (who appeared in White Christmas, Stalag 17, and numerous movies with the Marx Brothers). But as you might have already known, the best ones in the movie are of course, Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, especially the former. It's a pity that Garbo retired soon after this, as she was one of the few actresses who was successful after the era of silent movies. Ninotchka is the perfect romantic comedy to spend one hour and fifty minutes watching, as it's got exactly what you would expect to see in a great romantic comedy, laughs, passions, great directing, great acting, and great writing. There are a lot of funny scenes, such as the restaurant scene and the ending (which I am not going to say what it is because it would spoil things), not to mention the part where they climb up the Eiffel Tower. So if you are looking for a great romantic comedy to watch and laugh at, then join Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas for 1939's Ninotchka, which is yet another great movie released in what many people consider to be the greatest year for movies. And by the way, the script of this movie was co-written by Billy Wilder, who would later write and direct classics like The Lost Weekend, The Apartment, Stalag 17, and The Fortune Cookie. In short, Ninotchka is a great comedy, one somebody watches it, it will be impossible for them not to laugh at least once. 10/10

    "Ninotchka" is one of the funniest movies ever made. But it's not a slapstick or screwball comedy. It is in the class of "It Happened One Night," "My Man Godfry," and "Holiday." The humor is in snappy dialog. The one-liners, subtle zingers, and satire poke fun mostly at Soviet Russia and communism. But it has occasional jabs at capitalism and western lifestyles  notably the idle rich. The movie is superb in all aspects, especially in the script, direction, settings and acting. All of the cast give top performances. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas are the perfect match for some of the funniest repartee ever put on film. But, how Garbo (Ninotchka) could keep a straight face in those exchanges, one after another, is beyond me. I'll bet MGM had to do many retakes of some of her scenes. If not for her breaking down, then for the cracking up of Douglas (Leon) or others on the set and behind the camera. "Ninotchka" is one of the great comedy-romances for the ages. Young and old alike can enjoy it. But, from some of the comments I've read, it seems much of the humor is lost without a little knowledge of the time. So, I offer these tidbits to help set the stage and prepare viewers for a most enjoyable film. The time is the late 1930s. The story takes place mostly in Paris, moves to Moscow later, and ends in Istanbul. In 1939, all the world knows about Soviet Russia and many of its problems. It has been in the news since the communist takeover after the revolutions 20 years earlier. Joseph Stalin's five-year plan for recovery since 1922 was past its 15th year. So far, it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine, the Russian people faced starvation. But that's not all. The Great Purge of 1936-38 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia, a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe, especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus, the stage is set for "Ninotchka." With the large number of reviews posted up to this time, I wouldn't normally add my own. But, I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more  and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene, Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is "peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time." She says, "Our next year's crop is in danger, and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors, there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades." What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets. Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, "I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this." And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. "Which part of the room is mine?" Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, "You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite." One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, "How are things in Moscow?" Garbo replied, "Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians." A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, "I give you my word, they were confiscated legally." In a caf&eacute; later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, "Now what shall it be?" She says, "Raw beets and carrots." He replies, "Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow." She next says, "Bring me something simple  I never think about food." The waiter asks, "If you don't think about food, what do you think about?" Ninotchka answers, "The future of the common people." And the waiter replies, "That's also a question of food." What a great running dialog! "Ninotchka" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, "Ninotchka" likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were "Gone With the Wind," "Stagecoach," Goodbye, Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "The Wizard of Oz," "Ninotchka," "Wuthering Heights," "Dark Victory," "Beau Geste," "Of Mice and Men," "Young Mr. Lincoln," "Gunga Din," "The Four Feathers," "Only Angels Have Wings," and "Bachelor Mother." Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating (on September 20, 2012) of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?

    If anyone believes that Greta Garbo could not do comedy, then watch this movie. Not only does Ms. Garbo do comedy, she makes people laugh. In fact, her performance is at times hilarious. This movie, which is a satire of the Soviet system, is brilliant. Besides being funny, the chemistry between Ms. Garbo and her co-star Melvyn Douglas is great. He and Ms. Garbo make a great comedy team. And the story itself is wonderful. Using the Soviet Union as the source of jokes is risky but the movie deals with the subject in an entertaining manner. Ms. Garbo is beautiful, witty, poignant and charming. The rest of the cast is also superb, and combined with excellent cinematography and a strong script, they combine to produce an excellent movie.

    It is a very strange film. Charming comedy, ironic picture of Soviet Union before Cold War , a political satire and a nice story, memorable characters and funny situations. But more that, final step for Garbo which creates a magnificent role. In fact, it is not an old movie but a good bye party. Fall of a Hollywood way to build a subject, lost of innocence, science to create public. And the cause is not the war . Or fashion. But a strange expectation of reality reflection. New stars and new type of film. New bones for heroic movies and new skin for comedies. End of adolescence and new speech about ordinary aspects of life. Spell is more insignificant and the budget of a movie is the real star.Greta Garbo is the seal of this lost kingdom. That film is one of important epitaphs.

    Garbo performance is immaculate in her biggest comedy role, Melvyn Douglas supporting role is also very good, he enhance Garbo perfectly. Ernst Lubitsch as director accompanied by his friend Billy Wilder as screenwriter gave us entertainment and satire in her best elegant form. The story of four Soviet spies and their antics in the France capital is the ultimate depiction of the atmosphere in Europe in the shadow of the upcoming war. We can feel the ambiguous attitude of the American people (and furthermore Lubitsch and Wilder as European immigrants) toward the Soviets in the unfolding events of Nazi aggressiveness in Europe. Paris's seductive as it can be, Garbo shine above all and the movie is fun to watch even from seven decades forward. To my opinion, someone who want to introduce himself with this 'Golden Age' of Hollywood cinema can easily be exposed by this film.
