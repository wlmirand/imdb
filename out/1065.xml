 <sinopse>
  A movie with no conventional plot: merely a collection of expertly photographed scenes. Subject matter has a highly environmental theme.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Koyaanisqatsi is a documentary (of sorts). It is also a visual concert of images set to the haunting music of 'Phillip Glass' . While there is no plot in the traditional sense, there is a definate scenario. The film opens on ancient native American cave drawings, while the soundtrack chants "Koyaanisqatsi" which is a Hopi indian term for "life out of balance". The film uses extensive time lapse photography (which speeds images up) and slow motion photography to make comparisons between different types of physical motion. In one of the first examples, we see cloud formations moving (sped up) intercut with a montage of ocean waves (slowed down) and in such a way we are able to see the similarities of movement between these natural forces. This technique of comparison exists throughout the film, and through it we learn more about the world around us. The film progresses from purely natural environments to nature as affected by man, and finally to man's own manmade environment, devoid of ...

    Videos strung together, coordinated with Phillip Glass' music. Nature (clouds, waves, mountains, shores) is described as beautiful, enduring, good. Humanity is ambushed as ugly, stupid, wasteful, enslaved, impoverished, ant-like, and injurious to the landscape. Cinematography: 5/10 I saw this in the late 1980s, and remember being quite impressed by the visuals. On the Hulu version I saw in 2013, I was not impressed at all. The focus was soft, the colors washed out, the contrast low. Incidental music: 5/10 Beyond irritating. When associated with humans in video, the music had the sort of manic activity one might associate with the Keystone Cops, but with oppressive overtones. Screenplay: 2/10 The point of view is 'nature is great, humanity is the opposite.'

    In the Hopi Language, Koyaanisqatsi means "life in chaos", or, as the film's tag-line indicates, "life out of balance". At the end of this documentary, we understand director Godfrey Reggio wanted to bring on screen the state of confusion and frenzy in which modern society lives in, thus the obscure-sounding word that he chose as the title of the film. But he also wanted to evoke the unbalance and damage we as humans inflict on the natural environment. This mesmerizing documentary does so without a voice-over or without the use of any conventional plot. It is kind of ironic that "Koyaanisqatsi" in portraying both natural landscapes and urban settings creates this mysteriously crafted harmony that is quite the contrary of live's chaotic essence. The massive use of time lapses, slow-motion, and super-impositions, the first two being quite common set-pieces for an average documentary, actually are essential in giving the film an artistically bold spirit very few other films achieved in a similar fashion. Without them, some of the most memorable sequences of the film would be impossible. For the magic to work, music is essential here. Philip Glass' score on "Koyaanisqatsi" is arguably the most acclaimed soundtrack he's ever written: hypnotic, busy and above all beautiful, it's a mixture between jazz, choral, and Classical, played with great subtly and delicacy. The album Glass made, extracted from the work he did on the film, is now a famous soundtrack album that is easily one of the pinnacles of Modern Classical music. An experience like no other, the obscure lyricism of "Koyaanisqatsi" is timeless and awe- inspiring: luckily it is now a cult film, easy to find and to share. Followed by two similar Essay films: "Powaqqatsi" and "Naqoyqatsi".

    Pleasant and haunting at the same time, the powerful combination of music synchronized with visuals and the chant at the beginning makes the film an experience that could well induce a trance in sensitive, intuitive people that can lead to a realization that Time is not linear in an absolute sense, and that the 'experience' of Time is multi dimensional  even leading to an experience of timelessness or Eternity. The film has universal symbolism about the contrast between raw, primordial nature that symbolizes the beginning of time for all practical purposes (creation), and technology that seemingly speeds up time as it approaches the end point of all technology  which is destruction. I am surprised that no one mentions that it symbolizes Time Fractals (concept developed by Terence Kenna- the process of the ever increasing rate of change of events in temporal reality culminating in the Eschaton ) and thereby gives us an inkling of the counter-concept of Time/Temporal Reality - and that is: Eternity ( in which both the concepts of change and static fail to apply). Incidentally, Mckenna developed the Time Fractals concept and the theory from the study of 'I Ching', but also co-related it with the Native American/ Meso-American concept of Circular Time in the process of the cycles of Creation-Destruction. Eternity is not an infinitely long period of linear time, and therefore eternity cannot be conceived by reason, only fleetingly felt or glimpsed in intuitive, synthesis experience. Linear time is conceived by rational thought working on memory, that then extrapolates its generalizations to extend this conceived linearity which is appropriately limited only to one's lifetime and therefore it is a misconception to generalize it beyond the memory, beyond the personal experiences and the History of mankind. This does not mean that linear time is a total misconception. It is only in linear time (can also be called objective time) that the synchronization of all the living, sentient beings of a world and (by extension) of the universe can possibly take place. The point here is that to make a 'leap of logic' to extend the validity of linear time indefinitely to the past and the future is fallacious and misleading. Even logically it is inconceivable that time extends infinitely backwards into the past  it brings up absurdities and paradoxes that cannot be cannot be resolved if we stick to a fixed conception of linear time that can be extended indefinitely into the past or future. One way of resolving this absurdity and paradox is to conceive of time as the rate of change of events taking place in the physical world, rather than stubbornly stick only to the notion of 'objective time as recorded by a clock' (a notion that has been 'hard programmed' into us by the standard science based educational system). Secondly, when we are in a synthesis, intuitive or imaginative mode of experience, these fixed notions of linear time are necessarily suspended for this mode of experience to be of any significance.

    I have seen some good feature length documentary films that have featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and a few good experimental films are included as well, so I was intrigued by this combination of the two genres, from director Godfrey Reggio and executive producer Francis Ford Coppola. The title is a Hopi Indian term for "life out of balance", the film has no dialogue whatsoever, including no voice-over narration, it is simply a visual concert of moving images, including many slowed down and sped up, with music to accompany the footage. The film does not have a traditionally structured plot, but the scenario is definite starting from what essentially the origins of Earth in the large scale deserted and beautiful landscapes moving into the world of industry and civilisation. We see various images throughout that tell the story of the world we live in, including the sight of cloud formations, ocean waves, a rocket being blasted into space, a quarry work site, factories and station, cityscapes and lights going on and off, sunrises and sunsets, people walking through their environments, traffic moving on all types of road, people working, machines producing various goods, convenience environments, leisure environments, and many more man-made elements in everyday life. The key message of the film is ultimately that life is out of balance, full of craziness, in turmoil, in some ways disintegrating and however you look at it there is always something that comes along to change the way to go on living, for good or for bad. The music by composer Phillip Glass is absolutely magnificent, sometimes deliberately repetitive to give the sense of routine in life, and the chanting of the title "Koyaanisqatsi" is intoxicating, the film using juxtaposing natural wonders with sometimes bleak man-made industry is cleverly done, it may ache your eyes slightly with footage speeding and slowing throughout, but overall it is a highly watchable and engaging experimental documentary. Good!

    There are two ways I can think of to review a movie: The first is to simply describe the movie, the second is to futilely try to analyze the movie. Neither of these options seemed to work on this film, but I was reminded of something: During the American tour for My Bloody Valentine's immensely influential album Loveless, the band experimented with their audiences' ability to sustain music played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the tour, "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." This is as good of a review of Koyaanisqatsi as I could think of.

    From the Hopi language, Koyaanisqatsi is a word that roughly translates as "crazy life," or "a life out of balance," or perhaps more appropriately, "a way of life that calls for another way of living." Incidentally, that's exactly what this film shows: no plot or story, just a document of the modern age of man, far out of balance from nature, which calls for human beings to adapt to their own constructs. This film doesn't offer any conventional story with any characters; it's purely an experience built from images and sound, to illicit thought and feeling in the viewers. Both the images and music are beautiful in their own ways: with Phillip Glass' epic, well-structured music score, the film takes on a palpable rhythm and mood that perfectly accentuates the gorgeous scenery. The film plays around a lot with time-lapse footage and slow-motion, which serve to show common cityscapes in an invoking new way. Altogether, the film is as hypnotic and mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking. This film was cobbled together from all kinds of footage filmed across the United States from 1975 to 1983, with a tight budget. Regardless, the filmmakers show superb prowess with their photography and editing skills. At least on a technical level, they've maximized their potential and tools to craft an audio/visual masterpiece, weaving the images and music to the themes implied with the term Koyaanisqatsi. As far as the content goes, like any piece of art, it's left to the viewer's interpretation. The most opaque of themes will revolve around civilization's progress, the depletion of nature, and the effects of technology and industrialization on the human race. There are times in the film where humanity seems triumphant, and other times where it feels like it's spinning out of control in a downward spiral of chaos and destruction (especially in one of the film's final shots, depicting an Atlas-Centaur rocket exploding; it's a sequence that's always hit me the hardest, given the combination of imagery, music, and the overall theme that human civilization rises so high, but will eventually crash and burn). Watching this film is not only a treat for the eyes and ears, but also a sobering, moving experience unlike any other. I believe it truly represents the best and worst of the human race in the modern age, and everybody should see it at least once in a lifetime. 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)

    This strange title hide a movie which critics the world of today, who is evolve constantly but since the human is living on this planet, the pollution is common. "Koyaanisqatsi" is an awesome movie for cinema lover peoples because it contains fabulous images and a wonderful music. This movie make us think about the actions of the human on the environment. After watched this movie, i realize the earth changed a lot since the human use it. But, i think some shots in this movie are a bit slow. Directed by an unknown people with the name of Godfrey Reggio, formerly monk, this movie will stays in my mind and i don't will hesitate to watch it again. A must see movie.

    This should have been ideal for me. I am always on the lookout for transcendent vision, and second to the real journey is only the cinematic ritual. Herzog does it for me, Tarkovsky and his rituals about time inside time. And I firmly believe it has done quite a bit of harm to think the universe is telling some sort of story, it has misled us to devise arcs and expect story-answers, so I welcome any attempt that aspires to push against the boundaries of thought and narrative. That is always the essential ritual, only the tool that allows the dancer to submerge himself beyond thought and description, to where he can be one with dance that means itself. I will not deny the man the powerful dance of his images, or the dedicated craft, but the ending reveals him to be shallow in the reach and depth of his meditation (if you were on the fence before). And it matters that this narrows the world by so much, because a lot of people are coming to it for a worldview and willing to open up. His "life out of balance"(Koyaanisqatsi) is "a state of life that calls for another way of living". It is just small view to contrast natural 'purity' with the evils and violence of man-made technology. Worse, it is every bit as idealized and un-natural as seeking out panoramas of skies for their extraordinariness. You can suspect that the filmmakers had to sift through a lot of unexciting shots of nature until they could settle on images that were nature as they wanted it to be, more 'natural' than others. And passing that as spiritual vision narrows the world, because it forces harmony where actual nature has turbulence built into it, stochastic chaos, and that forces a story of something originally pure and stable -paradise- that we are separate from and uprooting, and this sort of religious thinking only further separates us from the natural world. It also ignores fundamental dynamics of the real thing. For one, "life out of balance" is the natural way, it is why everything exists in the first place; planets are in position, because universal space exploded in that first minute of creation. I wonder if he was blind to it in his own images of swirling clouds and sand-particles. Moreover, we are indeed, doing a lot of destructively rapid , short-sighted terraforming of our own next to nature's, and a lot of our contraptions break, but wouldn't it be much more agreeable to counterpoint that with some of the many wonderful advances we have made on the backs of failure? Being able to separate now poisonous from edible and medicinal plants, means people died in the discovery, brave and curious explorers. And this guy is just not a very curious explorer to me. He has traveled far and captured amazing things on tape. But, it seems as if all has to fit into that one image, instead of one image splintering to reveal a multitude of reflections. His craft reveals as much; it strives for controlled perfection, omniscience, monumental depiction, clean boundaries, in every bit the same way as Riefenstahl fought in her films to choreograph the world into her own image of idealized sensuality - confused for spiritual. It's no wonder Coppola was so smitten by this he put his name and money on it, a similarly over-zealous man enthralled (at one point) by 'mystical' nature. Both, by their overly zealous approach to freeze transcendence, reveal in a roundabout way the limitations of the human model criticized here: we are at odds with this being an imperfect , chaotic world, so when the film ends with footage of burning space rocket debris cascading from the skies, the notion is not acceptance of the inevitable end of things, but a cautionary lament: if only we lived another way, things wouldn't blow up in our face. And there is simply no such way to live, not without skiing on imbalance, which is why life is exciting in the first place. And we all have to live with the fact every single day. The energy world has to daily spend a large amount simply to make-up for turbulent energy loss, because that is nature's way. And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?

    Koyaanisqatsi contains and unreels some of the most breathtaking images ever committed to celluloid. Translated from the Hopi language, the title means 'life out of balance' and attempts - and very successfully - shows all of man's manifestations, usually in startling close-up but also often sped-up, juxtaposed against our own-made surroundings. Since Dziga Vertov's 1928 Russian experimental film "Man with a Movie Camera", a few pioneering directors have attempted to show familiar, and not so familiar surroundings in a new and refreshing way. But none so much as the collaboration here between Godfrey Reggio and contemporary composer Philip Glass. The images are always hypnotic, some unearthly beautiful and when it slowed to its climax, I was so disappointed it had finished. The comparisons between printed circuit boards to conveyor belt manufacturing to highly urbanised street scenes are magical and compulsive. Watch on the biggest screen you can and play the sound through a separate hi-fi or home cinema system. Glass' music follows and resonates with these streams of visuals - one is the other. With executive producers Francis Ford Copolla and George Lucas, both mega directors of their day, this project had some heavyweight backing. Koyaanisqatsi was followed by the not-quite-as-compulsive Powaqqatsi which has a different take on human activity.

    A mesmerizing stream of photography, sans-narration, set to an unforgettable score. Breathtakingly composed, it's like a guided tour of a master photog's personal portfolio, with lingering still shots mingling beautifully with their moving brethren. High-shutter landscape panoramas, silencing animated time-lapses and fast paced long-exposure peeks at civilization effectively capture the wonderful beauty we take for granted every day. A fantastically matched, epic-scale soundtrack by Philip Glass bumps it up yet another level, providing backbone and structure where it's most desperately needed. Midway through the picture, I was surprised to realize that I was thinking more during this sequence of mildly-related compositions than I ever had during a more traditional film. It's a stunner, something I can throw on at any time, in the middle of any chapter, and enjoy without hesitation. Pure beauty that's even more impressive considering its age, it's worth adding to any HD library.

    From the Hopi language, Koyaanisqatsi is a word that roughly translates as "crazy life," or "a life out of balance," or perhaps more appropriately, "a way of life that calls for another way of living." Incidentally, that's exactly what this film shows: no plot or story, just a document of the modern age of man, far out of balance from nature, which calls for human beings to adapt to their own constructs. This film doesn't offer any conventional story with any characters; it's purely an experience built from images and sound, to illicit thought and feeling in the viewers. Both the images and music are beautiful in their own ways: with Phillip Glass' epic, well-structured music score, the film takes on a palpable rhythm and mood that perfectly accentuates the gorgeous scenery. The film plays around a lot with time-lapse footage and slow-motion, which serve to show common cityscapes in an invoking new way. Altogether, the film is as hypnotic and mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking. This film was cobbled together from all kinds of footage filmed across the United States from 1975 to 1983, with a tight budget. Regardless, the filmmakers show superb prowess with their photography and editing skills. At least on a technical level, they've maximized their potential and tools to craft an audio/visual masterpiece, weaving the images and music to the themes implied with the term Koyaanisqatsi. As far as the content goes, like any piece of art, it's left to the viewer's interpretation. The most opaque of themes will revolve around civilization's progress, the depletion of nature, and the effects of technology and industrialization on the human race. There are times in the film where humanity seems triumphant, and other times where it feels like it's spinning out of control in a downward spiral of chaos and destruction (especially in one of the film's final shots, depicting an Atlas-Centaur rocket exploding; it's a sequence that's always hit me the hardest, given the combination of imagery, music, and the overall theme that human civilization rises so high, but will eventually crash and burn). Watching this film is not only a treat for the eyes and ears, but also a sobering, moving experience unlike any other. I believe it truly represents the best and worst of the human race in the modern age, and everybody should see it at least once in a lifetime. 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)

    This strange title hide a movie which critics the world of today, who is evolve constantly but since the human is living on this planet, the pollution is common. "Koyaanisqatsi" is an awesome movie for cinema lover peoples because it contains fabulous images and a wonderful music. This movie make us think about the actions of the human on the environment. After watched this movie, i realize the earth changed a lot since the human use it. But, i think some shots in this movie are a bit slow. Directed by an unknown people with the name of Godfrey Reggio, formerly monk, this movie will stays in my mind and i don't will hesitate to watch it again. A must see movie.

    This should have been ideal for me. I am always on the lookout for transcendent vision, and second to the real journey is only the cinematic ritual. Herzog does it for me, Tarkovsky and his rituals about time inside time. And I firmly believe it has done quite a bit of harm to think the universe is telling some sort of story, it has misled us to devise arcs and expect story-answers, so I welcome any attempt that aspires to push against the boundaries of thought and narrative. That is always the essential ritual, only the tool that allows the dancer to submerge himself beyond thought and description, to where he can be one with dance that means itself. I will not deny the man the powerful dance of his images, or the dedicated craft, but the ending reveals him to be shallow in the reach and depth of his meditation (if you were on the fence before). And it matters that this narrows the world by so much, because a lot of people are coming to it for a worldview and willing to open up. His "life out of balance"(Koyaanisqatsi) is "a state of life that calls for another way of living". It is just small view to contrast natural 'purity' with the evils and violence of man-made technology. Worse, it is every bit as idealized and un-natural as seeking out panoramas of skies for their extraordinariness. You can suspect that the filmmakers had to sift through a lot of unexciting shots of nature until they could settle on images that were nature as they wanted it to be, more 'natural' than others. And passing that as spiritual vision narrows the world, because it forces harmony where actual nature has turbulence built into it, stochastic chaos, and that forces a story of something originally pure and stable -paradise- that we are separate from and uprooting, and this sort of religious thinking only further separates us from the natural world. It also ignores fundamental dynamics of the real thing. For one, "life out of balance" is the natural way, it is why everything exists in the first place; planets are in position, because universal space exploded in that first minute of creation. I wonder if he was blind to it in his own images of swirling clouds and sand-particles. Moreover, we are indeed, doing a lot of destructively rapid , short-sighted terraforming of our own next to nature's, and a lot of our contraptions break, but wouldn't it be much more agreeable to counterpoint that with some of the many wonderful advances we have made on the backs of failure? Being able to separate now poisonous from edible and medicinal plants, means people died in the discovery, brave and curious explorers. And this guy is just not a very curious explorer to me. He has traveled far and captured amazing things on tape. But, it seems as if all has to fit into that one image, instead of one image splintering to reveal a multitude of reflections. His craft reveals as much; it strives for controlled perfection, omniscience, monumental depiction, clean boundaries, in every bit the same way as Riefenstahl fought in her films to choreograph the world into her own image of idealized sensuality - confused for spiritual. It's no wonder Coppola was so smitten by this he put his name and money on it, a similarly over-zealous man enthralled (at one point) by 'mystical' nature. Both, by their overly zealous approach to freeze transcendence, reveal in a roundabout way the limitations of the human model criticized here: we are at odds with this being an imperfect , chaotic world, so when the film ends with footage of burning space rocket debris cascading from the skies, the notion is not acceptance of the inevitable end of things, but a cautionary lament: if only we lived another way, things wouldn't blow up in our face. And there is simply no such way to live, not without skiing on imbalance, which is why life is exciting in the first place. And we all have to live with the fact every single day. The energy world has to daily spend a large amount simply to make-up for turbulent energy loss, because that is nature's way. And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?

    Koyaanisqatsi contains and unreels some of the most breathtaking images ever committed to celluloid. Translated from the Hopi language, the title means 'life out of balance' and attempts - and very successfully - shows all of man's manifestations, usually in startling close-up but also often sped-up, juxtaposed against our own-made surroundings. Since Dziga Vertov's 1928 Russian experimental film "Man with a Movie Camera", a few pioneering directors have attempted to show familiar, and not so familiar surroundings in a new and refreshing way. But none so much as the collaboration here between Godfrey Reggio and contemporary composer Philip Glass. The images are always hypnotic, some unearthly beautiful and when it slowed to its climax, I was so disappointed it had finished. The comparisons between printed circuit boards to conveyor belt manufacturing to highly urbanised street scenes are magical and compulsive. Watch on the biggest screen you can and play the sound through a separate hi-fi or home cinema system. Glass' music follows and resonates with these streams of visuals - one is the other. With executive producers Francis Ford Copolla and George Lucas, both mega directors of their day, this project had some heavyweight backing. Koyaanisqatsi was followed by the not-quite-as-compulsive Powaqqatsi which has a different take on human activity.

    A mesmerizing stream of photography, sans-narration, set to an unforgettable score. Breathtakingly composed, it's like a guided tour of a master photog's personal portfolio, with lingering still shots mingling beautifully with their moving brethren. High-shutter landscape panoramas, silencing animated time-lapses and fast paced long-exposure peeks at civilization effectively capture the wonderful beauty we take for granted every day. A fantastically matched, epic-scale soundtrack by Philip Glass bumps it up yet another level, providing backbone and structure where it's most desperately needed. Midway through the picture, I was surprised to realize that I was thinking more during this sequence of mildly-related compositions than I ever had during a more traditional film. It's a stunner, something I can throw on at any time, in the middle of any chapter, and enjoy without hesitation. Pure beauty that's even more impressive considering its age, it's worth adding to any HD library.

    Videos strung together, coordinated with Phillip Glass' music. Nature (clouds, waves, mountains, shores) is described as beautiful, enduring, good. Humanity is ambushed as ugly, stupid, wasteful, enslaved, impoverished, ant-like, and injurious to the landscape. Cinematography: 5/10 I saw this in the late 1980s, and remember being quite impressed by the visuals. On the Hulu version I saw in 2013, I was not impressed at all. The focus was soft, the colors washed out, the contrast low. Incidental music: 5/10 Beyond irritating. When associated with humans in video, the music had the sort of manic activity one might associate with the Keystone Cops, but with oppressive overtones. Screenplay: 2/10 The point of view is 'nature is great, humanity is the opposite.'

    In the Hopi Language, Koyaanisqatsi means "life in chaos", or, as the film's tag-line indicates, "life out of balance". At the end of this documentary, we understand director Godfrey Reggio wanted to bring on screen the state of confusion and frenzy in which modern society lives in, thus the obscure-sounding word that he chose as the title of the film. But he also wanted to evoke the unbalance and damage we as humans inflict on the natural environment. This mesmerizing documentary does so without a voice-over or without the use of any conventional plot. It is kind of ironic that "Koyaanisqatsi" in portraying both natural landscapes and urban settings creates this mysteriously crafted harmony that is quite the contrary of live's chaotic essence. The massive use of time lapses, slow-motion, and super-impositions, the first two being quite common set-pieces for an average documentary, actually are essential in giving the film an artistically bold spirit very few other films achieved in a similar fashion. Without them, some of the most memorable sequences of the film would be impossible. For the magic to work, music is essential here. Philip Glass' score on "Koyaanisqatsi" is arguably the most acclaimed soundtrack he's ever written: hypnotic, busy and above all beautiful, it's a mixture between jazz, choral, and Classical, played with great subtly and delicacy. The album Glass made, extracted from the work he did on the film, is now a famous soundtrack album that is easily one of the pinnacles of Modern Classical music. An experience like no other, the obscure lyricism of "Koyaanisqatsi" is timeless and awe- inspiring: luckily it is now a cult film, easy to find and to share. Followed by two similar Essay films: "Powaqqatsi" and "Naqoyqatsi".

    Pleasant and haunting at the same time, the powerful combination of music synchronized with visuals and the chant at the beginning makes the film an experience that could well induce a trance in sensitive, intuitive people that can lead to a realization that Time is not linear in an absolute sense, and that the 'experience' of Time is multi dimensional  even leading to an experience of timelessness or Eternity. The film has universal symbolism about the contrast between raw, primordial nature that symbolizes the beginning of time for all practical purposes (creation), and technology that seemingly speeds up time as it approaches the end point of all technology  which is destruction. I am surprised that no one mentions that it symbolizes Time Fractals (concept developed by Terence Kenna- the process of the ever increasing rate of change of events in temporal reality culminating in the Eschaton ) and thereby gives us an inkling of the counter-concept of Time/Temporal Reality - and that is: Eternity ( in which both the concepts of change and static fail to apply). Incidentally, Mckenna developed the Time Fractals concept and the theory from the study of 'I Ching', but also co-related it with the Native American/ Meso-American concept of Circular Time in the process of the cycles of Creation-Destruction. Eternity is not an infinitely long period of linear time, and therefore eternity cannot be conceived by reason, only fleetingly felt or glimpsed in intuitive, synthesis experience. Linear time is conceived by rational thought working on memory, that then extrapolates its generalizations to extend this conceived linearity which is appropriately limited only to one's lifetime and therefore it is a misconception to generalize it beyond the memory, beyond the personal experiences and the History of mankind. This does not mean that linear time is a total misconception. It is only in linear time (can also be called objective time) that the synchronization of all the living, sentient beings of a world and (by extension) of the universe can possibly take place. The point here is that to make a 'leap of logic' to extend the validity of linear time indefinitely to the past and the future is fallacious and misleading. Even logically it is inconceivable that time extends infinitely backwards into the past  it brings up absurdities and paradoxes that cannot be cannot be resolved if we stick to a fixed conception of linear time that can be extended indefinitely into the past or future. One way of resolving this absurdity and paradox is to conceive of time as the rate of change of events taking place in the physical world, rather than stubbornly stick only to the notion of 'objective time as recorded by a clock' (a notion that has been 'hard programmed' into us by the standard science based educational system). Secondly, when we are in a synthesis, intuitive or imaginative mode of experience, these fixed notions of linear time are necessarily suspended for this mode of experience to be of any significance.

    I have seen some good feature length documentary films that have featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and a few good experimental films are included as well, so I was intrigued by this combination of the two genres, from director Godfrey Reggio and executive producer Francis Ford Coppola. The title is a Hopi Indian term for "life out of balance", the film has no dialogue whatsoever, including no voice-over narration, it is simply a visual concert of moving images, including many slowed down and sped up, with music to accompany the footage. The film does not have a traditionally structured plot, but the scenario is definite starting from what essentially the origins of Earth in the large scale deserted and beautiful landscapes moving into the world of industry and civilisation. We see various images throughout that tell the story of the world we live in, including the sight of cloud formations, ocean waves, a rocket being blasted into space, a quarry work site, factories and station, cityscapes and lights going on and off, sunrises and sunsets, people walking through their environments, traffic moving on all types of road, people working, machines producing various goods, convenience environments, leisure environments, and many more man-made elements in everyday life. The key message of the film is ultimately that life is out of balance, full of craziness, in turmoil, in some ways disintegrating and however you look at it there is always something that comes along to change the way to go on living, for good or for bad. The music by composer Phillip Glass is absolutely magnificent, sometimes deliberately repetitive to give the sense of routine in life, and the chanting of the title "Koyaanisqatsi" is intoxicating, the film using juxtaposing natural wonders with sometimes bleak man-made industry is cleverly done, it may ache your eyes slightly with footage speeding and slowing throughout, but overall it is a highly watchable and engaging experimental documentary. Good!

    There are two ways I can think of to review a movie: The first is to simply describe the movie, the second is to futilely try to analyze the movie. Neither of these options seemed to work on this film, but I was reminded of something: During the American tour for My Bloody Valentine's immensely influential album Loveless, the band experimented with their audiences' ability to sustain music played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the tour, "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." This is as good of a review of Koyaanisqatsi as I could think of.

    In the Hopi Language, Koyaanisqatsi means "life in chaos", or, as the film's tag-line indicates, "life out of balance". At the end of this documentary, we understand director Godfrey Reggio wanted to bring on screen the state of confusion and frenzy in which modern society lives in, thus the obscure-sounding word that he chose as the title of the film. But he also wanted to evoke the unbalance and damage we as humans inflict on the natural environment. This mesmerizing documentary does so without a voice-over or without the use of any conventional plot. It is kind of ironic that "Koyaanisqatsi" in portraying both natural landscapes and urban settings creates this mysteriously crafted harmony that is quite the contrary of live's chaotic essence. The massive use of time lapses, slow-motion, and super-impositions, the first two being quite common set-pieces for an average documentary, actually are essential in giving the film an artistically bold spirit very few other films achieved in a similar fashion. Without them, some of the most memorable sequences of the film would be impossible. For the magic to work, music is essential here. Philip Glass' score on "Koyaanisqatsi" is arguably the most acclaimed soundtrack he's ever written: hypnotic, busy and above all beautiful, it's a mixture between jazz, choral, and Classical, played with great subtly and delicacy. The album Glass made, extracted from the work he did on the film, is now a famous soundtrack album that is easily one of the pinnacles of Modern Classical music. An experience like no other, the obscure lyricism of "Koyaanisqatsi" is timeless and awe- inspiring: luckily it is now a cult film, easy to find and to share. Followed by two similar Essay films: "Powaqqatsi" and "Naqoyqatsi".

    Pleasant and haunting at the same time, the powerful combination of music synchronized with visuals and the chant at the beginning makes the film an experience that could well induce a trance in sensitive, intuitive people that can lead to a realization that Time is not linear in an absolute sense, and that the 'experience' of Time is multi dimensional  even leading to an experience of timelessness or Eternity. The film has universal symbolism about the contrast between raw, primordial nature that symbolizes the beginning of time for all practical purposes (creation), and technology that seemingly speeds up time as it approaches the end point of all technology  which is destruction. I am surprised that no one mentions that it symbolizes Time Fractals (concept developed by Terence Kenna- the process of the ever increasing rate of change of events in temporal reality culminating in the Eschaton ) and thereby gives us an inkling of the counter-concept of Time/Temporal Reality - and that is: Eternity ( in which both the concepts of change and static fail to apply). Incidentally, Mckenna developed the Time Fractals concept and the theory from the study of 'I Ching', but also co-related it with the Native American/ Meso-American concept of Circular Time in the process of the cycles of Creation-Destruction. Eternity is not an infinitely long period of linear time, and therefore eternity cannot be conceived by reason, only fleetingly felt or glimpsed in intuitive, synthesis experience. Linear time is conceived by rational thought working on memory, that then extrapolates its generalizations to extend this conceived linearity which is appropriately limited only to one's lifetime and therefore it is a misconception to generalize it beyond the memory, beyond the personal experiences and the History of mankind. This does not mean that linear time is a total misconception. It is only in linear time (can also be called objective time) that the synchronization of all the living, sentient beings of a world and (by extension) of the universe can possibly take place. The point here is that to make a 'leap of logic' to extend the validity of linear time indefinitely to the past and the future is fallacious and misleading. Even logically it is inconceivable that time extends infinitely backwards into the past  it brings up absurdities and paradoxes that cannot be cannot be resolved if we stick to a fixed conception of linear time that can be extended indefinitely into the past or future. One way of resolving this absurdity and paradox is to conceive of time as the rate of change of events taking place in the physical world, rather than stubbornly stick only to the notion of 'objective time as recorded by a clock' (a notion that has been 'hard programmed' into us by the standard science based educational system). Secondly, when we are in a synthesis, intuitive or imaginative mode of experience, these fixed notions of linear time are necessarily suspended for this mode of experience to be of any significance.

    I have seen some good feature length documentary films that have featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and a few good experimental films are included as well, so I was intrigued by this combination of the two genres, from director Godfrey Reggio and executive producer Francis Ford Coppola. The title is a Hopi Indian term for "life out of balance", the film has no dialogue whatsoever, including no voice-over narration, it is simply a visual concert of moving images, including many slowed down and sped up, with music to accompany the footage. The film does not have a traditionally structured plot, but the scenario is definite starting from what essentially the origins of Earth in the large scale deserted and beautiful landscapes moving into the world of industry and civilisation. We see various images throughout that tell the story of the world we live in, including the sight of cloud formations, ocean waves, a rocket being blasted into space, a quarry work site, factories and station, cityscapes and lights going on and off, sunrises and sunsets, people walking through their environments, traffic moving on all types of road, people working, machines producing various goods, convenience environments, leisure environments, and many more man-made elements in everyday life. The key message of the film is ultimately that life is out of balance, full of craziness, in turmoil, in some ways disintegrating and however you look at it there is always something that comes along to change the way to go on living, for good or for bad. The music by composer Phillip Glass is absolutely magnificent, sometimes deliberately repetitive to give the sense of routine in life, and the chanting of the title "Koyaanisqatsi" is intoxicating, the film using juxtaposing natural wonders with sometimes bleak man-made industry is cleverly done, it may ache your eyes slightly with footage speeding and slowing throughout, but overall it is a highly watchable and engaging experimental documentary. Good!

    There are two ways I can think of to review a movie: The first is to simply describe the movie, the second is to futilely try to analyze the movie. Neither of these options seemed to work on this film, but I was reminded of something: During the American tour for My Bloody Valentine's immensely influential album Loveless, the band experimented with their audiences' ability to sustain music played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the tour, "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." This is as good of a review of Koyaanisqatsi as I could think of.

    From the Hopi language, Koyaanisqatsi is a word that roughly translates as "crazy life," or "a life out of balance," or perhaps more appropriately, "a way of life that calls for another way of living." Incidentally, that's exactly what this film shows: no plot or story, just a document of the modern age of man, far out of balance from nature, which calls for human beings to adapt to their own constructs. This film doesn't offer any conventional story with any characters; it's purely an experience built from images and sound, to illicit thought and feeling in the viewers. Both the images and music are beautiful in their own ways: with Phillip Glass' epic, well-structured music score, the film takes on a palpable rhythm and mood that perfectly accentuates the gorgeous scenery. The film plays around a lot with time-lapse footage and slow-motion, which serve to show common cityscapes in an invoking new way. Altogether, the film is as hypnotic and mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking. This film was cobbled together from all kinds of footage filmed across the United States from 1975 to 1983, with a tight budget. Regardless, the filmmakers show superb prowess with their photography and editing skills. At least on a technical level, they've maximized their potential and tools to craft an audio/visual masterpiece, weaving the images and music to the themes implied with the term Koyaanisqatsi. As far as the content goes, like any piece of art, it's left to the viewer's interpretation. The most opaque of themes will revolve around civilization's progress, the depletion of nature, and the effects of technology and industrialization on the human race. There are times in the film where humanity seems triumphant, and other times where it feels like it's spinning out of control in a downward spiral of chaos and destruction (especially in one of the film's final shots, depicting an Atlas-Centaur rocket exploding; it's a sequence that's always hit me the hardest, given the combination of imagery, music, and the overall theme that human civilization rises so high, but will eventually crash and burn). Watching this film is not only a treat for the eyes and ears, but also a sobering, moving experience unlike any other. I believe it truly represents the best and worst of the human race in the modern age, and everybody should see it at least once in a lifetime. 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)

    This strange title hide a movie which critics the world of today, who is evolve constantly but since the human is living on this planet, the pollution is common. "Koyaanisqatsi" is an awesome movie for cinema lover peoples because it contains fabulous images and a wonderful music. This movie make us think about the actions of the human on the environment. After watched this movie, i realize the earth changed a lot since the human use it. But, i think some shots in this movie are a bit slow. Directed by an unknown people with the name of Godfrey Reggio, formerly monk, this movie will stays in my mind and i don't will hesitate to watch it again. A must see movie.

    This should have been ideal for me. I am always on the lookout for transcendent vision, and second to the real journey is only the cinematic ritual. Herzog does it for me, Tarkovsky and his rituals about time inside time. And I firmly believe it has done quite a bit of harm to think the universe is telling some sort of story, it has misled us to devise arcs and expect story-answers, so I welcome any attempt that aspires to push against the boundaries of thought and narrative. That is always the essential ritual, only the tool that allows the dancer to submerge himself beyond thought and description, to where he can be one with dance that means itself. I will not deny the man the powerful dance of his images, or the dedicated craft, but the ending reveals him to be shallow in the reach and depth of his meditation (if you were on the fence before). And it matters that this narrows the world by so much, because a lot of people are coming to it for a worldview and willing to open up. His "life out of balance"(Koyaanisqatsi) is "a state of life that calls for another way of living". It is just small view to contrast natural 'purity' with the evils and violence of man-made technology. Worse, it is every bit as idealized and un-natural as seeking out panoramas of skies for their extraordinariness. You can suspect that the filmmakers had to sift through a lot of unexciting shots of nature until they could settle on images that were nature as they wanted it to be, more 'natural' than others. And passing that as spiritual vision narrows the world, because it forces harmony where actual nature has turbulence built into it, stochastic chaos, and that forces a story of something originally pure and stable -paradise- that we are separate from and uprooting, and this sort of religious thinking only further separates us from the natural world. It also ignores fundamental dynamics of the real thing. For one, "life out of balance" is the natural way, it is why everything exists in the first place; planets are in position, because universal space exploded in that first minute of creation. I wonder if he was blind to it in his own images of swirling clouds and sand-particles. Moreover, we are indeed, doing a lot of destructively rapid , short-sighted terraforming of our own next to nature's, and a lot of our contraptions break, but wouldn't it be much more agreeable to counterpoint that with some of the many wonderful advances we have made on the backs of failure? Being able to separate now poisonous from edible and medicinal plants, means people died in the discovery, brave and curious explorers. And this guy is just not a very curious explorer to me. He has traveled far and captured amazing things on tape. But, it seems as if all has to fit into that one image, instead of one image splintering to reveal a multitude of reflections. His craft reveals as much; it strives for controlled perfection, omniscience, monumental depiction, clean boundaries, in every bit the same way as Riefenstahl fought in her films to choreograph the world into her own image of idealized sensuality - confused for spiritual. It's no wonder Coppola was so smitten by this he put his name and money on it, a similarly over-zealous man enthralled (at one point) by 'mystical' nature. Both, by their overly zealous approach to freeze transcendence, reveal in a roundabout way the limitations of the human model criticized here: we are at odds with this being an imperfect , chaotic world, so when the film ends with footage of burning space rocket debris cascading from the skies, the notion is not acceptance of the inevitable end of things, but a cautionary lament: if only we lived another way, things wouldn't blow up in our face. And there is simply no such way to live, not without skiing on imbalance, which is why life is exciting in the first place. And we all have to live with the fact every single day. The energy world has to daily spend a large amount simply to make-up for turbulent energy loss, because that is nature's way. And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?

    Koyaanisqatsi contains and unreels some of the most breathtaking images ever committed to celluloid. Translated from the Hopi language, the title means 'life out of balance' and attempts - and very successfully - shows all of man's manifestations, usually in startling close-up but also often sped-up, juxtaposed against our own-made surroundings. Since Dziga Vertov's 1928 Russian experimental film "Man with a Movie Camera", a few pioneering directors have attempted to show familiar, and not so familiar surroundings in a new and refreshing way. But none so much as the collaboration here between Godfrey Reggio and contemporary composer Philip Glass. The images are always hypnotic, some unearthly beautiful and when it slowed to its climax, I was so disappointed it had finished. The comparisons between printed circuit boards to conveyor belt manufacturing to highly urbanised street scenes are magical and compulsive. Watch on the biggest screen you can and play the sound through a separate hi-fi or home cinema system. Glass' music follows and resonates with these streams of visuals - one is the other. With executive producers Francis Ford Copolla and George Lucas, both mega directors of their day, this project had some heavyweight backing. Koyaanisqatsi was followed by the not-quite-as-compulsive Powaqqatsi which has a different take on human activity.

    A mesmerizing stream of photography, sans-narration, set to an unforgettable score. Breathtakingly composed, it's like a guided tour of a master photog's personal portfolio, with lingering still shots mingling beautifully with their moving brethren. High-shutter landscape panoramas, silencing animated time-lapses and fast paced long-exposure peeks at civilization effectively capture the wonderful beauty we take for granted every day. A fantastically matched, epic-scale soundtrack by Philip Glass bumps it up yet another level, providing backbone and structure where it's most desperately needed. Midway through the picture, I was surprised to realize that I was thinking more during this sequence of mildly-related compositions than I ever had during a more traditional film. It's a stunner, something I can throw on at any time, in the middle of any chapter, and enjoy without hesitation. Pure beauty that's even more impressive considering its age, it's worth adding to any HD library.

    Videos strung together, coordinated with Phillip Glass' music. Nature (clouds, waves, mountains, shores) is described as beautiful, enduring, good. Humanity is ambushed as ugly, stupid, wasteful, enslaved, impoverished, ant-like, and injurious to the landscape. Cinematography: 5/10 I saw this in the late 1980s, and remember being quite impressed by the visuals. On the Hulu version I saw in 2013, I was not impressed at all. The focus was soft, the colors washed out, the contrast low. Incidental music: 5/10 Beyond irritating. When associated with humans in video, the music had the sort of manic activity one might associate with the Keystone Cops, but with oppressive overtones. Screenplay: 2/10 The point of view is 'nature is great, humanity is the opposite.'

That is always the essential ritual, only the tool that allows the dancer to submerge himself beyond thought and description, to where he can be one with dance that means itself. I will not deny the man the powerful dance of his images, or the dedicated craft, but the ending reveals him to be shallow in the reach and depth of his meditation (if you were on the fence before). And it matters that this narrows the world by so much, because a lot of people are coming to it for a worldview and willing to open up. His "life out of balance"(Koyaanisqatsi) is "a state of life that calls for another way of living". It is just small view to contrast natural 'purity' with the evils and violence of man-made technology. Worse, it is every bit as idealized and un-natural as seeking out panoramas of skies for their extraordinariness. You can suspect that the filmmakers had to sift through a lot of unexciting shots of nature until they could settle on images that were nature as they wanted it to be, more 'natural' than others. And passing that as spiritual vision narrows the world, because it forces harmony where actual nature has turbulence built into it, stochastic chaos, and that forces a story of something originally pure and stable -paradise- that we are separate from and uprooting, and this sort of religious thinking only further separates us from the natural world. It also ignores fundamental dynamics of the real thing. For one, "life out of balance" is the natural way, it is why everything exists in the first place; planets are in position, because universal space exploded in that first minute of creation. I wonder if he was blind to it in his own images of swirling clouds and sand-particles. Moreover, we are indeed, doing a lot of destructively rapid , short-sighted terraforming of our own next to nature's, and a lot of our contraptions break, but wouldn't it be much more agreeable to counterpoint that with some of the many wonderful advances we have made on the backs of failure? Being able to separate now poisonous from edible and medicinal plants, means people died in the discovery, brave and curious explorers. And this guy is just not a very curious explorer to me. He has traveled far and captured amazing things on tape. But, it seems as if all has to fit into that one image, instead of one image splintering to reveal a multitude of reflections. His craft reveals as much; it strives for controlled perfection, omniscience, monumental depiction, clean boundaries, in every bit the same way as Riefenstahl fought in her films to choreograph the world into her own image of idealized sensuality - confused for spiritual. It's no wonder Coppola was so smitten by this he put his name and money on it, a similarly over-zealous man enthralled (at one point) by 'mystical' nature. Both, by their overly zealous approach to freeze transcendence, reveal in a roundabout way the limitations of the human model criticized here: we are at odds with this being an imperfect , chaotic world, so when the film ends with footage of burning space rocket debris cascading from the skies, the notion is not acceptance of the inevitable end of things, but a cautionary lament: if only we lived another way, things wouldn't blow up in our face. And there is simply no such way to live, not without skiing on imbalance, which is why life is exciting in the first place. And we all have to live with the fact every single day. The energy world has to daily spend a large amount simply to make-up for turbulent energy loss, because that is nature's way. And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?

    Koyaanisqatsi contains and unreels some of the most breathtaking images ever committed to celluloid. Translated from the Hopi language, the title means 'life out of balance' and attempts - and very successfully - shows all of man's manifestations, usually in startling close-up but also often sped-up, juxtaposed against our own-made surroundings. Since Dziga Vertov's 1928 Russian experimental film "Man with a Movie Camera", a few pioneering directors have attempted to show familiar, and not so familiar surroundings in a new and refreshing way. But none so much as the collaboration here between Godfrey Reggio and contemporary composer Philip Glass. The images are always hypnotic, some unearthly beautiful and when it slowed to its climax, I was so disappointed it had finished. The comparisons between printed circuit boards to conveyor belt manufacturing to highly urbanised street scenes are magical and compulsive. Watch on the biggest screen you can and play the sound through a separate hi-fi or home cinema system. Glass' music follows and resonates with these streams of visuals - one is the other. With executive producers Francis Ford Copolla and George Lucas, both mega directors of their day, this project had some heavyweight backing. Koyaanisqatsi was followed by the not-quite-as-compulsive Powaqqatsi which has a different take on human activity.

    A mesmerizing stream of photography, sans-narration, set to an unforgettable score. Breathtakingly composed, it's like a guided tour of a master photog's personal portfolio, with lingering still shots mingling beautifully with their moving brethren. High-shutter landscape panoramas, silencing animated time-lapses and fast paced long-exposure peeks at civilization effectively capture the wonderful beauty we take for granted every day. A fantastically matched, epic-scale soundtrack by Philip Glass bumps it up yet another level, providing backbone and structure where it's most desperately needed. Midway through the picture, I was surprised to realize that I was thinking more during this sequence of mildly-related compositions than I ever had during a more traditional film. It's a stunner, something I can throw on at any time, in the middle of any chapter, and enjoy without hesitation. Pure beauty that's even more impressive considering its age, it's worth adding to any HD library.

    Videos strung together, coordinated with Phillip Glass' music. Nature (clouds, waves, mountains, shores) is described as beautiful, enduring, good. Humanity is ambushed as ugly, stupid, wasteful, enslaved, impoverished, ant-like, and injurious to the landscape. Cinematography: 5/10 I saw this in the late 1980s, and remember being quite impressed by the visuals. On the Hulu version I saw in 2013, I was not impressed at all. The focus was soft, the colors washed out, the contrast low. Incidental music: 5/10 Beyond irritating. When associated with humans in video, the music had the sort of manic activity one might associate with the Keystone Cops, but with oppressive overtones. Screenplay: 2/10 The point of view is 'nature is great, humanity is the opposite.'

    In the Hopi Language, Koyaanisqatsi means "life in chaos", or, as the film's tag-line indicates, "life out of balance". At the end of this documentary, we understand director Godfrey Reggio wanted to bring on screen the state of confusion and frenzy in which modern society lives in, thus the obscure-sounding word that he chose as the title of the film. But he also wanted to evoke the unbalance and damage we as humans inflict on the natural environment. This mesmerizing documentary does so without a voice-over or without the use of any conventional plot. It is kind of ironic that "Koyaanisqatsi" in portraying both natural landscapes and urban settings creates this mysteriously crafted harmony that is quite the contrary of live's chaotic essence. The massive use of time lapses, slow-motion, and super-impositions, the first two being quite common set-pieces for an average documentary, actually are essential in giving the film an artistically bold spirit very few other films achieved in a similar fashion. Without them, some of the most memorable sequences of the film would be impossible. For the magic to work, music is essential here. Philip Glass' score on "Koyaanisqatsi" is arguably the most acclaimed soundtrack he's ever written: hypnotic, busy and above all beautiful, it's a mixture between jazz, choral, and Classical, played with great subtly and delicacy. The album Glass made, extracted from the work he did on the film, is now a famous soundtrack album that is easily one of the pinnacles of Modern Classical music. An experience like no other, the obscure lyricism of "Koyaanisqatsi" is timeless and awe- inspiring: luckily it is now a cult film, easy to find and to share. Followed by two similar Essay films: "Powaqqatsi" and "Naqoyqatsi".

    Pleasant and haunting at the same time, the powerful combination of music synchronized with visuals and the chant at the beginning makes the film an experience that could well induce a trance in sensitive, intuitive people that can lead to a realization that Time is not linear in an absolute sense, and that the 'experience' of Time is multi dimensional  even leading to an experience of timelessness or Eternity. The film has universal symbolism about the contrast between raw, primordial nature that symbolizes the beginning of time for all practical purposes (creation), and technology that seemingly speeds up time as it approaches the end point of all technology  which is destruction. I am surprised that no one mentions that it symbolizes Time Fractals (concept developed by Terence Kenna- the process of the ever increasing rate of change of events in temporal reality culminating in the Eschaton ) and thereby gives us an inkling of the counter-concept of Time/Temporal Reality - and that is: Eternity ( in which both the concepts of change and static fail to apply). Incidentally, Mckenna developed the Time Fractals concept and the theory from the study of 'I Ching', but also co-related it with the Native American/ Meso-American concept of Circular Time in the process of the cycles of Creation-Destruction. Eternity is not an infinitely long period of linear time, and therefore eternity cannot be conceived by reason, only fleetingly felt or glimpsed in intuitive, synthesis experience. Linear time is conceived by rational thought working on memory, that then extrapolates its generalizations to extend this conceived linearity which is appropriately limited only to one's lifetime and therefore it is a misconception to generalize it beyond the memory, beyond the personal experiences and the History of mankind. This does not mean that linear time is a total misconception. It is only in linear time (can also be called objective time) that the synchronization of all the living, sentient beings of a world and (by extension) of the universe can possibly take place. The point here is that to make a 'leap of logic' to extend the validity of linear time indefinitely to the past and the future is fallacious and misleading. Even logically it is inconceivable that time extends infinitely backwards into the past  it brings up absurdities and paradoxes that cannot be cannot be resolved if we stick to a fixed conception of linear time that can be extended indefinitely into the past or future. One way of resolving this absurdity and paradox is to conceive of time as the rate of change of events taking place in the physical world, rather than stubbornly stick only to the notion of 'objective time as recorded by a clock' (a notion that has been 'hard programmed' into us by the standard science based educational system). Secondly, when we are in a synthesis, intuitive or imaginative mode of experience, these fixed notions of linear time are necessarily suspended for this mode of experience to be of any significance.

    I have seen some good feature length documentary films that have featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and a few good experimental films are included as well, so I was intrigued by this combination of the two genres, from director Godfrey Reggio and executive producer Francis Ford Coppola. The title is a Hopi Indian term for "life out of balance", the film has no dialogue whatsoever, including no voice-over narration, it is simply a visual concert of moving images, including many slowed down and sped up, with music to accompany the footage. The film does not have a traditionally structured plot, but the scenario is definite starting from what essentially the origins of Earth in the large scale deserted and beautiful landscapes moving into the world of industry and civilisation. We see various images throughout that tell the story of the world we live in, including the sight of cloud formations, ocean waves, a rocket being blasted into space, a quarry work site, factories and station, cityscapes and lights going on and off, sunrises and sunsets, people walking through their environments, traffic moving on all types of road, people working, machines producing various goods, convenience environments, leisure environments, and many more man-made elements in everyday life. The key message of the film is ultimately that life is out of balance, full of craziness, in turmoil, in some ways disintegrating and however you look at it there is always something that comes along to change the way to go on living, for good or for bad. The music by composer Phillip Glass is absolutely magnificent, sometimes deliberately repetitive to give the sense of routine in life, and the chanting of the title "Koyaanisqatsi" is intoxicating, the film using juxtaposing natural wonders with sometimes bleak man-made industry is cleverly done, it may ache your eyes slightly with footage speeding and slowing throughout, but overall it is a highly watchable and engaging experimental documentary. Good!

    There are two ways I can think of to review a movie: The first is to simply describe the movie, the second is to futilely try to analyze the movie. Neither of these options seemed to work on this film, but I was reminded of something: During the American tour for My Bloody Valentine's immensely influential album Loveless, the band experimented with their audiences' ability to sustain music played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the tour, "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." This is as good of a review of Koyaanisqatsi as I could think of.

    From the Hopi language, Koyaanisqatsi is a word that roughly translates as "crazy life," or "a life out of balance," or perhaps more appropriately, "a way of life that calls for another way of living." Incidentally, that's exactly what this film shows: no plot or story, just a document of the modern age of man, far out of balance from nature, which calls for human beings to adapt to their own constructs. This film doesn't offer any conventional story with any characters; it's purely an experience built from images and sound, to illicit thought and feeling in the viewers. Both the images and music are beautiful in their own ways: with Phillip Glass' epic, well-structured music score, the film takes on a palpable rhythm and mood that perfectly accentuates the gorgeous scenery. The film plays around a lot with time-lapse footage and slow-motion, which serve to show common cityscapes in an invoking new way. Altogether, the film is as hypnotic and mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking. This film was cobbled together from all kinds of footage filmed across the United States from 1975 to 1983, with a tight budget. Regardless, the filmmakers show superb prowess with their photography and editing skills. At least on a technical level, they've maximized their potential and tools to craft an audio/visual masterpiece, weaving the images and music to the themes implied with the term Koyaanisqatsi. As far as the content goes, like any piece of art, it's left to the viewer's interpretation. The most opaque of themes will revolve around civilization's progress, the depletion of nature, and the effects of technology and industrialization on the human race. There are times in the film where humanity seems triumphant, and other times where it feels like it's spinning out of control in a downward spiral of chaos and destruction (especially in one of the film's final shots, depicting an Atlas-Centaur rocket exploding; it's a sequence that's always hit me the hardest, given the combination of imagery, music, and the overall theme that human civilization rises so high, but will eventually crash and burn). Watching this film is not only a treat for the eyes and ears, but also a sobering, moving experience unlike any other. I believe it truly represents the best and worst of the human race in the modern age, and everybody should see it at least once in a lifetime. 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)

    This strange title hide a movie which critics the world of today, who is evolve constantly but since the human is living on this planet, the pollution is common. "Koyaanisqatsi" is an awesome movie for cinema lover peoples because it contains fabulous images and a wonderful music. This movie make us think about the actions of the human on the environment. After watched this movie, i realize the earth changed a lot since the human use it. But, i think some shots in this movie are a bit slow. Directed by an unknown people with the name of Godfrey Reggio, formerly monk, this movie will stays in my mind and i don't will hesitate to watch it again. A must see movie.

    This should have been ideal for me. I am always on the lookout for transcendent vision, and second to the real journey is only the cinematic ritual. Herzog does it for me, Tarkovsky and his rituals about time inside time. And I firmly believe it has done quite a bit of harm to think the universe is telling some sort of story, it has misled us to devise arcs and expect story-answers, so I welcome any attempt that aspires to push against the boundaries of thought and narrative. That is always the essential ritual, only the tool that allows the dancer to submerge himself beyond thought and description, to where he can be one with dance that means itself. I will not deny the man the powerful dance of his images, or the dedicated craft, but the ending reveals him to be shallow in the reach and depth of his meditation (if you were on the fence before). And it matters that this narrows the world by so much, because a lot of people are coming to it for a worldview and willing to open up.

And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?

Even logically it is inconceivable that time extends infinitely backwards into the past  it brings up absurdities and paradoxes that cannot be cannot be resolved if we stick to a fixed conception of linear time that can be extended indefinitely into the past or future. One way of resolving this absurdity and paradox is to conceive of time as the rate of change of events taking place in the physical world, rather than stubbornly stick only to the notion of 'objective time as recorded by a clock' (a notion that has been 'hard programmed' into us by the standard science based educational system). Secondly, when we are in a synthesis, intuitive or imaginative mode of experience, these fixed notions of linear time are necessarily suspended for this mode of experience to be of any significance.

    I have seen some good feature length documentary films that have featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and a few good experimental films are included as well, so I was intrigued by this combination of the two genres, from director Godfrey Reggio and executive producer Francis Ford Coppola. The title is a Hopi Indian term for "life out of balance", the film has no dialogue whatsoever, including no voice-over narration, it is simply a visual concert of moving images, including many slowed down and sped up, with music to accompany the footage. The film does not have a traditionally structured plot, but the scenario is definite starting from what essentially the origins of Earth in the large scale deserted and beautiful landscapes moving into the world of industry and civilisation. We see various images throughout that tell the story of the world we live in, including the sight of cloud formations, ocean waves, a rocket being blasted into space, a quarry work site, factories and station, cityscapes and lights going on and off, sunrises and sunsets, people walking through their environments, traffic moving on all types of road, people working, machines producing various goods, convenience environments, leisure environments, and many more man-made elements in everyday life. The key message of the film is ultimately that life is out of balance, full of craziness, in turmoil, in some ways disintegrating and however you look at it there is always something that comes along to change the way to go on living, for good or for bad. The music by composer Phillip Glass is absolutely magnificent, sometimes deliberately repetitive to give the sense of routine in life, and the chanting of the title "Koyaanisqatsi" is intoxicating, the film using juxtaposing natural wonders with sometimes bleak man-made industry is cleverly done, it may ache your eyes slightly with footage speeding and slowing throughout, but overall it is a highly watchable and engaging experimental documentary. Good!

    There are two ways I can think of to review a movie: The first is to simply describe the movie, the second is to futilely try to analyze the movie. Neither of these options seemed to work on this film, but I was reminded of something: During the American tour for My Bloody Valentine's immensely influential album Loveless, the band experimented with their audiences' ability to sustain music played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the tour, "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." This is as good of a review of Koyaanisqatsi as I could think of.

    From the Hopi language, Koyaanisqatsi is a word that roughly translates as "crazy life," or "a life out of balance," or perhaps more appropriately, "a way of life that calls for another way of living." Incidentally, that's exactly what this film shows: no plot or story, just a document of the modern age of man, far out of balance from nature, which calls for human beings to adapt to their own constructs. This film doesn't offer any conventional story with any characters; it's purely an experience built from images and sound, to illicit thought and feeling in the viewers. Both the images and music are beautiful in their own ways: with Phillip Glass' epic, well-structured music score, the film takes on a palpable rhythm and mood that perfectly accentuates the gorgeous scenery. The film plays around a lot with time-lapse footage and slow-motion, which serve to show common cityscapes in an invoking new way. Altogether, the film is as hypnotic and mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking. This film was cobbled together from all kinds of footage filmed across the United States from 1975 to 1983, with a tight budget. Regardless, the filmmakers show superb prowess with their photography and editing skills. At least on a technical level, they've maximized their potential and tools to craft an audio/visual masterpiece, weaving the images and music to the themes implied with the term Koyaanisqatsi. As far as the content goes, like any piece of art, it's left to the viewer's interpretation. The most opaque of themes will revolve around civilization's progress, the depletion of nature, and the effects of technology and industrialization on the human race. There are times in the film where humanity seems triumphant, and other times where it feels like it's spinning out of control in a downward spiral of chaos and destruction (especially in one of the film's final shots, depicting an Atlas-Centaur rocket exploding; it's a sequence that's always hit me the hardest, given the combination of imagery, music, and the overall theme that human civilization rises so high, but will eventually crash and burn). Watching this film is not only a treat for the eyes and ears, but also a sobering, moving experience unlike any other. I believe it truly represents the best and worst of the human race in the modern age, and everybody should see it at least once in a lifetime. 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)

    This strange title hide a movie which critics the world of today, who is evolve constantly but since the human is living on this planet, the pollution is common. "Koyaanisqatsi" is an awesome movie for cinema lover peoples because it contains fabulous images and a wonderful music. This movie make us think about the actions of the human on the environment. After watched this movie, i realize the earth changed a lot since the human use it. But, i think some shots in this movie are a bit slow. Directed by an unknown people with the name of Godfrey Reggio, formerly monk, this movie will stays in my mind and i don't will hesitate to watch it again. A must see movie.

    This should have been ideal for me. I am always on the lookout for transcendent vision, and second to the real journey is only the cinematic ritual. Herzog does it for me, Tarkovsky and his rituals about time inside time. And I firmly believe it has done quite a bit of harm to think the universe is telling some sort of story, it has misled us to devise arcs and expect story-answers, so I welcome any attempt that aspires to push against the boundaries of thought and narrative. That is always the essential ritual, only the tool that allows the dancer to submerge himself beyond thought and description, to where he can be one with dance that means itself. I will not deny the man the powerful dance of his images, or the dedicated craft, but the ending reveals him to be shallow in the reach and depth of his meditation (if you were on the fence before). And it matters that this narrows the world by so much, because a lot of people are coming to it for a worldview and willing to open up. His "life out of balance"(Koyaanisqatsi) is "a state of life that calls for another way of living". It is just small view to contrast natural 'purity' with the evils and violence of man-made technology. Worse, it is every bit as idealized and un-natural as seeking out panoramas of skies for their extraordinariness. You can suspect that the filmmakers had to sift through a lot of unexciting shots of nature until they could settle on images that were nature as they wanted it to be, more 'natural' than others. And passing that as spiritual vision narrows the world, because it forces harmony where actual nature has turbulence built into it, stochastic chaos, and that forces a story of something originally pure and stable -paradise- that we are separate from and uprooting, and this sort of religious thinking only further separates us from the natural world. It also ignores fundamental dynamics of the real thing. For one, "life out of balance" is the natural way, it is why everything exists in the first place; planets are in position, because universal space exploded in that first minute of creation. I wonder if he was blind to it in his own images of swirling clouds and sand-particles. Moreover, we are indeed, doing a lot of destructively rapid , short-sighted terraforming of our own next to nature's, and a lot of our contraptions break, but wouldn't it be much more agreeable to counterpoint that with some of the many wonderful advances we have made on the backs of failure? Being able to separate now poisonous from edible and medicinal plants, means people died in the discovery, brave and curious explorers. And this guy is just not a very curious explorer to me. He has traveled far and captured amazing things on tape. But, it seems as if all has to fit into that one image, instead of one image splintering to reveal a multitude of reflections. His craft reveals as much; it strives for controlled perfection, omniscience, monumental depiction, clean boundaries, in every bit the same way as Riefenstahl fought in her films to choreograph the world into her own image of idealized sensuality - confused for spiritual. It's no wonder Coppola was so smitten by this he put his name and money on it, a similarly over-zealous man enthralled (at one point) by 'mystical' nature. Both, by their overly zealous approach to freeze transcendence, reveal in a roundabout way the limitations of the human model criticized here: we are at odds with this being an imperfect , chaotic world, so when the film ends with footage of burning space rocket debris cascading from the skies, the notion is not acceptance of the inevitable end of things, but a cautionary lament: if only we lived another way, things wouldn't blow up in our face. And there is simply no such way to live, not without skiing on imbalance, which is why life is exciting in the first place. And we all have to live with the fact every single day. The energy world has to daily spend a large amount simply to make-up for turbulent energy loss, because that is nature's way. And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?

    Koyaanisqatsi contains and unreels some of the most breathtaking images ever committed to celluloid. Translated from the Hopi language, the title means 'life out of balance' and attempts - and very successfully - shows all of man's manifestations, usually in startling close-up but also often sped-up, juxtaposed against our own-made surroundings. Since Dziga Vertov's 1928 Russian experimental film "Man with a Movie Camera", a few pioneering directors have attempted to show familiar, and not so familiar surroundings in a new and refreshing way. But none so much as the collaboration here between Godfrey Reggio and contemporary composer Philip Glass. The images are always hypnotic, some unearthly beautiful and when it slowed to its climax, I was so disappointed it had finished. The comparisons between printed circuit boards to conveyor belt manufacturing to highly urbanised street scenes are magical and compulsive. Watch on the biggest screen you can and play the sound through a separate hi-fi or home cinema system. Glass' music follows and resonates with these streams of visuals - one is the other. With executive producers Francis Ford Copolla and George Lucas, both mega directors of their day, this project had some heavyweight backing. Koyaanisqatsi was followed by the not-quite-as-compulsive Powaqqatsi which has a different take on human activity.

    A mesmerizing stream of photography, sans-narration, set to an unforgettable score. Breathtakingly composed, it's like a guided tour of a master photog's personal portfolio, with lingering still shots mingling beautifully with their moving brethren. High-shutter landscape panoramas, silencing animated time-lapses and fast paced long-exposure peeks at civilization effectively capture the wonderful beauty we take for granted every day. A fantastically matched, epic-scale soundtrack by Philip Glass bumps it up yet another level, providing backbone and structure where it's most desperately needed. Midway through the picture, I was surprised to realize that I was thinking more during this sequence of mildly-related compositions than I ever had during a more traditional film. It's a stunner, something I can throw on at any time, in the middle of any chapter, and enjoy without hesitation. Pure beauty that's even more impressive considering its age, it's worth adding to any HD library.

    Videos strung together, coordinated with Phillip Glass' music. Nature (clouds, waves, mountains, shores) is described as beautiful, enduring, good. Humanity is ambushed as ugly, stupid, wasteful, enslaved, impoverished, ant-like, and injurious to the landscape. Cinematography: 5/10 I saw this in the late 1980s, and remember being quite impressed by the visuals. On the Hulu version I saw in 2013, I was not impressed at all. The focus was soft, the colors washed out, the contrast low. Incidental music: 5/10 Beyond irritating. When associated with humans in video, the music had the sort of manic activity one might associate with the Keystone Cops, but with oppressive overtones. Screenplay: 2/10 The point of view is 'nature is great, humanity is the opposite.'

    In the Hopi Language, Koyaanisqatsi means "life in chaos", or, as the film's tag-line indicates, "life out of balance". At the end of this documentary, we understand director Godfrey Reggio wanted to bring on screen the state of confusion and frenzy in which modern society lives in, thus the obscure-sounding word that he chose as the title of the film. But he also wanted to evoke the unbalance and damage we as humans inflict on the natural environment. This mesmerizing documentary does so without a voice-over or without the use of any conventional plot. It is kind of ironic that "Koyaanisqatsi" in portraying both natural landscapes and urban settings creates this mysteriously crafted harmony that is quite the contrary of live's chaotic essence. The massive use of time lapses, slow-motion, and super-impositions, the first two being quite common set-pieces for an average documentary, actually are essential in giving the film an artistically bold spirit very few other films achieved in a similar fashion. Without them, some of the most memorable sequences of the film would be impossible. For the magic to work, music is essential here. Philip Glass' score on "Koyaanisqatsi" is arguably the most acclaimed soundtrack he's ever written: hypnotic, busy and above all beautiful, it's a mixture between jazz, choral, and Classical, played with great subtly and delicacy. The album Glass made, extracted from the work he did on the film, is now a famous soundtrack album that is easily one of the pinnacles of Modern Classical music. An experience like no other, the obscure lyricism of "Koyaanisqatsi" is timeless and awe- inspiring: luckily it is now a cult film, easy to find and to share. Followed by two similar Essay films: "Powaqqatsi" and "Naqoyqatsi".

    Pleasant and haunting at the same time, the powerful combination of music synchronized with visuals and the chant at the beginning makes the film an experience that could well induce a trance in sensitive, intuitive people that can lead to a realization that Time is not linear in an absolute sense, and that the 'experience' of Time is multi dimensional  even leading to an experience of timelessness or Eternity. The film has universal symbolism about the contrast between raw, primordial nature that symbolizes the beginning of time for all practical purposes (creation), and technology that seemingly speeds up time as it approaches the end point of all technology  which is destruction. I am surprised that no one mentions that it symbolizes Time Fractals (concept developed by Terence Kenna- the process of the ever increasing rate of change of events in temporal reality culminating in the Eschaton ) and thereby gives us an inkling of the counter-concept of Time/Temporal Reality - and that is: Eternity ( in which both the concepts of change and static fail to apply). Incidentally, Mckenna developed the Time Fractals concept and the theory from the study of 'I Ching', but also co-related it with the Native American/ Meso-American concept of Circular Time in the process of the cycles of Creation-Destruction. Eternity is not an infinitely long period of linear time, and therefore eternity cannot be conceived by reason, only fleetingly felt or glimpsed in intuitive, synthesis experience. Linear time is conceived by rational thought working on memory, that then extrapolates its generalizations to extend this conceived linearity which is appropriately limited only to one's lifetime and therefore it is a misconception to generalize it beyond the memory, beyond the personal experiences and the History of mankind. This does not mean that linear time is a total misconception. It is only in linear time (can also be called objective time) that the synchronization of all the living, sentient beings of a world and (by extension) of the universe can possibly take place. The point here is that to make a 'leap of logic' to extend the validity of linear time indefinitely to the past and the future is fallacious and misleading. Even logically it is inconceivable that time extends infinitely backwards into the past  it brings up absurdities and paradoxes that cannot be cannot be resolved if we stick to a fixed conception of linear time that can be extended indefinitely into the past or future. One way of resolving this absurdity and paradox is to conceive of time as the rate of change of events taking place in the physical world, rather than stubbornly stick only to the notion of 'objective time as recorded by a clock' (a notion that has been 'hard programmed' into us by the standard science based educational system).

And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?

    Koyaanisqatsi contains and unreels some of the most breathtaking images ever committed to celluloid. Translated from the Hopi language, the title means 'life out of balance' and attempts - and very successfully - shows all of man's manifestations, usually in startling close-up but also often sped-up, juxtaposed against our own-made surroundings. Since Dziga Vertov's 1928 Russian experimental film "Man with a Movie Camera", a few pioneering directors have attempted to show familiar, and not so familiar surroundings in a new and refreshing way. But none so much as the collaboration here between Godfrey Reggio and contemporary composer Philip Glass. The images are always hypnotic, some unearthly beautiful and when it slowed to its climax, I was so disappointed it had finished. The comparisons between printed circuit boards to conveyor belt manufacturing to highly urbanised street scenes are magical and compulsive. Watch on the biggest screen you can and play the sound through a separate hi-fi or home cinema system. Glass' music follows and resonates with these streams of visuals - one is the other. With executive producers Francis Ford Copolla and George Lucas, both mega directors of their day, this project had some heavyweight backing. Koyaanisqatsi was followed by the not-quite-as-compulsive Powaqqatsi which has a different take on human activity.

    A mesmerizing stream of photography, sans-narration, set to an unforgettable score. Breathtakingly composed, it's like a guided tour of a master photog's personal portfolio, with lingering still shots mingling beautifully with their moving brethren. High-shutter landscape panoramas, silencing animated time-lapses and fast paced long-exposure peeks at civilization effectively capture the wonderful beauty we take for granted every day. A fantastically matched, epic-scale soundtrack by Philip Glass bumps it up yet another level, providing backbone and structure where it's most desperately needed. Midway through the picture, I was surprised to realize that I was thinking more during this sequence of mildly-related compositions than I ever had during a more traditional film. It's a stunner, something I can throw on at any time, in the middle of any chapter, and enjoy without hesitation. Pure beauty that's even more impressive considering its age, it's worth adding to any HD library.

    Videos strung together, coordinated with Phillip Glass' music. Nature (clouds, waves, mountains, shores) is described as beautiful, enduring, good. Humanity is ambushed as ugly, stupid, wasteful, enslaved, impoverished, ant-like, and injurious to the landscape. Cinematography: 5/10 I saw this in the late 1980s, and remember being quite impressed by the visuals. On the Hulu version I saw in 2013, I was not impressed at all. The focus was soft, the colors washed out, the contrast low. Incidental music: 5/10 Beyond irritating. When associated with humans in video, the music had the sort of manic activity one might associate with the Keystone Cops, but with oppressive overtones. Screenplay: 2/10 The point of view is 'nature is great, humanity is the opposite.'

    In the Hopi Language, Koyaanisqatsi means "life in chaos", or, as the film's tag-line indicates, "life out of balance". At the end of this documentary, we understand director Godfrey Reggio wanted to bring on screen the state of confusion and frenzy in which modern society lives in, thus the obscure-sounding word that he chose as the title of the film. But he also wanted to evoke the unbalance and damage we as humans inflict on the natural environment. This mesmerizing documentary does so without a voice-over or without the use of any conventional plot. It is kind of ironic that "Koyaanisqatsi" in portraying both natural landscapes and urban settings creates this mysteriously crafted harmony that is quite the contrary of live's chaotic essence. The massive use of time lapses, slow-motion, and super-impositions, the first two being quite common set-pieces for an average documentary, actually are essential in giving the film an artistically bold spirit very few other films achieved in a similar fashion. Without them, some of the most memorable sequences of the film would be impossible. For the magic to work, music is essential here. Philip Glass' score on "Koyaanisqatsi" is arguably the most acclaimed soundtrack he's ever written: hypnotic, busy and above all beautiful, it's a mixture between jazz, choral, and Classical, played with great subtly and delicacy. The album Glass made, extracted from the work he did on the film, is now a famous soundtrack album that is easily one of the pinnacles of Modern Classical music. An experience like no other, the obscure lyricism of "Koyaanisqatsi" is timeless and awe- inspiring: luckily it is now a cult film, easy to find and to share. Followed by two similar Essay films: "Powaqqatsi" and "Naqoyqatsi".

    Pleasant and haunting at the same time, the powerful combination of music synchronized with visuals and the chant at the beginning makes the film an experience that could well induce a trance in sensitive, intuitive people that can lead to a realization that Time is not linear in an absolute sense, and that the 'experience' of Time is multi dimensional  even leading to an experience of timelessness or Eternity. The film has universal symbolism about the contrast between raw, primordial nature that symbolizes the beginning of time for all practical purposes (creation), and technology that seemingly speeds up time as it approaches the end point of all technology  which is destruction. I am surprised that no one mentions that it symbolizes Time Fractals (concept developed by Terence Kenna- the process of the ever increasing rate of change of events in temporal reality culminating in the Eschaton ) and thereby gives us an inkling of the counter-concept of Time/Temporal Reality - and that is: Eternity ( in which both the concepts of change and static fail to apply). Incidentally, Mckenna developed the Time Fractals concept and the theory from the study of 'I Ching', but also co-related it with the Native American/ Meso-American concept of Circular Time in the process of the cycles of Creation-Destruction. Eternity is not an infinitely long period of linear time, and therefore eternity cannot be conceived by reason, only fleetingly felt or glimpsed in intuitive, synthesis experience. Linear time is conceived by rational thought working on memory, that then extrapolates its generalizations to extend this conceived linearity which is appropriately limited only to one's lifetime and therefore it is a misconception to generalize it beyond the memory, beyond the personal experiences and the History of mankind. This does not mean that linear time is a total misconception. It is only in linear time (can also be called objective time) that the synchronization of all the living, sentient beings of a world and (by extension) of the universe can possibly take place. The point here is that to make a 'leap of logic' to extend the validity of linear time indefinitely to the past and the future is fallacious and misleading. Even logically it is inconceivable that time extends infinitely backwards into the past  it brings up absurdities and paradoxes that cannot be cannot be resolved if we stick to a fixed conception of linear time that can be extended indefinitely into the past or future. One way of resolving this absurdity and paradox is to conceive of time as the rate of change of events taking place in the physical world, rather than stubbornly stick only to the notion of 'objective time as recorded by a clock' (a notion that has been 'hard programmed' into us by the standard science based educational system). Secondly, when we are in a synthesis, intuitive or imaginative mode of experience, these fixed notions of linear time are necessarily suspended for this mode of experience to be of any significance.

    I have seen some good feature length documentary films that have featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and a few good experimental films are included as well, so I was intrigued by this combination of the two genres, from director Godfrey Reggio and executive producer Francis Ford Coppola. The title is a Hopi Indian term for "life out of balance", the film has no dialogue whatsoever, including no voice-over narration, it is simply a visual concert of moving images, including many slowed down and sped up, with music to accompany the footage. The film does not have a traditionally structured plot, but the scenario is definite starting from what essentially the origins of Earth in the large scale deserted and beautiful landscapes moving into the world of industry and civilisation. We see various images throughout that tell the story of the world we live in, including the sight of cloud formations, ocean waves, a rocket being blasted into space, a quarry work site, factories and station, cityscapes and lights going on and off, sunrises and sunsets, people walking through their environments, traffic moving on all types of road, people working, machines producing various goods, convenience environments, leisure environments, and many more man-made elements in everyday life. The key message of the film is ultimately that life is out of balance, full of craziness, in turmoil, in some ways disintegrating and however you look at it there is always something that comes along to change the way to go on living, for good or for bad. The music by composer Phillip Glass is absolutely magnificent, sometimes deliberately repetitive to give the sense of routine in life, and the chanting of the title "Koyaanisqatsi" is intoxicating, the film using juxtaposing natural wonders with sometimes bleak man-made industry is cleverly done, it may ache your eyes slightly with footage speeding and slowing throughout, but overall it is a highly watchable and engaging experimental documentary. Good!

    There are two ways I can think of to review a movie: The first is to simply describe the movie, the second is to futilely try to analyze the movie. Neither of these options seemed to work on this film, but I was reminded of something: During the American tour for My Bloody Valentine's immensely influential album Loveless, the band experimented with their audiences' ability to sustain music played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the tour, "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." This is as good of a review of Koyaanisqatsi as I could think of.

    From the Hopi language, Koyaanisqatsi is a word that roughly translates as "crazy life," or "a life out of balance," or perhaps more appropriately, "a way of life that calls for another way of living." Incidentally, that's exactly what this film shows: no plot or story, just a document of the modern age of man, far out of balance from nature, which calls for human beings to adapt to their own constructs. This film doesn't offer any conventional story with any characters; it's purely an experience built from images and sound, to illicit thought and feeling in the viewers. Both the images and music are beautiful in their own ways: with Phillip Glass' epic, well-structured music score, the film takes on a palpable rhythm and mood that perfectly accentuates the gorgeous scenery. The film plays around a lot with time-lapse footage and slow-motion, which serve to show common cityscapes in an invoking new way. Altogether, the film is as hypnotic and mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking. This film was cobbled together from all kinds of footage filmed across the United States from 1975 to 1983, with a tight budget. Regardless, the filmmakers show superb prowess with their photography and editing skills. At least on a technical level, they've maximized their potential and tools to craft an audio/visual masterpiece, weaving the images and music to the themes implied with the term Koyaanisqatsi. As far as the content goes, like any piece of art, it's left to the viewer's interpretation. The most opaque of themes will revolve around civilization's progress, the depletion of nature, and the effects of technology and industrialization on the human race. There are times in the film where humanity seems triumphant, and other times where it feels like it's spinning out of control in a downward spiral of chaos and destruction (especially in one of the film's final shots, depicting an Atlas-Centaur rocket exploding; it's a sequence that's always hit me the hardest, given the combination of imagery, music, and the overall theme that human civilization rises so high, but will eventually crash and burn). Watching this film is not only a treat for the eyes and ears, but also a sobering, moving experience unlike any other. I believe it truly represents the best and worst of the human race in the modern age, and everybody should see it at least once in a lifetime. 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)

    This strange title hide a movie which critics the world of today, who is evolve constantly but since the human is living on this planet, the pollution is common. "Koyaanisqatsi" is an awesome movie for cinema lover peoples because it contains fabulous images and a wonderful music. This movie make us think about the actions of the human on the environment. After watched this movie, i realize the earth changed a lot since the human use it. But, i think some shots in this movie are a bit slow. Directed by an unknown people with the name of Godfrey Reggio, formerly monk, this movie will stays in my mind and i don't will hesitate to watch it again. A must see movie.

    This should have been ideal for me. I am always on the lookout for transcendent vision, and second to the real journey is only the cinematic ritual. Herzog does it for me, Tarkovsky and his rituals about time inside time. And I firmly believe it has done quite a bit of harm to think the universe is telling some sort of story, it has misled us to devise arcs and expect story-answers, so I welcome any attempt that aspires to push against the boundaries of thought and narrative. That is always the essential ritual, only the tool that allows the dancer to submerge himself beyond thought and description, to where he can be one with dance that means itself. I will not deny the man the powerful dance of his images, or the dedicated craft, but the ending reveals him to be shallow in the reach and depth of his meditation (if you were on the fence before). And it matters that this narrows the world by so much, because a lot of people are coming to it for a worldview and willing to open up. His "life out of balance"(Koyaanisqatsi) is "a state of life that calls for another way of living". It is just small view to contrast natural 'purity' with the evils and violence of man-made technology. Worse, it is every bit as idealized and un-natural as seeking out panoramas of skies for their extraordinariness. You can suspect that the filmmakers had to sift through a lot of unexciting shots of nature until they could settle on images that were nature as they wanted it to be, more 'natural' than others. And passing that as spiritual vision narrows the world, because it forces harmony where actual nature has turbulence built into it, stochastic chaos, and that forces a story of something originally pure and stable -paradise- that we are separate from and uprooting, and this sort of religious thinking only further separates us from the natural world. It also ignores fundamental dynamics of the real thing. For one, "life out of balance" is the natural way, it is why everything exists in the first place; planets are in position, because universal space exploded in that first minute of creation. I wonder if he was blind to it in his own images of swirling clouds and sand-particles. Moreover, we are indeed, doing a lot of destructively rapid , short-sighted terraforming of our own next to nature's, and a lot of our contraptions break, but wouldn't it be much more agreeable to counterpoint that with some of the many wonderful advances we have made on the backs of failure? Being able to separate now poisonous from edible and medicinal plants, means people died in the discovery, brave and curious explorers. And this guy is just not a very curious explorer to me. He has traveled far and captured amazing things on tape. But, it seems as if all has to fit into that one image, instead of one image splintering to reveal a multitude of reflections. His craft reveals as much; it strives for controlled perfection, omniscience, monumental depiction, clean boundaries, in every bit the same way as Riefenstahl fought in her films to choreograph the world into her own image of idealized sensuality - confused for spiritual. It's no wonder Coppola was so smitten by this he put his name and money on it, a similarly over-zealous man enthralled (at one point) by 'mystical' nature. Both, by their overly zealous approach to freeze transcendence, reveal in a roundabout way the limitations of the human model criticized here: we are at odds with this being an imperfect , chaotic world, so when the film ends with footage of burning space rocket debris cascading from the skies, the notion is not acceptance of the inevitable end of things, but a cautionary lament: if only we lived another way, things wouldn't blow up in our face. And there is simply no such way to live, not without skiing on imbalance, which is why life is exciting in the first place. And we all have to live with the fact every single day. The energy world has to daily spend a large amount simply to make-up for turbulent energy loss, because that is nature's way. And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?

    From the Hopi language, Koyaanisqatsi is a word that roughly translates as "crazy life," or "a life out of balance," or perhaps more appropriately, "a way of life that calls for another way of living." Incidentally, that's exactly what this film shows: no plot or story, just a document of the modern age of man, far out of balance from nature, which calls for human beings to adapt to their own constructs. This film doesn't offer any conventional story with any characters; it's purely an experience built from images and sound, to illicit thought and feeling in the viewers. Both the images and music are beautiful in their own ways: with Phillip Glass' epic, well-structured music score, the film takes on a palpable rhythm and mood that perfectly accentuates the gorgeous scenery. The film plays around a lot with time-lapse footage and slow-motion, which serve to show common cityscapes in an invoking new way. Altogether, the film is as hypnotic and mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking. This film was cobbled together from all kinds of footage filmed across the United States from 1975 to 1983, with a tight budget. Regardless, the filmmakers show superb prowess with their photography and editing skills. At least on a technical level, they've maximized their potential and tools to craft an audio/visual masterpiece, weaving the images and music to the themes implied with the term Koyaanisqatsi. As far as the content goes, like any piece of art, it's left to the viewer's interpretation. The most opaque of themes will revolve around civilization's progress, the depletion of nature, and the effects of technology and industrialization on the human race. There are times in the film where humanity seems triumphant, and other times where it feels like it's spinning out of control in a downward spiral of chaos and destruction (especially in one of the film's final shots, depicting an Atlas-Centaur rocket exploding; it's a sequence that's always hit me the hardest, given the combination of imagery, music, and the overall theme that human civilization rises so high, but will eventually crash and burn). Watching this film is not only a treat for the eyes and ears, but also a sobering, moving experience unlike any other. I believe it truly represents the best and worst of the human race in the modern age, and everybody should see it at least once in a lifetime. 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)

    This strange title hide a movie which critics the world of today, who is evolve constantly but since the human is living on this planet, the pollution is common. "Koyaanisqatsi" is an awesome movie for cinema lover peoples because it contains fabulous images and a wonderful music. This movie make us think about the actions of the human on the environment. After watched this movie, i realize the earth changed a lot since the human use it. But, i think some shots in this movie are a bit slow. Directed by an unknown people with the name of Godfrey Reggio, formerly monk, this movie will stays in my mind and i don't will hesitate to watch it again. A must see movie.

    This should have been ideal for me. I am always on the lookout for transcendent vision, and second to the real journey is only the cinematic ritual. Herzog does it for me, Tarkovsky and his rituals about time inside time. And I firmly believe it has done quite a bit of harm to think the universe is telling some sort of story, it has misled us to devise arcs and expect story-answers, so I welcome any attempt that aspires to push against the boundaries of thought and narrative. That is always the essential ritual, only the tool that allows the dancer to submerge himself beyond thought and description, to where he can be one with dance that means itself. I will not deny the man the powerful dance of his images, or the dedicated craft, but the ending reveals him to be shallow in the reach and depth of his meditation (if you were on the fence before). And it matters that this narrows the world by so much, because a lot of people are coming to it for a worldview and willing to open up. His "life out of balance"(Koyaanisqatsi) is "a state of life that calls for another way of living". It is just small view to contrast natural 'purity' with the evils and violence of man-made technology. Worse, it is every bit as idealized and un-natural as seeking out panoramas of skies for their extraordinariness. You can suspect that the filmmakers had to sift through a lot of unexciting shots of nature until they could settle on images that were nature as they wanted it to be, more 'natural' than others. And passing that as spiritual vision narrows the world, because it forces harmony where actual nature has turbulence built into it, stochastic chaos, and that forces a story of something originally pure and stable -paradise- that we are separate from and uprooting, and this sort of religious thinking only further separates us from the natural world. It also ignores fundamental dynamics of the real thing. For one, "life out of balance" is the natural way, it is why everything exists in the first place; planets are in position, because universal space exploded in that first minute of creation. I wonder if he was blind to it in his own images of swirling clouds and sand-particles. Moreover, we are indeed, doing a lot of destructively rapid , short-sighted terraforming of our own next to nature's, and a lot of our contraptions break, but wouldn't it be much more agreeable to counterpoint that with some of the many wonderful advances we have made on the backs of failure? Being able to separate now poisonous from edible and medicinal plants, means people died in the discovery, brave and curious explorers. And this guy is just not a very curious explorer to me. He has traveled far and captured amazing things on tape. But, it seems as if all has to fit into that one image, instead of one image splintering to reveal a multitude of reflections. His craft reveals as much; it strives for controlled perfection, omniscience, monumental depiction, clean boundaries, in every bit the same way as Riefenstahl fought in her films to choreograph the world into her own image of idealized sensuality - confused for spiritual. It's no wonder Coppola was so smitten by this he put his name and money on it, a similarly over-zealous man enthralled (at one point) by 'mystical' nature. Both, by their overly zealous approach to freeze transcendence, reveal in a roundabout way the limitations of the human model criticized here: we are at odds with this being an imperfect , chaotic world, so when the film ends with footage of burning space rocket debris cascading from the skies, the notion is not acceptance of the inevitable end of things, but a cautionary lament: if only we lived another way, things wouldn't blow up in our face. And there is simply no such way to live, not without skiing on imbalance, which is why life is exciting in the first place. And we all have to live with the fact every single day. The energy world has to daily spend a large amount simply to make-up for turbulent energy loss, because that is nature's way. And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?

    Koyaanisqatsi contains and unreels some of the most breathtaking images ever committed to celluloid. Translated from the Hopi language, the title means 'life out of balance' and attempts - and very successfully - shows all of man's manifestations, usually in startling close-up but also often sped-up, juxtaposed against our own-made surroundings. Since Dziga Vertov's 1928 Russian experimental film "Man with a Movie Camera", a few pioneering directors have attempted to show familiar, and not so familiar surroundings in a new and refreshing way. But none so much as the collaboration here between Godfrey Reggio and contemporary composer Philip Glass. The images are always hypnotic, some unearthly beautiful and when it slowed to its climax, I was so disappointed it had finished. The comparisons between printed circuit boards to conveyor belt manufacturing to highly urbanised street scenes are magical and compulsive. Watch on the biggest screen you can and play the sound through a separate hi-fi or home cinema system. Glass' music follows and resonates with these streams of visuals - one is the other. With executive producers Francis Ford Copolla and George Lucas, both mega directors of their day, this project had some heavyweight backing. Koyaanisqatsi was followed by the not-quite-as-compulsive Powaqqatsi which has a different take on human activity.

    A mesmerizing stream of photography, sans-narration, set to an unforgettable score. Breathtakingly composed, it's like a guided tour of a master photog's personal portfolio, with lingering still shots mingling beautifully with their moving brethren. High-shutter landscape panoramas, silencing animated time-lapses and fast paced long-exposure peeks at civilization effectively capture the wonderful beauty we take for granted every day. A fantastically matched, epic-scale soundtrack by Philip Glass bumps it up yet another level, providing backbone and structure where it's most desperately needed. Midway through the picture, I was surprised to realize that I was thinking more during this sequence of mildly-related compositions than I ever had during a more traditional film. It's a stunner, something I can throw on at any time, in the middle of any chapter, and enjoy without hesitation. Pure beauty that's even more impressive considering its age, it's worth adding to any HD library.
