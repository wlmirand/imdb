 <sinopse>
  Tom Regan, an advisor to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A highly styled 'genre' film which can perhaps be seen as a pastiche of all gangster movies. Tom Reagan is the laconic anti-hero of this amoral tale which is also, paradoxically, a look at morals within the criminal underworld of the 1930s. Two rival gangs vie for control of a city where the police are pawns, and the periodic busts of illicit drinking establishments are no more than a way for one gang to get back at the other. Black humour and shocking violence compete for screen time as we question whether or not Tom, right-hand man of the Irish mob leader, really has a heart.

    It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody  except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film. Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance. And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion. Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi. That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes. And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny. And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death  and nothing else mattered.

    Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers. Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role. Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay view, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them. First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order: Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual. Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him. Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved." Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes. As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

    Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best. Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems. Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching. Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.

    Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough. I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.

    Well i saw this movie in 2013. But being a fan of Gangster movies i was expecting it to be a great movie the rating was pretty good as well..but after seeing this movie I was irritated and was wishing it to get over as soon as possible. It starts slowly from the very starting and moves with that pace through out. I specially take a look at the cast before downloading and watching the movie and there wasn't a single actor/actress with whom i was familiar yet the rating pushed me to download the movie and eventually i feel like i wasted my 2 hours. About the Movie... It revolves around one guy i.e Gabriel Byrne who is an adviser of a Crime boss and he gets himself in trouble by having an affair with the Boss's girlfriend eventually spoiling his relations with the Boss. Then he shifts to another mob where hes lying every time and manipulating the Boss. Finally in the end he clears himself from all the mess he created. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!!....i was expecting this to be something like Donnie Brasco , Goodfellas or carlito's way but its nowhere near them. CRAPPY BORING MOVIE!

    Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void. The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves. Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all? We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories. This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink. So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.

    Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties. What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way. The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo"). A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is). Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters. How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

    Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin. I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new. This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings. Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna. Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.

    It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody  except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film. Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance. And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion. Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi. That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes. And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny. And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death  and nothing else mattered.

    Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers. Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role. Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay view, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them. First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order: Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual. Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him. Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved." Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes. As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

    Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best. Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems. Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching. Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.

    Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough. I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.

    Well i saw this movie in 2013. But being a fan of Gangster movies i was expecting it to be a great movie the rating was pretty good as well..but after seeing this movie I was irritated and was wishing it to get over as soon as possible. It starts slowly from the very starting and moves with that pace through out. I specially take a look at the cast before downloading and watching the movie and there wasn't a single actor/actress with whom i was familiar yet the rating pushed me to download the movie and eventually i feel like i wasted my 2 hours. About the Movie... It revolves around one guy i.e Gabriel Byrne who is an adviser of a Crime boss and he gets himself in trouble by having an affair with the Boss's girlfriend eventually spoiling his relations with the Boss. Then he shifts to another mob where hes lying every time and manipulating the Boss. Finally in the end he clears himself from all the mess he created. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!!....i was expecting this to be something like Donnie Brasco , Goodfellas or carlito's way but its nowhere near them. CRAPPY BORING MOVIE!

    Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void. The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves. Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all? We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories. This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink. So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.

    Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties. What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way. The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo"). A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is). Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters. How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

    Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin. I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new. This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings. Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna. Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.

    It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody  except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film. Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance. And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion. Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi. That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes. And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny. And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death  and nothing else mattered.

    Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers. Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role. Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay view, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them. First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order: Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual. Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him. Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved." Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes. As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

    Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best. Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems. Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching. Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.

    Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough. I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.

    Well i saw this movie in 2013. But being a fan of Gangster movies i was expecting it to be a great movie the rating was pretty good as well..but after seeing this movie I was irritated and was wishing it to get over as soon as possible. It starts slowly from the very starting and moves with that pace through out. I specially take a look at the cast before downloading and watching the movie and there wasn't a single actor/actress with whom i was familiar yet the rating pushed me to download the movie and eventually i feel like i wasted my 2 hours. About the Movie... It revolves around one guy i.e Gabriel Byrne who is an adviser of a Crime boss and he gets himself in trouble by having an affair with the Boss's girlfriend eventually spoiling his relations with the Boss. Then he shifts to another mob where hes lying every time and manipulating the Boss. Finally in the end he clears himself from all the mess he created. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!!....i was expecting this to be something like Donnie Brasco , Goodfellas or carlito's way but its nowhere near them. CRAPPY BORING MOVIE!

    Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void. The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves. Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all? We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories. This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink. So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.

    Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties. What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way. The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo"). A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is). Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters. How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

    Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin. I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new. This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings. Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna. Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.

    It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody  except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film. Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance. And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion. Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi. That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes. And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny. And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death  and nothing else mattered.

    Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers. Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role. Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay view, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them. First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order: Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual. Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him. Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved." Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes. As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

    Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best. Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems. Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching. Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.

    Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough. I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.

    Well i saw this movie in 2013. But being a fan of Gangster movies i was expecting it to be a great movie the rating was pretty good as well..but after seeing this movie I was irritated and was wishing it to get over as soon as possible. It starts slowly from the very starting and moves with that pace through out. I specially take a look at the cast before downloading and watching the movie and there wasn't a single actor/actress with whom i was familiar yet the rating pushed me to download the movie and eventually i feel like i wasted my 2 hours. About the Movie... It revolves around one guy i.e Gabriel Byrne who is an adviser of a Crime boss and he gets himself in trouble by having an affair with the Boss's girlfriend eventually spoiling his relations with the Boss. Then he shifts to another mob where hes lying every time and manipulating the Boss. Finally in the end he clears himself from all the mess he created. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!!....i was expecting this to be something like Donnie Brasco , Goodfellas or carlito's way but its nowhere near them. CRAPPY BORING MOVIE!

    Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void. The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves. Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all? We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories. This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink. So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.

    Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties. What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way. The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo"). A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is). Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters. How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

    Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin. I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new. This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings. Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna. Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.

    It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody  except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film. Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance. And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion. Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi. That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes. And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny. And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death  and nothing else mattered.

    Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers. Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role. Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay view, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them. First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order: Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual. Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him. Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved." Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes. As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

    Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best. Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems. Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching. Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.

    Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough. I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.

    Well i saw this movie in 2013. But being a fan of Gangster movies i was expecting it to be a great movie the rating was pretty good as well..but after seeing this movie I was irritated and was wishing it to get over as soon as possible. It starts slowly from the very starting and moves with that pace through out. I specially take a look at the cast before downloading and watching the movie and there wasn't a single actor/actress with whom i was familiar yet the rating pushed me to download the movie and eventually i feel like i wasted my 2 hours. About the Movie... It revolves around one guy i.e Gabriel Byrne who is an adviser of a Crime boss and he gets himself in trouble by having an affair with the Boss's girlfriend eventually spoiling his relations with the Boss. Then he shifts to another mob where hes lying every time and manipulating the Boss. Finally in the end he clears himself from all the mess he created. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!!....i was expecting this to be something like Donnie Brasco , Goodfellas or carlito's way but its nowhere near them. CRAPPY BORING MOVIE!

    Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void. The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves. Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all? We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories. This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink. So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.

    Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties. What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way. The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo"). A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is). Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters. How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

    Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin. I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new. This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings. Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna. Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.

    It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody  except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film. Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance. And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion. Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi. That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes. And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny. And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death  and nothing else mattered.

    Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers. Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role. Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay view, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them. First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order: Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual. Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him. Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved." Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes. As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

    Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best. Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems. Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching. Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.

    Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough. I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.

    Well i saw this movie in 2013. But being a fan of Gangster movies i was expecting it to be a great movie the rating was pretty good as well..but after seeing this movie I was irritated and was wishing it to get over as soon as possible. It starts slowly from the very starting and moves with that pace through out. I specially take a look at the cast before downloading and watching the movie and there wasn't a single actor/actress with whom i was familiar yet the rating pushed me to download the movie and eventually i feel like i wasted my 2 hours. About the Movie... It revolves around one guy i.e Gabriel Byrne who is an adviser of a Crime boss and he gets himself in trouble by having an affair with the Boss's girlfriend eventually spoiling his relations with the Boss. Then he shifts to another mob where hes lying every time and manipulating the Boss. Finally in the end he clears himself from all the mess he created. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!!....i was expecting this to be something like Donnie Brasco , Goodfellas or carlito's way but its nowhere near them. CRAPPY BORING MOVIE!

    Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void. The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves. Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all? We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories. This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink. So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.

    Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties. What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way. The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo"). A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is). Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters. How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

    Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin. I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new. This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings. Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna. Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.

    It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody  except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film. Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance. And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion. Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi. That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes. And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny. And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death  and nothing else mattered.

    Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers. Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role. Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay view, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them. First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order: Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual. Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him. Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved." Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes. As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching. Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.

    Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough. I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.

    Well i saw this movie in 2013. But being a fan of Gangster movies i was expecting it to be a great movie the rating was pretty good as well..but after seeing this movie I was irritated and was wishing it to get over as soon as possible. It starts slowly from the very starting and moves with that pace through out. I specially take a look at the cast before downloading and watching the movie and there wasn't a single actor/actress with whom i was familiar yet the rating pushed me to download the movie and eventually i feel like i wasted my 2 hours. About the Movie... It revolves around one guy i.e Gabriel Byrne who is an adviser of a Crime boss and he gets himself in trouble by having an affair with the Boss's girlfriend eventually spoiling his relations with the Boss. Then he shifts to another mob where hes lying every time and manipulating the Boss. Finally in the end he clears himself from all the mess he created. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!!....i was expecting this to be something like Donnie Brasco , Goodfellas or carlito's way but its nowhere near them. CRAPPY BORING MOVIE!

    Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void. The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves. Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all? We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories. This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink. So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.

    Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties. What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way. The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo"). A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is). Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters. How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

    Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin. I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new. This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings. Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna. Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.

    It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody  except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film. Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance. And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion. Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi. That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes. And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny. And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death  and nothing else mattered.

    Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers. Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role. Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay view, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them. First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order: Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual. Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him. Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved." Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes. As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

    Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best. Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems. Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching. Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.

    Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough. I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.

    Well i saw this movie in 2013. But being a fan of Gangster movies i was expecting it to be a great movie the rating was pretty good as well..but after seeing this movie I was irritated and was wishing it to get over as soon as possible. It starts slowly from the very starting and moves with that pace through out. I specially take a look at the cast before downloading and watching the movie and there wasn't a single actor/actress with whom i was familiar yet the rating pushed me to download the movie and eventually i feel like i wasted my 2 hours. About the Movie... It revolves around one guy i.e Gabriel Byrne who is an adviser of a Crime boss and he gets himself in trouble by having an affair with the Boss's girlfriend eventually spoiling his relations with the Boss. Then he shifts to another mob where hes lying every time and manipulating the Boss. Finally in the end he clears himself from all the mess he created. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!!....i was expecting this to be something like Donnie Brasco , Goodfellas or carlito's way but its nowhere near them. CRAPPY BORING MOVIE!

    Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void. The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves. Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all? We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories. This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink. So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.

    Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties. What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way. The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo"). A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is). Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters. How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

    Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin. I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new. This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings. Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna. Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.

    It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody  except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film. Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance. And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion. Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi. That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes. And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny. And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death  and nothing else mattered.

    Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers. Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role. Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay view, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them. First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order: Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual. Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him. Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved." Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes. As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

    Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best. Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems. Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching. Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.

    Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough. I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.

    Well i saw this movie in 2013. But being a fan of Gangster movies i was expecting it to be a great movie the rating was pretty good as well..but after seeing this movie I was irritated and was wishing it to get over as soon as possible. It starts slowly from the very starting and moves with that pace through out. I specially take a look at the cast before downloading and watching the movie and there wasn't a single actor/actress with whom i was familiar yet the rating pushed me to download the movie and eventually i feel like i wasted my 2 hours. About the Movie... It revolves around one guy i.e Gabriel Byrne who is an adviser of a Crime boss and he gets himself in trouble by having an affair with the Boss's girlfriend eventually spoiling his relations with the Boss. Then he shifts to another mob where hes lying every time and manipulating the Boss. Finally in the end he clears himself from all the mess he created. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!!....i was expecting this to be something like Donnie Brasco , Goodfellas or carlito's way but its nowhere near them. CRAPPY BORING MOVIE!

    Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void. The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves. Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all? We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories. This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink. So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.

    Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties. What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way. The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo"). A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is). Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters. How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

    Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin. I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new. This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings. Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna. Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.

    It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody  except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film. Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance. And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion. Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi. That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes. And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny. And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death  and nothing else mattered.

    Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers. Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role. Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay view, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them. First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order: Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual. Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him. Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved." Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes. As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

    Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best. Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems. Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching. Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.

    Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough. I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.

    Well i saw this movie in 2013. But being a fan of Gangster movies i was expecting it to be a great movie the rating was pretty good as well..but after seeing this movie I was irritated and was wishing it to get over as soon as possible. It starts slowly from the very starting and moves with that pace through out. I specially take a look at the cast before downloading and watching the movie and there wasn't a single actor/actress with whom i was familiar yet the rating pushed me to download the movie and eventually i feel like i wasted my 2 hours. About the Movie... It revolves around one guy i.e Gabriel Byrne who is an adviser of a Crime boss and he gets himself in trouble by having an affair with the Boss's girlfriend eventually spoiling his relations with the Boss. Then he shifts to another mob where hes lying every time and manipulating the Boss. Finally in the end he clears himself from all the mess he created. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!!....i was expecting this to be something like Donnie Brasco , Goodfellas or carlito's way but its nowhere near them. CRAPPY BORING MOVIE!

    Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void. The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves. Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all? We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories. This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink. So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.

    Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties. What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way. The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo"). A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is). Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list. Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters. How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

    Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin. I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new. This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings. Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna. Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.
