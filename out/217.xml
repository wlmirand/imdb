He is captured and imprisoned by the undead vampire Dracula, who travels to London, inspired by a photograph of Harker's betrothed, Mina Murray.

    "Over the years all these vampire movies have come out and nobody looks like a vampire anymore." Johnny Depp Most of the time, vampires aren't my thing, although I loved "Interview With A Vampire," the movie and the book. Anne Rice does vampire. Johnny Depp ain't my thing, either, pretty much, although I confess that I've watched "Edward Scissorhands" repeatedly. And I guess pirates aren't my thing, pretty much, either.... But --- "...nobody looks like a vampire anymore"? That's deep truth. You want vampire? First, you have to read Dracula. Bram Stoker did vampire the right way. You want a white-knuckle "chase scene"? Try chasing Dracula by stagecoach through the mountains back to his castle in Transylvania.... Then you should watch "Nosferatu" (1922) if you want to do this thing right. Then you have to see the 1931 version of the "Dracula" movies. Then you have to put Bela Lugosi's poster picture on your wall. Keep looking at it. Then you can watch the 1992 "Dracula" with Gary Oldman. Put his poster on the wall. Stare at that one for a while. Now you're ready to talk vampire talk. Â…and by the way, I didn't like "Dark Shadows," there are lots of good reasons why the film never made it to the hit parade....for one thing, it doesn't have any Transylvanian stagecoaches, duh....

    I've been in love with the Dracula story for a long time now. Bela Lugosi as Dracula was just my cup of tea. Yes, it was a long time ago and the acting was more overdone than today, but I still loved it to my heart. And then I watched this. I love Gary Oldman, I adore Keanu Reeves, and I worship Anthony Hopkins. ALL of them were terrible in this movie. All. of. them! How is this even possible? And don't even let me start on Winona Ryder. I've really, really tried to like her since I saw her in Beetlejuice. But everything else she did just doesn't to it for me. I'm doing this as a review of the movie as a movie, not an adaptation of the book. The movie was really boring to watch. The curves of action and interesting stuff happening had not pattern what so ever. It looked very interesting in the trailer, especially when I heard Oldman's laughter as Dracula, but I was really disappointed. The acting. Oh god the acting. I don't know where to start. I really cringed and sat with a "what the deuce"-expression in my face during the Dracula's Brides-scene with Keanu Reeves being seduced by some horny naked vampires. I get it, vampires are sexy nowadays, especially the women. I get the seduction. But really? He only looked at them and BOOM he looked like he was getting the pleasure of his life. And when he overly dramatically said "Music!? Those ANIMALS!?", after Gary Oldman had said the famous "The children of the night! What music they make!"- line, and it sounded like he said it without having nostrils, I really couldn't take any of them seriously at all. Gary Oldman has a huge repertoire as an actor and it is just awesome! But what happened here Oldman? Where you drunk? Did you eat something that made your bowel movements go "oops"? Did you watch some kind of sad children's movie before you got on set? Because it sure looks like you did these things. Him as Dracula did just not work at all! I don't know what I should say about the accent, too thick for my taste. I have no idea what a Transylvanian accent sounds like, but I didn't like it this time. Anthony Hopkins didn't make it to me either. I love his action usually, but here something happened to him. He was fitting as a Van Helsing, he did it OK, but there was no real feeling to it. It felt like he was just thrown into the movie by Coppola, saying to him: "Could you just do this scene very quickly? Then you can go home". And Winona Ryder. Poor girl really can't act any more. There is this dead, boring aura around here that won't go away. It's like she knows there is a camera there and she wants to shine as the best actress you'll ever see. She wants to be Meryl Streep, but she is and stays Winona Ryder. No more. And I think the scene where she finds out that "her love" is Dracula and he killed Lucy. She cries for less than fifteen seconds. Then she clumsily, and very unromantically, says "I love you". And the "Take me away from all this death" line? Uhm, honey, you're talking to Dracula. He kills people every bloody night. You want to be a part of him forever? You're gonna have a bad time. And Sadie Frost: stop acting like you're in an adult movie. Getting bitten in the neck and being sick isn't pleasurable, like you make it sound. It is supposed to hurt, not give you pleasure spasms. And I can't even say how annoyed I was by some of the "special effects". The blood coming out from Dracula's "torso", his wrinkled face floating in the sky like in a badly made goth metal band's album cover, I could rant about so much more, but I have one thing I want to say did go well. The makeup. Dracula's form as a bat and an old man was actually pretty scary. Whoever did the makeup made Dracula look frightening and threatening, which I don't see too often. The same with Lucy's vampire makeup. Maybe a bit overdone (we're talking the whitest of the white faces you'll ever see), but scary. I just got annoyed by thinking of the poor child being so frightened of her that they had to really, really sweet talk with her to do the scene. But credits and stars to the makeup artists. Thumbs down and shaking of heads to the rest, especially you Coppola. You did great with the Godfather. Don't ever make vampire movies again, please.

    Some mind-bogglingly bad performances have been captured on film. Exhibit A: Al Pacino's laugh-out-loud performance in the notoriously overrated SCARFACE. "Who joo talking to...?" Exhibit B: Martin Landau's who-gives-a-f*** turn as Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD. Exhibit C: Nicole "You gotta be kiddin' me" Kidman in COLD MOUNTAIN (or whatever it was called). Exhibit D: EVERYBODY in DICK TRACY (ESPECIALLY Masdonna and Warren Beatty). Exhibit E: Jeff Bridges in the American remake of THE VANISHING. I could go on (and on and on; this's an EASY one, once you get started), but time's a'wastin'. I'm here to talk about Gary Oldman in "BRAM STOKER'S" Dracula. (Wynona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were TRYING, damn it, though Anthony Hopkins just phoned it in- again...) Oldman's mangling of whatever accents he was attempting is hilarious to watch: he may well have had a mouthful of marbles (it would explain a lot). The movie LOOKS great, but there are times when Looks just ain't enough. THIS is one of them times. Rewriting Stoker is never a good idea; filmmakers do so at their own peril. The "origin" story of Dracula, lifted from the black and white Dracula LIVES! Marvel Comics magazine, adds little to the film (well, it extends the running time, but that's about all). Next time around (and there WILL be a next time; you can count on it), maybe it'd be a good idea to just do it By The Book. And, while I'm at it, whoever's up next with an attempt at a theatrical version of Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND should get a copy of HIS script for same from Gauntlet Press; it sure as s*** couldn't hurt...

    If you haven't read the book then yes you may like this movie. However, I read the book and I was very disappointed. I know that most movies aren't EXACTLY like the book. But this movie added so much crap that it didn't follow the book very well. All of the people that keep calling this "Bram Stoker's Dracula" are idiots. This isn't his, it's Hollywood's. I am sure a lot of them didn't read the book. The book is long and a little old and I did get bored. However, I am sad to say I liked it a lot better than the movie. It is annoying how some people are trying to compare it to the book who haven't read the book. Couldn't sound less illiterate! Please don't make reviews and say something like "I didn't read the book, but I thought this movie was great." Just base your judgment on the movie then and don't think you have an opinion to compare.

    I read the novel and finished it about one week and the next day i watched the movie. Well, i just want to say that if i watched the movie without read the novel first i would have given a better rating maybe 8. Its not a bad movie but very unfaithful and disrespect the novel. I am disappointed with this flicks because the title is the straightforward "BRAM STOKER'S Dracula". Bram himself should be regretting himself to wrote the good book and abused after his rest in the grave. ***SPOILER***WARNING!!! 1. The film clearly abused the novel with humanizing the Dracula, how the Dracula feels regret when turning Mina into vampire and all other scenes. While in the novel Dracula is something a curse creature, unforgiven, cursed by God, inhumane, heartless, deserves to die, and has a childish frame of mind. 2. In the novel there are no explanations about the Dracula having lovers or wives or whatever. So turning Mina into some kind of reincarnation of the passed Dracula lover is something ridiculous. And the film even worse makes the love relations between Dracula and Mina into the main topics is disgusting. 3. The novel shows the very deep modesty relation between Mina and Jonathan, they very loves each other, very respecting each other, they feel their emotions each other, they show their grieves deeply if one another has the problems, and it's affecting us...REALLY. But the film turns Mina into an unfaithful wife with her desire to the Dracula and they even almost make love in Mina's desire...MY GOSH!!!! SPOILER ENDS!! Finally, i understand if a film isn't exactly words by words with the novel version, but if they changed the main topic and the heart of the novel which is the beast Dracula in to something humane Dracula, thats too much. And turning the faithful and religious Mina into the unfaithful Mina in the film, thats just unthinkable. For the casual beholders and yet to read the book, it better to watch the film first then read the book so you wont be upset. Even better After watch the film and don;t do the reading, it will make you feel cheated. But for the beholders that have no desire to read the book, its the best for them, the film could be a fun thing. The pesky beholder (just like me) is the one that after read the book then watched the movie. Just sad thing.

    Francis Ford Coppola's daring screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula" starts with a bang. A bang which sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie. Often confusing and abstract "Bram Stoker's Dracula" is a complex puzzle of horror, love and other stuff. The film starts with a young Dracula renouncing God and stabbing a cross in a church; the cross presides to bleed, literally. Quickly the Church is flooded with blood and the young Dracula is transformed into the infamous prince of darkness. Now if that "bang" sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie then you know that you are in for one hell of a roller-coaster. For the full review, take a look at kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk

    Horror movie with element of high spiritual choice in the very beginning of the story. Main hero, a man with high level of spiritual consciousness and spiritual direction to God, is getting a test via his beloved wife's death. By accepting the loss the man could gain a spiritual strength and become closer to God. However, the man made the opposite choice- he complained of God. As a result of this opposition the main hero ( Dracula) lost his unique chance to gain an extra enlightenment and changed his direction toward the Dark forces. The devotion to the dark forces transformed the man to their servant, i. e. a vampire.

    'Dracula - Dead and Loving It' is a far superior film, because at least it is funny, while Coppola's film is not scary. The character of Dracula is poorly written, the romance is unpersuasive, and frankly the whole thing quickly gets very boring. I couldn't care less for the fate of the protagonists and I was alienated by the fact that instead of horror I was being served a love story straight out of a cheap women's novel. This film is pure kitsch, and it's not even entertaining kitsch. That's two strikes. The fact that good actors were wasted in this film is strike three. Coppola, you're out. I'll stick to classics like 'Nosferatu'.

    now, after reading the book and watching the movie for the third time i officially blame the director and screenwriter for the twilight movies as they made it a rule that all vampires must have some sort of stupid love interest. i don't know if Ford Coppola tried to do a parody of the book but he has certainly succeeded doing that. and although the book is bad the movie evidently is worse. i remember watching it as a kid and thinking that it was the coolest movie ever made. apparently i did not take in consideration the almost pornographic scenes, all the moaning and the breasts flying all over the place and especially the really bad acting. and although i did not like the book, it felt that Dracula was exactly how a film adaptation should not be made. just for commercial purpose.

    A young lawyer named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves, though Coppola has openly criticized his own reasoning for casting Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker ; according to him, he needed a young, hot star that would connect with the girls) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe . He is captured and imprisoned by a strange vampire and his bloodsucker girlfriends . He really is a 15th-century Romanian warrior who lives on through the ages and gone back life . Avenging the death of his beloved wife ; the undead vampire named Dracula (Gary Oldman , among those who auditioned for the part were Andy Garcia , Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas and Viggo Mortensen) comes to England to seduce a visitor's fianc&eacute;e (Winona Rider) and inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers , but these supernatural powers have sinister origins . Dracula starts a reign of seduction and horror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost) . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords (Gary Elwes , Bill Campbell , Keanu Reeves) acquiring the assistance of the Vampire expert Prof. Abraham Van Helsing 8anthony Hopkins) . Colorful version about the famous personage with an all-star cast , brilliant cinematography by Michael Balhaus , glamorous gowns and spectacular production design by Thomas Sanders , including evocative sights on Victorian London . And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in &uml;Mishima&uml; produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup. This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : "Bram Stoker's Count Dracula" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; &uml; Dracula&uml; (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , &uml;Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version &uml;Dracula&uml;2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .

It is annoying how some people are trying to compare it to the book who haven't read the book. Couldn't sound less illiterate! Please don't make reviews and say something like "I didn't read the book, but I thought this movie was great." Just base your judgment on the movie then and don't think you have an opinion to compare.

    I read the novel and finished it about one week and the next day i watched the movie. Well, i just want to say that if i watched the movie without read the novel first i would have given a better rating maybe 8. Its not a bad movie but very unfaithful and disrespect the novel. I am disappointed with this flicks because the title is the straightforward "BRAM STOKER'S Dracula". Bram himself should be regretting himself to wrote the good book and abused after his rest in the grave. ***SPOILER***WARNING!!! 1. The film clearly abused the novel with humanizing the Dracula, how the Dracula feels regret when turning Mina into vampire and all other scenes. While in the novel Dracula is something a curse creature, unforgiven, cursed by God, inhumane, heartless, deserves to die, and has a childish frame of mind. 2. In the novel there are no explanations about the Dracula having lovers or wives or whatever. So turning Mina into some kind of reincarnation of the passed Dracula lover is something ridiculous. And the film even worse makes the love relations between Dracula and Mina into the main topics is disgusting. 3. The novel shows the very deep modesty relation between Mina and Jonathan, they very loves each other, very respecting each other, they feel their emotions each other, they show their grieves deeply if one another has the problems, and it's affecting us...REALLY. But the film turns Mina into an unfaithful wife with her desire to the Dracula and they even almost make love in Mina's desire...MY GOSH!!!! SPOILER ENDS!! Finally, i understand if a film isn't exactly words by words with the novel version, but if they changed the main topic and the heart of the novel which is the beast Dracula in to something humane Dracula, thats too much. And turning the faithful and religious Mina into the unfaithful Mina in the film, thats just unthinkable. For the casual beholders and yet to read the book, it better to watch the film first then read the book so you wont be upset. Even better After watch the film and don;t do the reading, it will make you feel cheated. But for the beholders that have no desire to read the book, its the best for them, the film could be a fun thing. The pesky beholder (just like me) is the one that after read the book then watched the movie. Just sad thing.

    Francis Ford Coppola's daring screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula" starts with a bang. A bang which sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie. Often confusing and abstract "Bram Stoker's Dracula" is a complex puzzle of horror, love and other stuff. The film starts with a young Dracula renouncing God and stabbing a cross in a church; the cross presides to bleed, literally. Quickly the Church is flooded with blood and the young Dracula is transformed into the infamous prince of darkness. Now if that "bang" sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie then you know that you are in for one hell of a roller-coaster. For the full review, take a look at kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk

    Horror movie with element of high spiritual choice in the very beginning of the story. Main hero, a man with high level of spiritual consciousness and spiritual direction to God, is getting a test via his beloved wife's death. By accepting the loss the man could gain a spiritual strength and become closer to God. However, the man made the opposite choice- he complained of God. As a result of this opposition the main hero ( Dracula) lost his unique chance to gain an extra enlightenment and changed his direction toward the Dark forces. The devotion to the dark forces transformed the man to their servant, i. e. a vampire.

    'Dracula - Dead and Loving It' is a far superior film, because at least it is funny, while Coppola's film is not scary. The character of Dracula is poorly written, the romance is unpersuasive, and frankly the whole thing quickly gets very boring. I couldn't care less for the fate of the protagonists and I was alienated by the fact that instead of horror I was being served a love story straight out of a cheap women's novel. This film is pure kitsch, and it's not even entertaining kitsch. That's two strikes. The fact that good actors were wasted in this film is strike three. Coppola, you're out. I'll stick to classics like 'Nosferatu'.

    now, after reading the book and watching the movie for the third time i officially blame the director and screenwriter for the twilight movies as they made it a rule that all vampires must have some sort of stupid love interest. i don't know if Ford Coppola tried to do a parody of the book but he has certainly succeeded doing that. and although the book is bad the movie evidently is worse. i remember watching it as a kid and thinking that it was the coolest movie ever made. apparently i did not take in consideration the almost pornographic scenes, all the moaning and the breasts flying all over the place and especially the really bad acting. and although i did not like the book, it felt that Dracula was exactly how a film adaptation should not be made. just for commercial purpose.

    A young lawyer named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves, though Coppola has openly criticized his own reasoning for casting Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker ; according to him, he needed a young, hot star that would connect with the girls) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe . He is captured and imprisoned by a strange vampire and his bloodsucker girlfriends . He really is a 15th-century Romanian warrior who lives on through the ages and gone back life . Avenging the death of his beloved wife ; the undead vampire named Dracula (Gary Oldman , among those who auditioned for the part were Andy Garcia , Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas and Viggo Mortensen) comes to England to seduce a visitor's fianc&eacute;e (Winona Rider) and inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers , but these supernatural powers have sinister origins . Dracula starts a reign of seduction and horror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost) . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords (Gary Elwes , Bill Campbell , Keanu Reeves) acquiring the assistance of the Vampire expert Prof. Abraham Van Helsing 8anthony Hopkins) . Colorful version about the famous personage with an all-star cast , brilliant cinematography by Michael Balhaus , glamorous gowns and spectacular production design by Thomas Sanders , including evocative sights on Victorian London . And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in &uml;Mishima&uml; produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup. This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : "Bram Stoker's Count Dracula" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; &uml; Dracula&uml; (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , &uml;Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version &uml;Dracula&uml;2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .

    "Over the years all these vampire movies have come out and nobody looks like a vampire anymore." Johnny Depp Most of the time, vampires aren't my thing, although I loved "Interview With A Vampire," the movie and the book. Anne Rice does vampire. Johnny Depp ain't my thing, either, pretty much, although I confess that I've watched "Edward Scissorhands" repeatedly. And I guess pirates aren't my thing, pretty much, either.... But --- "...nobody looks like a vampire anymore"? That's deep truth. You want vampire? First, you have to read Dracula. Bram Stoker did vampire the right way. You want a white-knuckle "chase scene"? Try chasing Dracula by stagecoach through the mountains back to his castle in Transylvania.... Then you should watch "Nosferatu" (1922) if you want to do this thing right. Then you have to see the 1931 version of the "Dracula" movies. Then you have to put Bela Lugosi's poster picture on your wall. Keep looking at it. Then you can watch the 1992 "Dracula" with Gary Oldman. Put his poster on the wall. Stare at that one for a while. Now you're ready to talk vampire talk. Â…and by the way, I didn't like "Dark Shadows," there are lots of good reasons why the film never made it to the hit parade....for one thing, it doesn't have any Transylvanian stagecoaches, duh....

    I've been in love with the Dracula story for a long time now. Bela Lugosi as Dracula was just my cup of tea. Yes, it was a long time ago and the acting was more overdone than today, but I still loved it to my heart. And then I watched this. I love Gary Oldman, I adore Keanu Reeves, and I worship Anthony Hopkins. ALL of them were terrible in this movie. All. of. them! How is this even possible? And don't even let me start on Winona Ryder. I've really, really tried to like her since I saw her in Beetlejuice. But everything else she did just doesn't to it for me. I'm doing this as a review of the movie as a movie, not an adaptation of the book. The movie was really boring to watch. The curves of action and interesting stuff happening had not pattern what so ever. It looked very interesting in the trailer, especially when I heard Oldman's laughter as Dracula, but I was really disappointed. The acting. Oh god the acting. I don't know where to start. I really cringed and sat with a "what the deuce"-expression in my face during the Dracula's Brides-scene with Keanu Reeves being seduced by some horny naked vampires. I get it, vampires are sexy nowadays, especially the women. I get the seduction. But really? He only looked at them and BOOM he looked like he was getting the pleasure of his life. And when he overly dramatically said "Music!? Those ANIMALS!?", after Gary Oldman had said the famous "The children of the night! What music they make!"- line, and it sounded like he said it without having nostrils, I really couldn't take any of them seriously at all. Gary Oldman has a huge repertoire as an actor and it is just awesome! But what happened here Oldman? Where you drunk? Did you eat something that made your bowel movements go "oops"? Did you watch some kind of sad children's movie before you got on set? Because it sure looks like you did these things. Him as Dracula did just not work at all! I don't know what I should say about the accent, too thick for my taste. I have no idea what a Transylvanian accent sounds like, but I didn't like it this time. Anthony Hopkins didn't make it to me either. I love his action usually, but here something happened to him. He was fitting as a Van Helsing, he did it OK, but there was no real feeling to it. It felt like he was just thrown into the movie by Coppola, saying to him: "Could you just do this scene very quickly? Then you can go home". And Winona Ryder. Poor girl really can't act any more. There is this dead, boring aura around here that won't go away. It's like she knows there is a camera there and she wants to shine as the best actress you'll ever see. She wants to be Meryl Streep, but she is and stays Winona Ryder. No more. And I think the scene where she finds out that "her love" is Dracula and he killed Lucy. She cries for less than fifteen seconds. Then she clumsily, and very unromantically, says "I love you". And the "Take me away from all this death" line? Uhm, honey, you're talking to Dracula. He kills people every bloody night. You want to be a part of him forever? You're gonna have a bad time. And Sadie Frost: stop acting like you're in an adult movie. Getting bitten in the neck and being sick isn't pleasurable, like you make it sound. It is supposed to hurt, not give you pleasure spasms. And I can't even say how annoyed I was by some of the "special effects". The blood coming out from Dracula's "torso", his wrinkled face floating in the sky like in a badly made goth metal band's album cover, I could rant about so much more, but I have one thing I want to say did go well. The makeup. Dracula's form as a bat and an old man was actually pretty scary. Whoever did the makeup made Dracula look frightening and threatening, which I don't see too often. The same with Lucy's vampire makeup. Maybe a bit overdone (we're talking the whitest of the white faces you'll ever see), but scary. I just got annoyed by thinking of the poor child being so frightened of her that they had to really, really sweet talk with her to do the scene. But credits and stars to the makeup artists. Thumbs down and shaking of heads to the rest, especially you Coppola. You did great with the Godfather. Don't ever make vampire movies again, please.

    Some mind-bogglingly bad performances have been captured on film. Exhibit A: Al Pacino's laugh-out-loud performance in the notoriously overrated SCARFACE. "Who joo talking to...?" Exhibit B: Martin Landau's who-gives-a-f*** turn as Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD. Exhibit C: Nicole "You gotta be kiddin' me" Kidman in COLD MOUNTAIN (or whatever it was called). Exhibit D: EVERYBODY in DICK TRACY (ESPECIALLY Masdonna and Warren Beatty). Exhibit E: Jeff Bridges in the American remake of THE VANISHING. I could go on (and on and on; this's an EASY one, once you get started), but time's a'wastin'. I'm here to talk about Gary Oldman in "BRAM STOKER'S" Dracula. (Wynona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were TRYING, damn it, though Anthony Hopkins just phoned it in- again...) Oldman's mangling of whatever accents he was attempting is hilarious to watch: he may well have had a mouthful of marbles (it would explain a lot). The movie LOOKS great, but there are times when Looks just ain't enough. THIS is one of them times. Rewriting Stoker is never a good idea; filmmakers do so at their own peril. The "origin" story of Dracula, lifted from the black and white Dracula LIVES! Marvel Comics magazine, adds little to the film (well, it extends the running time, but that's about all). Next time around (and there WILL be a next time; you can count on it), maybe it'd be a good idea to just do it By The Book. And, while I'm at it, whoever's up next with an attempt at a theatrical version of Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND should get a copy of HIS script for same from Gauntlet Press; it sure as s*** couldn't hurt...

Johnny Depp Most of the time, vampires aren't my thing, although I loved "Interview With A Vampire," the movie and the book. Anne Rice does vampire. Johnny Depp ain't my thing, either, pretty much, although I confess that I've watched "Edward Scissorhands" repeatedly. And I guess pirates aren't my thing, pretty much, either.... But --- "...nobody looks like a vampire anymore"? That's deep truth. You want vampire? First, you have to read Dracula. Bram Stoker did vampire the right way. You want a white-knuckle "chase scene"? Try chasing Dracula by stagecoach through the mountains back to his castle in Transylvania.... Then you should watch "Nosferatu" (1922) if you want to do this thing right. Then you have to see the 1931 version of the "Dracula" movies. Then you have to put Bela Lugosi's poster picture on your wall. Keep looking at it. Then you can watch the 1992 "Dracula" with Gary Oldman. Put his poster on the wall. Stare at that one for a while. Now you're ready to talk vampire talk. Â…and by the way, I didn't like "Dark Shadows," there are lots of good reasons why the film never made it to the hit parade....for one thing, it doesn't have any Transylvanian stagecoaches, duh....

    I've been in love with the Dracula story for a long time now. Bela Lugosi as Dracula was just my cup of tea. Yes, it was a long time ago and the acting was more overdone than today, but I still loved it to my heart. And then I watched this. I love Gary Oldman, I adore Keanu Reeves, and I worship Anthony Hopkins. ALL of them were terrible in this movie. All. of. them! How is this even possible? And don't even let me start on Winona Ryder. I've really, really tried to like her since I saw her in Beetlejuice. But everything else she did just doesn't to it for me. I'm doing this as a review of the movie as a movie, not an adaptation of the book. The movie was really boring to watch. The curves of action and interesting stuff happening had not pattern what so ever. It looked very interesting in the trailer, especially when I heard Oldman's laughter as Dracula, but I was really disappointed. The acting. Oh god the acting. I don't know where to start. I really cringed and sat with a "what the deuce"-expression in my face during the Dracula's Brides-scene with Keanu Reeves being seduced by some horny naked vampires. I get it, vampires are sexy nowadays, especially the women. I get the seduction. But really? He only looked at them and BOOM he looked like he was getting the pleasure of his life. And when he overly dramatically said "Music!? Those ANIMALS!?", after Gary Oldman had said the famous "The children of the night! What music they make!"- line, and it sounded like he said it without having nostrils, I really couldn't take any of them seriously at all. Gary Oldman has a huge repertoire as an actor and it is just awesome! But what happened here Oldman? Where you drunk? Did you eat something that made your bowel movements go "oops"? Did you watch some kind of sad children's movie before you got on set? Because it sure looks like you did these things. Him as Dracula did just not work at all! I don't know what I should say about the accent, too thick for my taste. I have no idea what a Transylvanian accent sounds like, but I didn't like it this time. Anthony Hopkins didn't make it to me either. I love his action usually, but here something happened to him. He was fitting as a Van Helsing, he did it OK, but there was no real feeling to it. It felt like he was just thrown into the movie by Coppola, saying to him: "Could you just do this scene very quickly? Then you can go home". And Winona Ryder. Poor girl really can't act any more. There is this dead, boring aura around here that won't go away. It's like she knows there is a camera there and she wants to shine as the best actress you'll ever see. She wants to be Meryl Streep, but she is and stays Winona Ryder. No more. And I think the scene where she finds out that "her love" is Dracula and he killed Lucy. She cries for less than fifteen seconds. Then she clumsily, and very unromantically, says "I love you". And the "Take me away from all this death" line? Uhm, honey, you're talking to Dracula. He kills people every bloody night. You want to be a part of him forever? You're gonna have a bad time. And Sadie Frost: stop acting like you're in an adult movie. Getting bitten in the neck and being sick isn't pleasurable, like you make it sound. It is supposed to hurt, not give you pleasure spasms. And I can't even say how annoyed I was by some of the "special effects". The blood coming out from Dracula's "torso", his wrinkled face floating in the sky like in a badly made goth metal band's album cover, I could rant about so much more, but I have one thing I want to say did go well. The makeup. Dracula's form as a bat and an old man was actually pretty scary. Whoever did the makeup made Dracula look frightening and threatening, which I don't see too often. The same with Lucy's vampire makeup. Maybe a bit overdone (we're talking the whitest of the white faces you'll ever see), but scary. I just got annoyed by thinking of the poor child being so frightened of her that they had to really, really sweet talk with her to do the scene. But credits and stars to the makeup artists. Thumbs down and shaking of heads to the rest, especially you Coppola. You did great with the Godfather. Don't ever make vampire movies again, please.

    Some mind-bogglingly bad performances have been captured on film. Exhibit A: Al Pacino's laugh-out-loud performance in the notoriously overrated SCARFACE. "Who joo talking to...?" Exhibit B: Martin Landau's who-gives-a-f*** turn as Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD. Exhibit C: Nicole "You gotta be kiddin' me" Kidman in COLD MOUNTAIN (or whatever it was called). Exhibit D: EVERYBODY in DICK TRACY (ESPECIALLY Masdonna and Warren Beatty). Exhibit E: Jeff Bridges in the American remake of THE VANISHING. I could go on (and on and on; this's an EASY one, once you get started), but time's a'wastin'. I'm here to talk about Gary Oldman in "BRAM STOKER'S" Dracula. (Wynona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were TRYING, damn it, though Anthony Hopkins just phoned it in- again...) Oldman's mangling of whatever accents he was attempting is hilarious to watch: he may well have had a mouthful of marbles (it would explain a lot). The movie LOOKS great, but there are times when Looks just ain't enough. THIS is one of them times. Rewriting Stoker is never a good idea; filmmakers do so at their own peril. The "origin" story of Dracula, lifted from the black and white Dracula LIVES! Marvel Comics magazine, adds little to the film (well, it extends the running time, but that's about all). Next time around (and there WILL be a next time; you can count on it), maybe it'd be a good idea to just do it By The Book. And, while I'm at it, whoever's up next with an attempt at a theatrical version of Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND should get a copy of HIS script for same from Gauntlet Press; it sure as s*** couldn't hurt...

    If you haven't read the book then yes you may like this movie. However, I read the book and I was very disappointed. I know that most movies aren't EXACTLY like the book. But this movie added so much crap that it didn't follow the book very well. All of the people that keep calling this "Bram Stoker's Dracula" are idiots. This isn't his, it's Hollywood's. I am sure a lot of them didn't read the book. The book is long and a little old and I did get bored. However, I am sad to say I liked it a lot better than the movie. It is annoying how some people are trying to compare it to the book who haven't read the book. Couldn't sound less illiterate! Please don't make reviews and say something like "I didn't read the book, but I thought this movie was great." Just base your judgment on the movie then and don't think you have an opinion to compare.

    I read the novel and finished it about one week and the next day i watched the movie. Well, i just want to say that if i watched the movie without read the novel first i would have given a better rating maybe 8. Its not a bad movie but very unfaithful and disrespect the novel. I am disappointed with this flicks because the title is the straightforward "BRAM STOKER'S Dracula". Bram himself should be regretting himself to wrote the good book and abused after his rest in the grave. ***SPOILER***WARNING!!! 1. The film clearly abused the novel with humanizing the Dracula, how the Dracula feels regret when turning Mina into vampire and all other scenes. While in the novel Dracula is something a curse creature, unforgiven, cursed by God, inhumane, heartless, deserves to die, and has a childish frame of mind. 2. In the novel there are no explanations about the Dracula having lovers or wives or whatever. So turning Mina into some kind of reincarnation of the passed Dracula lover is something ridiculous. And the film even worse makes the love relations between Dracula and Mina into the main topics is disgusting. 3. The novel shows the very deep modesty relation between Mina and Jonathan, they very loves each other, very respecting each other, they feel their emotions each other, they show their grieves deeply if one another has the problems, and it's affecting us...REALLY. But the film turns Mina into an unfaithful wife with her desire to the Dracula and they even almost make love in Mina's desire...MY GOSH!!!! SPOILER ENDS!! Finally, i understand if a film isn't exactly words by words with the novel version, but if they changed the main topic and the heart of the novel which is the beast Dracula in to something humane Dracula, thats too much. And turning the faithful and religious Mina into the unfaithful Mina in the film, thats just unthinkable. For the casual beholders and yet to read the book, it better to watch the film first then read the book so you wont be upset. Even better After watch the film and don;t do the reading, it will make you feel cheated. But for the beholders that have no desire to read the book, its the best for them, the film could be a fun thing. The pesky beholder (just like me) is the one that after read the book then watched the movie. Just sad thing.

    Francis Ford Coppola's daring screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula" starts with a bang. A bang which sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie. Often confusing and abstract "Bram Stoker's Dracula" is a complex puzzle of horror, love and other stuff. The film starts with a young Dracula renouncing God and stabbing a cross in a church; the cross presides to bleed, literally. Quickly the Church is flooded with blood and the young Dracula is transformed into the infamous prince of darkness. Now if that "bang" sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie then you know that you are in for one hell of a roller-coaster. For the full review, take a look at kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk

    Horror movie with element of high spiritual choice in the very beginning of the story. Main hero, a man with high level of spiritual consciousness and spiritual direction to God, is getting a test via his beloved wife's death. By accepting the loss the man could gain a spiritual strength and become closer to God. However, the man made the opposite choice- he complained of God. As a result of this opposition the main hero ( Dracula) lost his unique chance to gain an extra enlightenment and changed his direction toward the Dark forces. The devotion to the dark forces transformed the man to their servant, i. e. a vampire.

    'Dracula - Dead and Loving It' is a far superior film, because at least it is funny, while Coppola's film is not scary. The character of Dracula is poorly written, the romance is unpersuasive, and frankly the whole thing quickly gets very boring. I couldn't care less for the fate of the protagonists and I was alienated by the fact that instead of horror I was being served a love story straight out of a cheap women's novel. This film is pure kitsch, and it's not even entertaining kitsch. That's two strikes. The fact that good actors were wasted in this film is strike three. Coppola, you're out. I'll stick to classics like 'Nosferatu'.

    now, after reading the book and watching the movie for the third time i officially blame the director and screenwriter for the twilight movies as they made it a rule that all vampires must have some sort of stupid love interest. i don't know if Ford Coppola tried to do a parody of the book but he has certainly succeeded doing that. and although the book is bad the movie evidently is worse. i remember watching it as a kid and thinking that it was the coolest movie ever made. apparently i did not take in consideration the almost pornographic scenes, all the moaning and the breasts flying all over the place and especially the really bad acting. and although i did not like the book, it felt that Dracula was exactly how a film adaptation should not be made. just for commercial purpose.

    A young lawyer named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves, though Coppola has openly criticized his own reasoning for casting Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker ; according to him, he needed a young, hot star that would connect with the girls) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe . He is captured and imprisoned by a strange vampire and his bloodsucker girlfriends . He really is a 15th-century Romanian warrior who lives on through the ages and gone back life . Avenging the death of his beloved wife ; the undead vampire named Dracula (Gary Oldman , among those who auditioned for the part were Andy Garcia , Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas and Viggo Mortensen) comes to England to seduce a visitor's fianc&eacute;e (Winona Rider) and inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers , but these supernatural powers have sinister origins . Dracula starts a reign of seduction and horror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost) . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords (Gary Elwes , Bill Campbell , Keanu Reeves) acquiring the assistance of the Vampire expert Prof. Abraham Van Helsing 8anthony Hopkins) . Colorful version about the famous personage with an all-star cast , brilliant cinematography by Michael Balhaus , glamorous gowns and spectacular production design by Thomas Sanders , including evocative sights on Victorian London . And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in &uml;Mishima&uml; produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup. This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : "Bram Stoker's Count Dracula" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; &uml; Dracula&uml; (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , &uml;Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version &uml;Dracula&uml;2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .

The pesky beholder (just like me) is the one that after read the book then watched the movie. Just sad thing.

    Francis Ford Coppola's daring screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula" starts with a bang. A bang which sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie. Often confusing and abstract "Bram Stoker's Dracula" is a complex puzzle of horror, love and other stuff. The film starts with a young Dracula renouncing God and stabbing a cross in a church; the cross presides to bleed, literally. Quickly the Church is flooded with blood and the young Dracula is transformed into the infamous prince of darkness. Now if that "bang" sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie then you know that you are in for one hell of a roller-coaster. For the full review, take a look at kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk

    Horror movie with element of high spiritual choice in the very beginning of the story. Main hero, a man with high level of spiritual consciousness and spiritual direction to God, is getting a test via his beloved wife's death. By accepting the loss the man could gain a spiritual strength and become closer to God. However, the man made the opposite choice- he complained of God. As a result of this opposition the main hero ( Dracula) lost his unique chance to gain an extra enlightenment and changed his direction toward the Dark forces. The devotion to the dark forces transformed the man to their servant, i. e. a vampire.

    'Dracula - Dead and Loving It' is a far superior film, because at least it is funny, while Coppola's film is not scary. The character of Dracula is poorly written, the romance is unpersuasive, and frankly the whole thing quickly gets very boring. I couldn't care less for the fate of the protagonists and I was alienated by the fact that instead of horror I was being served a love story straight out of a cheap women's novel. This film is pure kitsch, and it's not even entertaining kitsch. That's two strikes. The fact that good actors were wasted in this film is strike three. Coppola, you're out. I'll stick to classics like 'Nosferatu'.

    now, after reading the book and watching the movie for the third time i officially blame the director and screenwriter for the twilight movies as they made it a rule that all vampires must have some sort of stupid love interest. i don't know if Ford Coppola tried to do a parody of the book but he has certainly succeeded doing that. and although the book is bad the movie evidently is worse. i remember watching it as a kid and thinking that it was the coolest movie ever made. apparently i did not take in consideration the almost pornographic scenes, all the moaning and the breasts flying all over the place and especially the really bad acting. and although i did not like the book, it felt that Dracula was exactly how a film adaptation should not be made. just for commercial purpose.

    A young lawyer named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves, though Coppola has openly criticized his own reasoning for casting Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker ; according to him, he needed a young, hot star that would connect with the girls) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe . He is captured and imprisoned by a strange vampire and his bloodsucker girlfriends . He really is a 15th-century Romanian warrior who lives on through the ages and gone back life . Avenging the death of his beloved wife ; the undead vampire named Dracula (Gary Oldman , among those who auditioned for the part were Andy Garcia , Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas and Viggo Mortensen) comes to England to seduce a visitor's fianc&eacute;e (Winona Rider) and inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers , but these supernatural powers have sinister origins . Dracula starts a reign of seduction and horror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost) . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords (Gary Elwes , Bill Campbell , Keanu Reeves) acquiring the assistance of the Vampire expert Prof. Abraham Van Helsing 8anthony Hopkins) . Colorful version about the famous personage with an all-star cast , brilliant cinematography by Michael Balhaus , glamorous gowns and spectacular production design by Thomas Sanders , including evocative sights on Victorian London . And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in &uml;Mishima&uml; produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup. This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : "Bram Stoker's Count Dracula" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; &uml; Dracula&uml; (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , &uml;Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version &uml;Dracula&uml;2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .

    "Over the years all these vampire movies have come out and nobody looks like a vampire anymore." Johnny Depp Most of the time, vampires aren't my thing, although I loved "Interview With A Vampire," the movie and the book. Anne Rice does vampire. Johnny Depp ain't my thing, either, pretty much, although I confess that I've watched "Edward Scissorhands" repeatedly. And I guess pirates aren't my thing, pretty much, either.... But --- "...nobody looks like a vampire anymore"? That's deep truth. You want vampire? First, you have to read Dracula. Bram Stoker did vampire the right way. You want a white-knuckle "chase scene"? Try chasing Dracula by stagecoach through the mountains back to his castle in Transylvania.... Then you should watch "Nosferatu" (1922) if you want to do this thing right. Then you have to see the 1931 version of the "Dracula" movies. Then you have to put Bela Lugosi's poster picture on your wall. Keep looking at it. Then you can watch the 1992 "Dracula" with Gary Oldman. Put his poster on the wall. Stare at that one for a while. Now you're ready to talk vampire talk. Â…and by the way, I didn't like "Dark Shadows," there are lots of good reasons why the film never made it to the hit parade....for one thing, it doesn't have any Transylvanian stagecoaches, duh....

    I've been in love with the Dracula story for a long time now. Bela Lugosi as Dracula was just my cup of tea. Yes, it was a long time ago and the acting was more overdone than today, but I still loved it to my heart. And then I watched this. I love Gary Oldman, I adore Keanu Reeves, and I worship Anthony Hopkins. ALL of them were terrible in this movie. All. of. them! How is this even possible? And don't even let me start on Winona Ryder. I've really, really tried to like her since I saw her in Beetlejuice. But everything else she did just doesn't to it for me. I'm doing this as a review of the movie as a movie, not an adaptation of the book. The movie was really boring to watch. The curves of action and interesting stuff happening had not pattern what so ever. It looked very interesting in the trailer, especially when I heard Oldman's laughter as Dracula, but I was really disappointed. The acting. Oh god the acting. I don't know where to start. I really cringed and sat with a "what the deuce"-expression in my face during the Dracula's Brides-scene with Keanu Reeves being seduced by some horny naked vampires. I get it, vampires are sexy nowadays, especially the women. I get the seduction. But really? He only looked at them and BOOM he looked like he was getting the pleasure of his life. And when he overly dramatically said "Music!? Those ANIMALS!?", after Gary Oldman had said the famous "The children of the night! What music they make!"- line, and it sounded like he said it without having nostrils, I really couldn't take any of them seriously at all. Gary Oldman has a huge repertoire as an actor and it is just awesome! But what happened here Oldman? Where you drunk? Did you eat something that made your bowel movements go "oops"? Did you watch some kind of sad children's movie before you got on set? Because it sure looks like you did these things. Him as Dracula did just not work at all! I don't know what I should say about the accent, too thick for my taste. I have no idea what a Transylvanian accent sounds like, but I didn't like it this time. Anthony Hopkins didn't make it to me either. I love his action usually, but here something happened to him. He was fitting as a Van Helsing, he did it OK, but there was no real feeling to it. It felt like he was just thrown into the movie by Coppola, saying to him: "Could you just do this scene very quickly? Then you can go home". And Winona Ryder. Poor girl really can't act any more. There is this dead, boring aura around here that won't go away. It's like she knows there is a camera there and she wants to shine as the best actress you'll ever see. She wants to be Meryl Streep, but she is and stays Winona Ryder. No more. And I think the scene where she finds out that "her love" is Dracula and he killed Lucy. She cries for less than fifteen seconds. Then she clumsily, and very unromantically, says "I love you". And the "Take me away from all this death" line? Uhm, honey, you're talking to Dracula. He kills people every bloody night. You want to be a part of him forever? You're gonna have a bad time. And Sadie Frost: stop acting like you're in an adult movie. Getting bitten in the neck and being sick isn't pleasurable, like you make it sound. It is supposed to hurt, not give you pleasure spasms. And I can't even say how annoyed I was by some of the "special effects". The blood coming out from Dracula's "torso", his wrinkled face floating in the sky like in a badly made goth metal band's album cover, I could rant about so much more, but I have one thing I want to say did go well. The makeup. Dracula's form as a bat and an old man was actually pretty scary. Whoever did the makeup made Dracula look frightening and threatening, which I don't see too often. The same with Lucy's vampire makeup. Maybe a bit overdone (we're talking the whitest of the white faces you'll ever see), but scary. I just got annoyed by thinking of the poor child being so frightened of her that they had to really, really sweet talk with her to do the scene. But credits and stars to the makeup artists. Thumbs down and shaking of heads to the rest, especially you Coppola. You did great with the Godfather. Don't ever make vampire movies again, please.

    Some mind-bogglingly bad performances have been captured on film. Exhibit A: Al Pacino's laugh-out-loud performance in the notoriously overrated SCARFACE. "Who joo talking to...?" Exhibit B: Martin Landau's who-gives-a-f*** turn as Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD. Exhibit C: Nicole "You gotta be kiddin' me" Kidman in COLD MOUNTAIN (or whatever it was called). Exhibit D: EVERYBODY in DICK TRACY (ESPECIALLY Masdonna and Warren Beatty). Exhibit E: Jeff Bridges in the American remake of THE VANISHING. I could go on (and on and on; this's an EASY one, once you get started), but time's a'wastin'. I'm here to talk about Gary Oldman in "BRAM STOKER'S" Dracula. (Wynona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were TRYING, damn it, though Anthony Hopkins just phoned it in- again...) Oldman's mangling of whatever accents he was attempting is hilarious to watch: he may well have had a mouthful of marbles (it would explain a lot). The movie LOOKS great, but there are times when Looks just ain't enough. THIS is one of them times. Rewriting Stoker is never a good idea; filmmakers do so at their own peril. The "origin" story of Dracula, lifted from the black and white Dracula LIVES! Marvel Comics magazine, adds little to the film (well, it extends the running time, but that's about all). Next time around (and there WILL be a next time; you can count on it), maybe it'd be a good idea to just do it By The Book. And, while I'm at it, whoever's up next with an attempt at a theatrical version of Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND should get a copy of HIS script for same from Gauntlet Press; it sure as s*** couldn't hurt...

    If you haven't read the book then yes you may like this movie. However, I read the book and I was very disappointed. I know that most movies aren't EXACTLY like the book. But this movie added so much crap that it didn't follow the book very well. All of the people that keep calling this "Bram Stoker's Dracula" are idiots. This isn't his, it's Hollywood's. I am sure a lot of them didn't read the book. The book is long and a little old and I did get bored. However, I am sad to say I liked it a lot better than the movie. It is annoying how some people are trying to compare it to the book who haven't read the book. Couldn't sound less illiterate! Please don't make reviews and say something like "I didn't read the book, but I thought this movie was great." Just base your judgment on the movie then and don't think you have an opinion to compare.

    I read the novel and finished it about one week and the next day i watched the movie. Well, i just want to say that if i watched the movie without read the novel first i would have given a better rating maybe 8. Its not a bad movie but very unfaithful and disrespect the novel. I am disappointed with this flicks because the title is the straightforward "BRAM STOKER'S Dracula". Bram himself should be regretting himself to wrote the good book and abused after his rest in the grave. ***SPOILER***WARNING!!! 1. The film clearly abused the novel with humanizing the Dracula, how the Dracula feels regret when turning Mina into vampire and all other scenes. While in the novel Dracula is something a curse creature, unforgiven, cursed by God, inhumane, heartless, deserves to die, and has a childish frame of mind. 2. In the novel there are no explanations about the Dracula having lovers or wives or whatever. So turning Mina into some kind of reincarnation of the passed Dracula lover is something ridiculous. And the film even worse makes the love relations between Dracula and Mina into the main topics is disgusting. 3. The novel shows the very deep modesty relation between Mina and Jonathan, they very loves each other, very respecting each other, they feel their emotions each other, they show their grieves deeply if one another has the problems, and it's affecting us...REALLY. But the film turns Mina into an unfaithful wife with her desire to the Dracula and they even almost make love in Mina's desire...MY GOSH!!!! SPOILER ENDS!! Finally, i understand if a film isn't exactly words by words with the novel version, but if they changed the main topic and the heart of the novel which is the beast Dracula in to something humane Dracula, thats too much. And turning the faithful and religious Mina into the unfaithful Mina in the film, thats just unthinkable. For the casual beholders and yet to read the book, it better to watch the film first then read the book so you wont be upset. Even better After watch the film and don;t do the reading, it will make you feel cheated. But for the beholders that have no desire to read the book, its the best for them, the film could be a fun thing. The pesky beholder (just like me) is the one that after read the book then watched the movie. Just sad thing.

I get it, vampires are sexy nowadays, especially the women. I get the seduction. But really? He only looked at them and BOOM he looked like he was getting the pleasure of his life. And when he overly dramatically said "Music!? Those ANIMALS!?", after Gary Oldman had said the famous "The children of the night! What music they make!"- line, and it sounded like he said it without having nostrils, I really couldn't take any of them seriously at all. Gary Oldman has a huge repertoire as an actor and it is just awesome! But what happened here Oldman? Where you drunk? Did you eat something that made your bowel movements go "oops"? Did you watch some kind of sad children's movie before you got on set? Because it sure looks like you did these things. Him as Dracula did just not work at all! I don't know what I should say about the accent, too thick for my taste. I have no idea what a Transylvanian accent sounds like, but I didn't like it this time. Anthony Hopkins didn't make it to me either. I love his action usually, but here something happened to him. He was fitting as a Van Helsing, he did it OK, but there was no real feeling to it. It felt like he was just thrown into the movie by Coppola, saying to him: "Could you just do this scene very quickly? Then you can go home". And Winona Ryder. Poor girl really can't act any more. There is this dead, boring aura around here that won't go away. It's like she knows there is a camera there and she wants to shine as the best actress you'll ever see. She wants to be Meryl Streep, but she is and stays Winona Ryder. No more. And I think the scene where she finds out that "her love" is Dracula and he killed Lucy. She cries for less than fifteen seconds. Then she clumsily, and very unromantically, says "I love you". And the "Take me away from all this death" line? Uhm, honey, you're talking to Dracula. He kills people every bloody night. You want to be a part of him forever? You're gonna have a bad time. And Sadie Frost: stop acting like you're in an adult movie. Getting bitten in the neck and being sick isn't pleasurable, like you make it sound. It is supposed to hurt, not give you pleasure spasms. And I can't even say how annoyed I was by some of the "special effects". The blood coming out from Dracula's "torso", his wrinkled face floating in the sky like in a badly made goth metal band's album cover, I could rant about so much more, but I have one thing I want to say did go well. The makeup. Dracula's form as a bat and an old man was actually pretty scary. Whoever did the makeup made Dracula look frightening and threatening, which I don't see too often. The same with Lucy's vampire makeup. Maybe a bit overdone (we're talking the whitest of the white faces you'll ever see), but scary. I just got annoyed by thinking of the poor child being so frightened of her that they had to really, really sweet talk with her to do the scene. But credits and stars to the makeup artists. Thumbs down and shaking of heads to the rest, especially you Coppola. You did great with the Godfather. Don't ever make vampire movies again, please.

    Some mind-bogglingly bad performances have been captured on film. Exhibit A: Al Pacino's laugh-out-loud performance in the notoriously overrated SCARFACE. "Who joo talking to...?" Exhibit B: Martin Landau's who-gives-a-f*** turn as Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD. Exhibit C: Nicole "You gotta be kiddin' me" Kidman in COLD MOUNTAIN (or whatever it was called). Exhibit D: EVERYBODY in DICK TRACY (ESPECIALLY Masdonna and Warren Beatty). Exhibit E: Jeff Bridges in the American remake of THE VANISHING. I could go on (and on and on; this's an EASY one, once you get started), but time's a'wastin'. I'm here to talk about Gary Oldman in "BRAM STOKER'S" Dracula. (Wynona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were TRYING, damn it, though Anthony Hopkins just phoned it in- again...) Oldman's mangling of whatever accents he was attempting is hilarious to watch: he may well have had a mouthful of marbles (it would explain a lot). The movie LOOKS great, but there are times when Looks just ain't enough. THIS is one of them times. Rewriting Stoker is never a good idea; filmmakers do so at their own peril. The "origin" story of Dracula, lifted from the black and white Dracula LIVES! Marvel Comics magazine, adds little to the film (well, it extends the running time, but that's about all). Next time around (and there WILL be a next time; you can count on it), maybe it'd be a good idea to just do it By The Book. And, while I'm at it, whoever's up next with an attempt at a theatrical version of Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND should get a copy of HIS script for same from Gauntlet Press; it sure as s*** couldn't hurt...

    If you haven't read the book then yes you may like this movie. However, I read the book and I was very disappointed. I know that most movies aren't EXACTLY like the book. But this movie added so much crap that it didn't follow the book very well. All of the people that keep calling this "Bram Stoker's Dracula" are idiots. This isn't his, it's Hollywood's. I am sure a lot of them didn't read the book. The book is long and a little old and I did get bored. However, I am sad to say I liked it a lot better than the movie. It is annoying how some people are trying to compare it to the book who haven't read the book. Couldn't sound less illiterate! Please don't make reviews and say something like "I didn't read the book, but I thought this movie was great." Just base your judgment on the movie then and don't think you have an opinion to compare.

    I read the novel and finished it about one week and the next day i watched the movie. Well, i just want to say that if i watched the movie without read the novel first i would have given a better rating maybe 8. Its not a bad movie but very unfaithful and disrespect the novel. I am disappointed with this flicks because the title is the straightforward "BRAM STOKER'S Dracula". Bram himself should be regretting himself to wrote the good book and abused after his rest in the grave. ***SPOILER***WARNING!!! 1. The film clearly abused the novel with humanizing the Dracula, how the Dracula feels regret when turning Mina into vampire and all other scenes. While in the novel Dracula is something a curse creature, unforgiven, cursed by God, inhumane, heartless, deserves to die, and has a childish frame of mind. 2. In the novel there are no explanations about the Dracula having lovers or wives or whatever. So turning Mina into some kind of reincarnation of the passed Dracula lover is something ridiculous. And the film even worse makes the love relations between Dracula and Mina into the main topics is disgusting. 3. The novel shows the very deep modesty relation between Mina and Jonathan, they very loves each other, very respecting each other, they feel their emotions each other, they show their grieves deeply if one another has the problems, and it's affecting us...REALLY. But the film turns Mina into an unfaithful wife with her desire to the Dracula and they even almost make love in Mina's desire...MY GOSH!!!! SPOILER ENDS!! Finally, i understand if a film isn't exactly words by words with the novel version, but if they changed the main topic and the heart of the novel which is the beast Dracula in to something humane Dracula, thats too much. And turning the faithful and religious Mina into the unfaithful Mina in the film, thats just unthinkable. For the casual beholders and yet to read the book, it better to watch the film first then read the book so you wont be upset. Even better After watch the film and don;t do the reading, it will make you feel cheated. But for the beholders that have no desire to read the book, its the best for them, the film could be a fun thing. The pesky beholder (just like me) is the one that after read the book then watched the movie. Just sad thing.

    Francis Ford Coppola's daring screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula" starts with a bang. A bang which sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie. Often confusing and abstract "Bram Stoker's Dracula" is a complex puzzle of horror, love and other stuff. The film starts with a young Dracula renouncing God and stabbing a cross in a church; the cross presides to bleed, literally. Quickly the Church is flooded with blood and the young Dracula is transformed into the infamous prince of darkness. Now if that "bang" sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie then you know that you are in for one hell of a roller-coaster. For the full review, take a look at kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk

    Horror movie with element of high spiritual choice in the very beginning of the story. Main hero, a man with high level of spiritual consciousness and spiritual direction to God, is getting a test via his beloved wife's death. By accepting the loss the man could gain a spiritual strength and become closer to God. However, the man made the opposite choice- he complained of God. As a result of this opposition the main hero ( Dracula) lost his unique chance to gain an extra enlightenment and changed his direction toward the Dark forces. The devotion to the dark forces transformed the man to their servant, i. e. a vampire.

    'Dracula - Dead and Loving It' is a far superior film, because at least it is funny, while Coppola's film is not scary. The character of Dracula is poorly written, the romance is unpersuasive, and frankly the whole thing quickly gets very boring. I couldn't care less for the fate of the protagonists and I was alienated by the fact that instead of horror I was being served a love story straight out of a cheap women's novel. This film is pure kitsch, and it's not even entertaining kitsch. That's two strikes. The fact that good actors were wasted in this film is strike three. Coppola, you're out. I'll stick to classics like 'Nosferatu'.

    now, after reading the book and watching the movie for the third time i officially blame the director and screenwriter for the twilight movies as they made it a rule that all vampires must have some sort of stupid love interest. i don't know if Ford Coppola tried to do a parody of the book but he has certainly succeeded doing that. and although the book is bad the movie evidently is worse. i remember watching it as a kid and thinking that it was the coolest movie ever made. apparently i did not take in consideration the almost pornographic scenes, all the moaning and the breasts flying all over the place and especially the really bad acting. and although i did not like the book, it felt that Dracula was exactly how a film adaptation should not be made. just for commercial purpose.

    A young lawyer named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves, though Coppola has openly criticized his own reasoning for casting Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker ; according to him, he needed a young, hot star that would connect with the girls) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe . He is captured and imprisoned by a strange vampire and his bloodsucker girlfriends . He really is a 15th-century Romanian warrior who lives on through the ages and gone back life . Avenging the death of his beloved wife ; the undead vampire named Dracula (Gary Oldman , among those who auditioned for the part were Andy Garcia , Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas and Viggo Mortensen) comes to England to seduce a visitor's fianc&eacute;e (Winona Rider) and inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers , but these supernatural powers have sinister origins . Dracula starts a reign of seduction and horror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost) . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords (Gary Elwes , Bill Campbell , Keanu Reeves) acquiring the assistance of the Vampire expert Prof. Abraham Van Helsing 8anthony Hopkins) . Colorful version about the famous personage with an all-star cast , brilliant cinematography by Michael Balhaus , glamorous gowns and spectacular production design by Thomas Sanders , including evocative sights on Victorian London . And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in &uml;Mishima&uml; produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup. This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : "Bram Stoker's Count Dracula" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; &uml; Dracula&uml; (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , &uml;Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version &uml;Dracula&uml;2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .

    "Over the years all these vampire movies have come out and nobody looks like a vampire anymore." Johnny Depp Most of the time, vampires aren't my thing, although I loved "Interview With A Vampire," the movie and the book. Anne Rice does vampire. Johnny Depp ain't my thing, either, pretty much, although I confess that I've watched "Edward Scissorhands" repeatedly. And I guess pirates aren't my thing, pretty much, either.... But --- "...nobody looks like a vampire anymore"? That's deep truth. You want vampire? First, you have to read Dracula. Bram Stoker did vampire the right way. You want a white-knuckle "chase scene"? Try chasing Dracula by stagecoach through the mountains back to his castle in Transylvania.... Then you should watch "Nosferatu" (1922) if you want to do this thing right. Then you have to see the 1931 version of the "Dracula" movies. Then you have to put Bela Lugosi's poster picture on your wall. Keep looking at it. Then you can watch the 1992 "Dracula" with Gary Oldman. Put his poster on the wall. Stare at that one for a while. Now you're ready to talk vampire talk. Â…and by the way, I didn't like "Dark Shadows," there are lots of good reasons why the film never made it to the hit parade....for one thing, it doesn't have any Transylvanian stagecoaches, duh....

    I've been in love with the Dracula story for a long time now. Bela Lugosi as Dracula was just my cup of tea. Yes, it was a long time ago and the acting was more overdone than today, but I still loved it to my heart. And then I watched this. I love Gary Oldman, I adore Keanu Reeves, and I worship Anthony Hopkins. ALL of them were terrible in this movie. All. of. them! How is this even possible? And don't even let me start on Winona Ryder. I've really, really tried to like her since I saw her in Beetlejuice. But everything else she did just doesn't to it for me. I'm doing this as a review of the movie as a movie, not an adaptation of the book. The movie was really boring to watch. The curves of action and interesting stuff happening had not pattern what so ever. It looked very interesting in the trailer, especially when I heard Oldman's laughter as Dracula, but I was really disappointed. The acting. Oh god the acting. I don't know where to start. I really cringed and sat with a "what the deuce"-expression in my face during the Dracula's Brides-scene with Keanu Reeves being seduced by some horny naked vampires.

    'Dracula - Dead and Loving It' is a far superior film, because at least it is funny, while Coppola's film is not scary. The character of Dracula is poorly written, the romance is unpersuasive, and frankly the whole thing quickly gets very boring. I couldn't care less for the fate of the protagonists and I was alienated by the fact that instead of horror I was being served a love story straight out of a cheap women's novel. This film is pure kitsch, and it's not even entertaining kitsch. That's two strikes. The fact that good actors were wasted in this film is strike three. Coppola, you're out. I'll stick to classics like 'Nosferatu'.

    now, after reading the book and watching the movie for the third time i officially blame the director and screenwriter for the twilight movies as they made it a rule that all vampires must have some sort of stupid love interest. i don't know if Ford Coppola tried to do a parody of the book but he has certainly succeeded doing that. and although the book is bad the movie evidently is worse. i remember watching it as a kid and thinking that it was the coolest movie ever made. apparently i did not take in consideration the almost pornographic scenes, all the moaning and the breasts flying all over the place and especially the really bad acting. and although i did not like the book, it felt that Dracula was exactly how a film adaptation should not be made. just for commercial purpose.

    A young lawyer named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves, though Coppola has openly criticized his own reasoning for casting Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker ; according to him, he needed a young, hot star that would connect with the girls) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe . He is captured and imprisoned by a strange vampire and his bloodsucker girlfriends . He really is a 15th-century Romanian warrior who lives on through the ages and gone back life . Avenging the death of his beloved wife ; the undead vampire named Dracula (Gary Oldman , among those who auditioned for the part were Andy Garcia , Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas and Viggo Mortensen) comes to England to seduce a visitor's fianc&eacute;e (Winona Rider) and inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers , but these supernatural powers have sinister origins . Dracula starts a reign of seduction and horror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost) . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords (Gary Elwes , Bill Campbell , Keanu Reeves) acquiring the assistance of the Vampire expert Prof. Abraham Van Helsing 8anthony Hopkins) . Colorful version about the famous personage with an all-star cast , brilliant cinematography by Michael Balhaus , glamorous gowns and spectacular production design by Thomas Sanders , including evocative sights on Victorian London . And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in &uml;Mishima&uml; produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup. This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : "Bram Stoker's Count Dracula" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; &uml; Dracula&uml; (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , &uml;Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version &uml;Dracula&uml;2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .

    "Over the years all these vampire movies have come out and nobody looks like a vampire anymore." Johnny Depp Most of the time, vampires aren't my thing, although I loved "Interview With A Vampire," the movie and the book. Anne Rice does vampire. Johnny Depp ain't my thing, either, pretty much, although I confess that I've watched "Edward Scissorhands" repeatedly. And I guess pirates aren't my thing, pretty much, either.... But --- "...nobody looks like a vampire anymore"? That's deep truth. You want vampire? First, you have to read Dracula. Bram Stoker did vampire the right way. You want a white-knuckle "chase scene"? Try chasing Dracula by stagecoach through the mountains back to his castle in Transylvania.... Then you should watch "Nosferatu" (1922) if you want to do this thing right. Then you have to see the 1931 version of the "Dracula" movies. Then you have to put Bela Lugosi's poster picture on your wall. Keep looking at it. Then you can watch the 1992 "Dracula" with Gary Oldman. Put his poster on the wall. Stare at that one for a while. Now you're ready to talk vampire talk. Â…and by the way, I didn't like "Dark Shadows," there are lots of good reasons why the film never made it to the hit parade....for one thing, it doesn't have any Transylvanian stagecoaches, duh....

    I've been in love with the Dracula story for a long time now. Bela Lugosi as Dracula was just my cup of tea. Yes, it was a long time ago and the acting was more overdone than today, but I still loved it to my heart. And then I watched this. I love Gary Oldman, I adore Keanu Reeves, and I worship Anthony Hopkins. ALL of them were terrible in this movie. All. of. them! How is this even possible? And don't even let me start on Winona Ryder. I've really, really tried to like her since I saw her in Beetlejuice. But everything else she did just doesn't to it for me. I'm doing this as a review of the movie as a movie, not an adaptation of the book. The movie was really boring to watch. The curves of action and interesting stuff happening had not pattern what so ever. It looked very interesting in the trailer, especially when I heard Oldman's laughter as Dracula, but I was really disappointed. The acting. Oh god the acting. I don't know where to start. I really cringed and sat with a "what the deuce"-expression in my face during the Dracula's Brides-scene with Keanu Reeves being seduced by some horny naked vampires. I get it, vampires are sexy nowadays, especially the women. I get the seduction. But really? He only looked at them and BOOM he looked like he was getting the pleasure of his life. And when he overly dramatically said "Music!? Those ANIMALS!?", after Gary Oldman had said the famous "The children of the night! What music they make!"- line, and it sounded like he said it without having nostrils, I really couldn't take any of them seriously at all. Gary Oldman has a huge repertoire as an actor and it is just awesome! But what happened here Oldman? Where you drunk? Did you eat something that made your bowel movements go "oops"? Did you watch some kind of sad children's movie before you got on set? Because it sure looks like you did these things. Him as Dracula did just not work at all! I don't know what I should say about the accent, too thick for my taste. I have no idea what a Transylvanian accent sounds like, but I didn't like it this time. Anthony Hopkins didn't make it to me either. I love his action usually, but here something happened to him. He was fitting as a Van Helsing, he did it OK, but there was no real feeling to it. It felt like he was just thrown into the movie by Coppola, saying to him: "Could you just do this scene very quickly? Then you can go home". And Winona Ryder. Poor girl really can't act any more. There is this dead, boring aura around here that won't go away. It's like she knows there is a camera there and she wants to shine as the best actress you'll ever see. She wants to be Meryl Streep, but she is and stays Winona Ryder. No more. And I think the scene where she finds out that "her love" is Dracula and he killed Lucy. She cries for less than fifteen seconds. Then she clumsily, and very unromantically, says "I love you". And the "Take me away from all this death" line? Uhm, honey, you're talking to Dracula. He kills people every bloody night. You want to be a part of him forever? You're gonna have a bad time. And Sadie Frost: stop acting like you're in an adult movie. Getting bitten in the neck and being sick isn't pleasurable, like you make it sound. It is supposed to hurt, not give you pleasure spasms. And I can't even say how annoyed I was by some of the "special effects". The blood coming out from Dracula's "torso", his wrinkled face floating in the sky like in a badly made goth metal band's album cover, I could rant about so much more, but I have one thing I want to say did go well. The makeup. Dracula's form as a bat and an old man was actually pretty scary. Whoever did the makeup made Dracula look frightening and threatening, which I don't see too often. The same with Lucy's vampire makeup. Maybe a bit overdone (we're talking the whitest of the white faces you'll ever see), but scary. I just got annoyed by thinking of the poor child being so frightened of her that they had to really, really sweet talk with her to do the scene. But credits and stars to the makeup artists. Thumbs down and shaking of heads to the rest, especially you Coppola. You did great with the Godfather. Don't ever make vampire movies again, please.

    Some mind-bogglingly bad performances have been captured on film. Exhibit A: Al Pacino's laugh-out-loud performance in the notoriously overrated SCARFACE. "Who joo talking to...?" Exhibit B: Martin Landau's who-gives-a-f*** turn as Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD. Exhibit C: Nicole "You gotta be kiddin' me" Kidman in COLD MOUNTAIN (or whatever it was called). Exhibit D: EVERYBODY in DICK TRACY (ESPECIALLY Masdonna and Warren Beatty). Exhibit E: Jeff Bridges in the American remake of THE VANISHING. I could go on (and on and on; this's an EASY one, once you get started), but time's a'wastin'. I'm here to talk about Gary Oldman in "BRAM STOKER'S" Dracula. (Wynona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were TRYING, damn it, though Anthony Hopkins just phoned it in- again...) Oldman's mangling of whatever accents he was attempting is hilarious to watch: he may well have had a mouthful of marbles (it would explain a lot). The movie LOOKS great, but there are times when Looks just ain't enough. THIS is one of them times. Rewriting Stoker is never a good idea; filmmakers do so at their own peril. The "origin" story of Dracula, lifted from the black and white Dracula LIVES! Marvel Comics magazine, adds little to the film (well, it extends the running time, but that's about all). Next time around (and there WILL be a next time; you can count on it), maybe it'd be a good idea to just do it By The Book. And, while I'm at it, whoever's up next with an attempt at a theatrical version of Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND should get a copy of HIS script for same from Gauntlet Press; it sure as s*** couldn't hurt...

    If you haven't read the book then yes you may like this movie. However, I read the book and I was very disappointed. I know that most movies aren't EXACTLY like the book. But this movie added so much crap that it didn't follow the book very well. All of the people that keep calling this "Bram Stoker's Dracula" are idiots. This isn't his, it's Hollywood's. I am sure a lot of them didn't read the book. The book is long and a little old and I did get bored. However, I am sad to say I liked it a lot better than the movie. It is annoying how some people are trying to compare it to the book who haven't read the book. Couldn't sound less illiterate! Please don't make reviews and say something like "I didn't read the book, but I thought this movie was great." Just base your judgment on the movie then and don't think you have an opinion to compare.

    I read the novel and finished it about one week and the next day i watched the movie. Well, i just want to say that if i watched the movie without read the novel first i would have given a better rating maybe 8. Its not a bad movie but very unfaithful and disrespect the novel. I am disappointed with this flicks because the title is the straightforward "BRAM STOKER'S Dracula". Bram himself should be regretting himself to wrote the good book and abused after his rest in the grave. ***SPOILER***WARNING!!! 1. The film clearly abused the novel with humanizing the Dracula, how the Dracula feels regret when turning Mina into vampire and all other scenes. While in the novel Dracula is something a curse creature, unforgiven, cursed by God, inhumane, heartless, deserves to die, and has a childish frame of mind. 2. In the novel there are no explanations about the Dracula having lovers or wives or whatever. So turning Mina into some kind of reincarnation of the passed Dracula lover is something ridiculous. And the film even worse makes the love relations between Dracula and Mina into the main topics is disgusting. 3. The novel shows the very deep modesty relation between Mina and Jonathan, they very loves each other, very respecting each other, they feel their emotions each other, they show their grieves deeply if one another has the problems, and it's affecting us...REALLY. But the film turns Mina into an unfaithful wife with her desire to the Dracula and they even almost make love in Mina's desire...MY GOSH!!!! SPOILER ENDS!! Finally, i understand if a film isn't exactly words by words with the novel version, but if they changed the main topic and the heart of the novel which is the beast Dracula in to something humane Dracula, thats too much. And turning the faithful and religious Mina into the unfaithful Mina in the film, thats just unthinkable. For the casual beholders and yet to read the book, it better to watch the film first then read the book so you wont be upset. Even better After watch the film and don;t do the reading, it will make you feel cheated. But for the beholders that have no desire to read the book, its the best for them, the film could be a fun thing. The pesky beholder (just like me) is the one that after read the book then watched the movie. Just sad thing.

    Francis Ford Coppola's daring screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula" starts with a bang. A bang which sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie. Often confusing and abstract "Bram Stoker's Dracula" is a complex puzzle of horror, love and other stuff. The film starts with a young Dracula renouncing God and stabbing a cross in a church; the cross presides to bleed, literally. Quickly the Church is flooded with blood and the young Dracula is transformed into the infamous prince of darkness. Now if that "bang" sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie then you know that you are in for one hell of a roller-coaster. For the full review, take a look at kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk

    Horror movie with element of high spiritual choice in the very beginning of the story. Main hero, a man with high level of spiritual consciousness and spiritual direction to God, is getting a test via his beloved wife's death. By accepting the loss the man could gain a spiritual strength and become closer to God. However, the man made the opposite choice- he complained of God. As a result of this opposition the main hero ( Dracula) lost his unique chance to gain an extra enlightenment and changed his direction toward the Dark forces. The devotion to the dark forces transformed the man to their servant, i. e. a vampire.

I just got annoyed by thinking of the poor child being so frightened of her that they had to really, really sweet talk with her to do the scene. But credits and stars to the makeup artists. Thumbs down and shaking of heads to the rest, especially you Coppola. You did great with the Godfather. Don't ever make vampire movies again, please.

    Some mind-bogglingly bad performances have been captured on film. Exhibit A: Al Pacino's laugh-out-loud performance in the notoriously overrated SCARFACE. "Who joo talking to...?" Exhibit B: Martin Landau's who-gives-a-f*** turn as Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD. Exhibit C: Nicole "You gotta be kiddin' me" Kidman in COLD MOUNTAIN (or whatever it was called). Exhibit D: EVERYBODY in DICK TRACY (ESPECIALLY Masdonna and Warren Beatty). Exhibit E: Jeff Bridges in the American remake of THE VANISHING. I could go on (and on and on; this's an EASY one, once you get started), but time's a'wastin'. I'm here to talk about Gary Oldman in "BRAM STOKER'S" Dracula. (Wynona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were TRYING, damn it, though Anthony Hopkins just phoned it in- again...) Oldman's mangling of whatever accents he was attempting is hilarious to watch: he may well have had a mouthful of marbles (it would explain a lot). The movie LOOKS great, but there are times when Looks just ain't enough. THIS is one of them times. Rewriting Stoker is never a good idea; filmmakers do so at their own peril. The "origin" story of Dracula, lifted from the black and white Dracula LIVES! Marvel Comics magazine, adds little to the film (well, it extends the running time, but that's about all). Next time around (and there WILL be a next time; you can count on it), maybe it'd be a good idea to just do it By The Book. And, while I'm at it, whoever's up next with an attempt at a theatrical version of Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND should get a copy of HIS script for same from Gauntlet Press; it sure as s*** couldn't hurt...

    If you haven't read the book then yes you may like this movie. However, I read the book and I was very disappointed. I know that most movies aren't EXACTLY like the book. But this movie added so much crap that it didn't follow the book very well. All of the people that keep calling this "Bram Stoker's Dracula" are idiots. This isn't his, it's Hollywood's. I am sure a lot of them didn't read the book. The book is long and a little old and I did get bored. However, I am sad to say I liked it a lot better than the movie. It is annoying how some people are trying to compare it to the book who haven't read the book. Couldn't sound less illiterate! Please don't make reviews and say something like "I didn't read the book, but I thought this movie was great." Just base your judgment on the movie then and don't think you have an opinion to compare.

    I read the novel and finished it about one week and the next day i watched the movie. Well, i just want to say that if i watched the movie without read the novel first i would have given a better rating maybe 8. Its not a bad movie but very unfaithful and disrespect the novel. I am disappointed with this flicks because the title is the straightforward "BRAM STOKER'S Dracula". Bram himself should be regretting himself to wrote the good book and abused after his rest in the grave. ***SPOILER***WARNING!!! 1. The film clearly abused the novel with humanizing the Dracula, how the Dracula feels regret when turning Mina into vampire and all other scenes. While in the novel Dracula is something a curse creature, unforgiven, cursed by God, inhumane, heartless, deserves to die, and has a childish frame of mind. 2. In the novel there are no explanations about the Dracula having lovers or wives or whatever. So turning Mina into some kind of reincarnation of the passed Dracula lover is something ridiculous. And the film even worse makes the love relations between Dracula and Mina into the main topics is disgusting. 3. The novel shows the very deep modesty relation between Mina and Jonathan, they very loves each other, very respecting each other, they feel their emotions each other, they show their grieves deeply if one another has the problems, and it's affecting us...REALLY. But the film turns Mina into an unfaithful wife with her desire to the Dracula and they even almost make love in Mina's desire...MY GOSH!!!! SPOILER ENDS!! Finally, i understand if a film isn't exactly words by words with the novel version, but if they changed the main topic and the heart of the novel which is the beast Dracula in to something humane Dracula, thats too much. And turning the faithful and religious Mina into the unfaithful Mina in the film, thats just unthinkable. For the casual beholders and yet to read the book, it better to watch the film first then read the book so you wont be upset. Even better After watch the film and don;t do the reading, it will make you feel cheated. But for the beholders that have no desire to read the book, its the best for them, the film could be a fun thing. The pesky beholder (just like me) is the one that after read the book then watched the movie. Just sad thing.

    Francis Ford Coppola's daring screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula" starts with a bang. A bang which sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie. Often confusing and abstract "Bram Stoker's Dracula" is a complex puzzle of horror, love and other stuff. The film starts with a young Dracula renouncing God and stabbing a cross in a church; the cross presides to bleed, literally. Quickly the Church is flooded with blood and the young Dracula is transformed into the infamous prince of darkness. Now if that "bang" sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie then you know that you are in for one hell of a roller-coaster. For the full review, take a look at kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk

    Horror movie with element of high spiritual choice in the very beginning of the story. Main hero, a man with high level of spiritual consciousness and spiritual direction to God, is getting a test via his beloved wife's death. By accepting the loss the man could gain a spiritual strength and become closer to God. However, the man made the opposite choice- he complained of God. As a result of this opposition the main hero ( Dracula) lost his unique chance to gain an extra enlightenment and changed his direction toward the Dark forces. The devotion to the dark forces transformed the man to their servant, i. e. a vampire.

    'Dracula - Dead and Loving It' is a far superior film, because at least it is funny, while Coppola's film is not scary. The character of Dracula is poorly written, the romance is unpersuasive, and frankly the whole thing quickly gets very boring. I couldn't care less for the fate of the protagonists and I was alienated by the fact that instead of horror I was being served a love story straight out of a cheap women's novel. This film is pure kitsch, and it's not even entertaining kitsch. That's two strikes. The fact that good actors were wasted in this film is strike three. Coppola, you're out. I'll stick to classics like 'Nosferatu'.

    now, after reading the book and watching the movie for the third time i officially blame the director and screenwriter for the twilight movies as they made it a rule that all vampires must have some sort of stupid love interest. i don't know if Ford Coppola tried to do a parody of the book but he has certainly succeeded doing that. and although the book is bad the movie evidently is worse. i remember watching it as a kid and thinking that it was the coolest movie ever made. apparently i did not take in consideration the almost pornographic scenes, all the moaning and the breasts flying all over the place and especially the really bad acting. and although i did not like the book, it felt that Dracula was exactly how a film adaptation should not be made. just for commercial purpose.

    A young lawyer named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves, though Coppola has openly criticized his own reasoning for casting Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker ; according to him, he needed a young, hot star that would connect with the girls) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe . He is captured and imprisoned by a strange vampire and his bloodsucker girlfriends . He really is a 15th-century Romanian warrior who lives on through the ages and gone back life . Avenging the death of his beloved wife ; the undead vampire named Dracula (Gary Oldman , among those who auditioned for the part were Andy Garcia , Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas and Viggo Mortensen) comes to England to seduce a visitor's fianc&eacute;e (Winona Rider) and inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers , but these supernatural powers have sinister origins . Dracula starts a reign of seduction and horror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost) . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords (Gary Elwes , Bill Campbell , Keanu Reeves) acquiring the assistance of the Vampire expert Prof. Abraham Van Helsing 8anthony Hopkins) . Colorful version about the famous personage with an all-star cast , brilliant cinematography by Michael Balhaus , glamorous gowns and spectacular production design by Thomas Sanders , including evocative sights on Victorian London . And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in &uml;Mishima&uml; produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup. This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : "Bram Stoker's Count Dracula" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; &uml; Dracula&uml; (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , &uml;Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version &uml;Dracula&uml;2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .
