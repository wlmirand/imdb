    Great plot and idea. Poor visuals due to early years of production. Very weak actors (in my opinion).AND THE MOST ANNOYING- DISTURBING- DISGUSTING-GURGLING-WOBBLING NARRATOR COMPUTER VOICE EVER. It almost destroyed my poor ears during film watching. But luckily, i survived. Sound effects and music design is miserable too, considering the main theme of the movie. Story line of video-film is V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W and have no dynamic scenes at all, but this is common stuff for 60s, 70s movies. Hoping, that Brazil (1985) with similar storyline will be far better! Can't say anything more.

    This film by Jean Luc-Godard is an intentional mixture of the profound and the ridiculous, which is part of its existentialist satirical plan. Eddie Constantine satirizes himself and much else besides as Lemmy Caution, Spy 003 from the Outer Countries who has been sent to Alphaville, the capital of another galaxy. Three years earlier he had already made fun of himself as the archetypal tough guy detective in the spoof film L'EMPIRE DE LA NUIT (THE EMPIRE OF NIGHT, 1962). Since Eddie reached Alphaville (despite its being in another galaxy) by car, we later learn that it can be reached by driving along the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique all night. (For those unfamiliar with Paris, the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique is the Paris ring road.) Eddie disguises himself as Ivan Johnson, a journalist working for the newspaper Figaro-Pravda. For those too young to remember, Pravda was the name of the newspaper of the Soviet Union, and Le Figaro is the conservative newspaper of Paris; the idea of their having merged at this unknown time in the future is one of Godard's dozens of little jokes. Some of the humour was funnier in the sixties than now, but much of it is still amusing. In most scenes, Eddie wears his trenchcoat with the collar turned up and his hat, whether indoors or out. He often flails his automatic pistol in his hand and shoots lots of people to right and to left, who obligingly drop down dead. Godard uses hyper-dramatic music just like what was used in the American films noir of the forties and fifties, and he plays it on purpose at the most inappropriate moments: more intentional hysterical fun. Many of the jokes are of a cinematic nature, so you have to know your movies. The French New Wave directors adored Hitchcock and Hollywood noir films, so the satire is always mixed with homage. Alphaville is populated by futuristic 'mutants' who have moved beyond feelings and follow perfect logic, to form a new perfect species. Anyone who feels anything is executed. There is an amazing scene where a man who dared to grieve when his wife died is machine-gunned to death on a diving board and falls into the swimming pool. Such eruptions of surrealism are common in the film, as are mournful expressions of existentialist anguish narrated on the sound track. Every week, several words such as 'tendresse' ('tenderness') are erased from the Bible (their name for the dictionary of permitted words), and anyone uttering them is executed. No one in Alphaville has ever heard the word 'love' or the word 'conscience'. All women are branded with tattooed numbers like inmates of the Nazi death camps, and all are sex slaves, at least the attractive ones. There are no unattractive women in the film, so perhaps they were also all executed for the offence of being ugly. At the time he made this film, Godard still had talent and had not yet deteriorated into whatever he became twenty years later, when he made what I have described in my review of it as 'the most pretentious film ever made', namely D&Eacute;TECTIVE (1985, see my review). The female lead in this film is the mysterious and alluring Anna Karina, who had many men round the world gasping at that time, although when she gives those long lingering looks in loving closeups she does seem a bit too conscious of her own charms sometimes. But then, that has also been a fault of Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, and female vanity when it becomes visible can be most unsettling, not to say irritating. Karina plays Natacha von Braun, the daughter of Professor von Braun who was expelled to Alphaville in 1964 (the year this film was being made), bringing his daughter with him who is now, in the future, all grown up and beautiful but unable to know how to say those magic words: 'I love you.' However, as she is not really a native of Alphaville, Eddie sees some hope for her. Her father, whom she tells Eddie she has never met, had worked at Los Alamos, and is clearly intended as a reference to the SS officer and rocket scientist Werner von Braun who created the American space programme, though the exact point of the satire concerning this point is lost on me, I am sad to say. Nearly every scene of this film contains interesting lines, either of dialogue or of voice-over, much of it poetry. Among other things, we are told that poetry 'turns darkness into light'. This film, in between all the foolery, is a plea for love, beauty, and poetry. If it did not relentlessly make fun of itself, we might be tempted to say it takes itself too seriously, but it does a balancing act between farce and anguished existentialism, as if Sartre had suddenly become Groucho Marx (and who is to say he never did, or was not all along?) Alphaville is run by a giant computer with 1.4 billion 'nodes', or terminals, called Alpha 60. It has a deep grumbly voice which gives the impression of being several octaves lower than Orson Welles. Alpha 60 wants to wage war on the Outer Countries such as Earth in order to eradicate emotion and feeling, but instead, in the latter part of the film, the inhabitants of Alphaville are all staggering round and falling down dead because of lack of love. Perhaps they did not know whether to laugh or to cry, anymore than we do when watching this, and died of incoherence. (One wonders whether Al-Ghazzali died of it also, or whether he perished from a simple excess of orthodoxy.) The final words spoken in the film are the most important, and confirm our suspicions that this film had a profound and serious purpose, but I cannot reveal them to the uninitiated, any more than I can explain the point of a dagger against the bared chest.

    Is it trashy art or arty trash? Who cares? The cinematography is pure heaven. The soundtrack is a buzz (even the moments of total silence rock). And the swimming pool scene? Well...you gotta see it to believe it, man. Still an influence on modern film and music, including albums released in 2011 by Bryan Ferry and Hyperbubble, Alphaville rewards repeated viewings with clues that you can't believe you missed the first time. It's rough, but sweet...brainy, yet fun...totally clich&eacute;d, yet totally imaginative. I cherish every frame. In a world flooded with films created for the purely logical reason of making money, Alphaville's visit from a galaxy where movies are made for the love of film is always welcome.

    How do you spell "Alphaville"? Capital B-O-R-I-N-G! This movie was a sluggish, mind-numbingly dull snore-fest, if I've ever seen one. Set in the future (at an unspecified date), there was absolutely nothing at all "futuristic" about Alphaville in any way, shape, or form. I found Alphaville to basically be a staggeringly pretentious, 1960's, euro-trash mess. Filled with all sorts of idiotic symbolism, it completely lacked a coherent and worthwhile story enough to keep the viewer interested for more than just a few minutes at a time. Considered by many (I don't know why) to be very "avant-garde", Alphaville was directed by French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard who, in the 1960s, was literally churning out about 5 to 6 movies a year. So, just by that alone, you can get a pretty clear picture of exactly how much real thought and care was put into this film's story, its production and its overall character development. If nothing else, Alphaville is a really great sleeping pill that's sure to be of help to any of you frustrated insomniacs out there. Zzzzzzz! Nighty-Night!

    The retro noir elements of ALPHAVILLE: THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF LEMMY CAUTION would eventually be used to even greater effect in BLADE RUNNER (in which Production Design more or less IS the movie); and, in both, the hero falls for a woman created by the technocracy running the galaxy. Suffering, we learn in ALPHAVILLE ("city of whores," where women are tattooed with serial numbers), requires its own religion: "We are totally alone here," intones the Alpha 60: "We are unique, dreadfully unique." "This dump of yours isn't ALPHAville," Caution counters: "It's ZEROville." "What is the privilege of the dead?" the Alpha 60 asks. "To die no more," Caution answers. Alpha 60: "Do you know what illuminates the night?" "Poetry," Caution responds. Useful people are assimilated, unusable ones killed or recycled ("re-educated"). At one point, our hero discovers that the word "conscience" has been deleted from the dictionary. It's an interesting sequence, in which we come to see the correlation between being "conscious" and having a "conscience." Or simply being conscious of conscience... The movie is rife with names like Lemmy Caution, Eckel and Jeckel, and Dr. Nosferatu, etc., and the overly-melodramatic music harks back to the aforementioned films noir- but the incorrect use of the term "light years" makes one wonder if maybe something hasn't been lost in translation.

    I really wanted to like the movie, firstly because I like the new wave of French cinema made in the 60's and secondly, because the plot seemed to be something that would strongly appeal to my cinematographic interests when it comes down to dystopian movies. Being a person that watched quite a few titles throughout his life I must say I was seldom more irritated by a movie like this one that managed to make me turn it off after as little as thirty minutes. I don't really know why Godard didn't manage to pull this off, I suppose that he wasn't entirely aware of what he should be doing in order to create a Orwellian, dictatorship driven, anti utopian movie. It starts off extremely unpromising, as the environment is a patchwork of symbols that were not by any means used in place, not to mention the sound used for the movie was the most inappropriate thriller - like type of sound that they could possibly pick up from just any half - decent crime movie made by the same time. If you manage to neglect the messed up environment that is a patchwork of this and that but never manages to make it up to the full picture that it should represent, there is no possible way you won't get extremely irritated by the computer - generated - Big brother - type of voice that brags nonsense that tries to sound as if it's brainwashing the listener. Beware that this is light-years behind 1984 - a movie, based on a great novel crafted to perfection - a dystopian masterpiece, that I can only praise. After wanting to smash my sound system and after trying to adjust it well enough so the inadequate sound effects won't damage the proper functions of my nerves, I started thinking how this movie would have been a masterpiece if created by Pasolini. I remember how he managed to pull out the entire Theorema using the sound of a church bell, which by no means sounded anywhere that inappropriate as the sound effects found here. Apart from that I do believe he would have done great job in implementing the political meaning into the movie. Godard failed in his attempt to be overly artsy in an environment that was probably chosen by himself - one that managed to fail his movie even more. As a conclusion, with a little bit of sadness I should admit that at least the cover art looks somehow acceptable and pleasant, and that is why I bother to give one star to this hour and a half tape of lost meanings.

    This is the first movie i've seen from this director and i'm completely stunned!!! And i've seen hundreds of different movies, from all genres etc. the idea behind the movie, the destructive (in this case) relation between poetry,love vs straight reason/logic is played brilliantly through out the movie. this relation is played out, almost poetically, i would dare to say. The acting is superb, very convincing in my opinion, i didn't know the actors but they did a very god job. Visually i liked a lot, the flashes through out the movie with the shining lights with the famous Einstein equations didn't bother me at all, it all makes sense. and the computer voice! goddamn it reminded me of Hall 9000 the most bad-ass computer in cinema history, but this one is sinister enough, it's the same concept. It's such a good movie that it's impossible to classify in a genre,i can only put it in the same basket as movies like Dr strange love, 2001 spaceodissey or Apocalypse now, MOVIES THAT TRANSCEND CINEMA AND BECAME PURE WORKS OF ART. Seriously, how can this movie not be present in IMDb top 250? it amazes me very very much. However this is a movie that won't appreciate everyone (romantic-comedy lovers for ex. run for your lives!!) and i can understand it, ART IS A SUBJECTIVE THING AND IN THE END OF IT, IT'S ALWAYS A MATTER OF PERSONAL OPINION. But if you have some imagination, and you like to use it by doing that spectacular process called THINKING, then this is the film for you, a definitively MUST SEE!!! sorry about the English

    Jean-Luc Godard is considered to be one of the top ten directors of all time. He influenced such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Jim Jarmusch, Wong Kar-wai, Wim Wenders,Pier Paolo Pasolini, John Woo, Brian De Palma, and Oliver Stone. In this film, he spoofs typical detective movies. It is certainly one that is designed to get you thinking, as the setting is a controlled society where emotions are banned - banned to the point that they result in a death sentence. Eddie Constantine was perfect in the role of hard-boiled detective in a trench coat and fedora, ala Sam Spade.

    This bizarre but compelling science-fiction noir evokes the uncomfortably accurate future-world of George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadows Patrick McGoohan's TV series THE PRISONER, made shortly afterwards and surely influenced by Godard's movie. The nightmarish totalitarian world of ALPHVILLE, which may be another planet or simply a reworked European superstate, sits well against a backdrop of avant garde 1960s architectural monstrosities. Like cowboy films, Sci-Fi movies always seems to reflect the era in which they are made more strongly that the imagined future in which they are set. ALPHAVILLE strives to be the future but is rooted in the hipness of the mid 60s every bit as securely as BLOW-UP or HELP. Chanderlesque private-eye Lemmy Caution strides through the movie with grim expression and gnarled features, a gun in the pocket of his trench coat and a soul-less girl on every hotel landing ready to tend to his every desire, should he ask her. Normally he simply shoves her away and tells her to clear off! In the midst of vast empty corridors and sparsely-populated offices, with the kind of all pervading surveillance devices that would have been familiar to NUMBER 6 in THE PRISONER, Caution witnesses bizarre ritualistic executions of those who've been 'caught' feeling forbidden emotion....at a swimming pool.... and takes up with the stunningly attractive daughter of the dictator Von Baun, played by Godard's wife, the wonderful Anna Karina. The story is frequently hard to follow and it's political edge is sometimes overbearing but at the denouement, which makes sense and is truly surreal at the same time , it leaves one more intrigued than frustrated and keen to re-watch it. A common trait with Godard's work of the period. Eddie Constantine is really rather well cast as Caution; the lived-in face and gruff persona fit the part. Karina is just gorgeous and the whole film would be worth staying with for her performance alone. She's spell-binding. Not an easy film to watch but one that is often starkly compelling and uncomfortably accurate in foretelling the world we now live in. Viewed now almost 50 years after it was made, ALPHAVILLE is , in it's own way, a film about political correctness and the inevitable slide towards impersonal Super-States and endlessly tightening control.

    From director Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless, aka &Agrave; Bout De souffl&eacute;), this French film was featured in the pages of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I had to see if it was worth that acclaim. Basically American secret agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine), posing under the identity of journalist Ivan Johnson, has come from "The Outlands" to the futuristic city of Alphaville, located on another planet. Despite looking like a regular reporter with a tan overcoat, fedora hat and an Instamatic camera to photograph everything, significant or not, he also carries a pistol and he is on a series of missions. He must search for the missing secret agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); he must capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Prof. Leonard Nosferatu aka Von Braun (Howard Vernon); and he must destroy Alphaville itself, and specifically its dictatorial computer system, Alpha 60. The entire city is controlled by Alpha 60, so all the citizens obey the rules that there will never be any free will, individualism or expressionism, such as poetry, love and true emotion, and they will never ask "why" and will always answer "because", and if these rules are broken they will be interrogated and eliminated, so everyone is essentially a mindless drone. The famous Albert Einstein formula equation E = mc&sup2;, and E = hf, are seen in various places around Alphaville, suggesting a "logical" scientific ruling throughout the city. Caution does Dickson who dies making love to "Seductress Third Class", so he enlists the help of Professor Von Braun's daughter Natacha (Anna Karina), a programmer of Alpha 60, and as time goes by she is unknowingly gaining emotion and going against the rules of the city laws. Caution is caught by the city authorities for ensuing these emotions and ideas in people when it is illegal, and he gets to meet Professor Von Braun who offers him the chance to join Alphaville, maybe even ruling the galaxy, but in the end he of course refuses and destroys the Alpha 60 computer, meaning that the city's population become normal, and he also rescues Natacha who declares she loves him. Also starring L&aacute;szl&oacute; Szab&oacute; as Chief Engineer, Michel Delahaye as Von Braun's Assistant, Jean-Andr&eacute; Fieschi as Prof. Heckell and Jean-Louis Comolli as Prof. Jeckell. The performance by Constantine as the private eye on assignment is suitably world-weary, and everyone else with hardly any expression at all adds to the feeling of a soulless nightmare, it is a good blend of classic film noir and science-fiction together, a most interesting futuristic detective drama. Very good!

Filled with all sorts of idiotic symbolism, it completely lacked a coherent and worthwhile story enough to keep the viewer interested for more than just a few minutes at a time. Considered by many (I don't know why) to be very "avant-garde", Alphaville was directed by French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard who, in the 1960s, was literally churning out about 5 to 6 movies a year. So, just by that alone, you can get a pretty clear picture of exactly how much real thought and care was put into this film's story, its production and its overall character development. If nothing else, Alphaville is a really great sleeping pill that's sure to be of help to any of you frustrated insomniacs out there. Zzzzzzz! Nighty-Night!

    The retro noir elements of ALPHAVILLE: THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF LEMMY CAUTION would eventually be used to even greater effect in BLADE RUNNER (in which Production Design more or less IS the movie); and, in both, the hero falls for a woman created by the technocracy running the galaxy. Suffering, we learn in ALPHAVILLE ("city of whores," where women are tattooed with serial numbers), requires its own religion: "We are totally alone here," intones the Alpha 60: "We are unique, dreadfully unique." "This dump of yours isn't ALPHAville," Caution counters: "It's ZEROville." "What is the privilege of the dead?" the Alpha 60 asks. "To die no more," Caution answers. Alpha 60: "Do you know what illuminates the night?" "Poetry," Caution responds. Useful people are assimilated, unusable ones killed or recycled ("re-educated"). At one point, our hero discovers that the word "conscience" has been deleted from the dictionary. It's an interesting sequence, in which we come to see the correlation between being "conscious" and having a "conscience." Or simply being conscious of conscience... The movie is rife with names like Lemmy Caution, Eckel and Jeckel, and Dr. Nosferatu, etc., and the overly-melodramatic music harks back to the aforementioned films noir- but the incorrect use of the term "light years" makes one wonder if maybe something hasn't been lost in translation.

    I really wanted to like the movie, firstly because I like the new wave of French cinema made in the 60's and secondly, because the plot seemed to be something that would strongly appeal to my cinematographic interests when it comes down to dystopian movies. Being a person that watched quite a few titles throughout his life I must say I was seldom more irritated by a movie like this one that managed to make me turn it off after as little as thirty minutes. I don't really know why Godard didn't manage to pull this off, I suppose that he wasn't entirely aware of what he should be doing in order to create a Orwellian, dictatorship driven, anti utopian movie. It starts off extremely unpromising, as the environment is a patchwork of symbols that were not by any means used in place, not to mention the sound used for the movie was the most inappropriate thriller - like type of sound that they could possibly pick up from just any half - decent crime movie made by the same time. If you manage to neglect the messed up environment that is a patchwork of this and that but never manages to make it up to the full picture that it should represent, there is no possible way you won't get extremely irritated by the computer - generated - Big brother - type of voice that brags nonsense that tries to sound as if it's brainwashing the listener. Beware that this is light-years behind 1984 - a movie, based on a great novel crafted to perfection - a dystopian masterpiece, that I can only praise. After wanting to smash my sound system and after trying to adjust it well enough so the inadequate sound effects won't damage the proper functions of my nerves, I started thinking how this movie would have been a masterpiece if created by Pasolini. I remember how he managed to pull out the entire Theorema using the sound of a church bell, which by no means sounded anywhere that inappropriate as the sound effects found here. Apart from that I do believe he would have done great job in implementing the political meaning into the movie. Godard failed in his attempt to be overly artsy in an environment that was probably chosen by himself - one that managed to fail his movie even more. As a conclusion, with a little bit of sadness I should admit that at least the cover art looks somehow acceptable and pleasant, and that is why I bother to give one star to this hour and a half tape of lost meanings.

    This is the first movie i've seen from this director and i'm completely stunned!!! And i've seen hundreds of different movies, from all genres etc. the idea behind the movie, the destructive (in this case) relation between poetry,love vs straight reason/logic is played brilliantly through out the movie. this relation is played out, almost poetically, i would dare to say. The acting is superb, very convincing in my opinion, i didn't know the actors but they did a very god job. Visually i liked a lot, the flashes through out the movie with the shining lights with the famous Einstein equations didn't bother me at all, it all makes sense. and the computer voice! goddamn it reminded me of Hall 9000 the most bad-ass computer in cinema history, but this one is sinister enough, it's the same concept. It's such a good movie that it's impossible to classify in a genre,i can only put it in the same basket as movies like Dr strange love, 2001 spaceodissey or Apocalypse now, MOVIES THAT TRANSCEND CINEMA AND BECAME PURE WORKS OF ART. Seriously, how can this movie not be present in IMDb top 250? it amazes me very very much. However this is a movie that won't appreciate everyone (romantic-comedy lovers for ex. run for your lives!!) and i can understand it, ART IS A SUBJECTIVE THING AND IN THE END OF IT, IT'S ALWAYS A MATTER OF PERSONAL OPINION. But if you have some imagination, and you like to use it by doing that spectacular process called THINKING, then this is the film for you, a definitively MUST SEE!!! sorry about the English

    Jean-Luc Godard is considered to be one of the top ten directors of all time. He influenced such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Jim Jarmusch, Wong Kar-wai, Wim Wenders,Pier Paolo Pasolini, John Woo, Brian De Palma, and Oliver Stone. In this film, he spoofs typical detective movies. It is certainly one that is designed to get you thinking, as the setting is a controlled society where emotions are banned - banned to the point that they result in a death sentence. Eddie Constantine was perfect in the role of hard-boiled detective in a trench coat and fedora, ala Sam Spade.

    This bizarre but compelling science-fiction noir evokes the uncomfortably accurate future-world of George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadows Patrick McGoohan's TV series THE PRISONER, made shortly afterwards and surely influenced by Godard's movie. The nightmarish totalitarian world of ALPHVILLE, which may be another planet or simply a reworked European superstate, sits well against a backdrop of avant garde 1960s architectural monstrosities. Like cowboy films, Sci-Fi movies always seems to reflect the era in which they are made more strongly that the imagined future in which they are set. ALPHAVILLE strives to be the future but is rooted in the hipness of the mid 60s every bit as securely as BLOW-UP or HELP. Chanderlesque private-eye Lemmy Caution strides through the movie with grim expression and gnarled features, a gun in the pocket of his trench coat and a soul-less girl on every hotel landing ready to tend to his every desire, should he ask her. Normally he simply shoves her away and tells her to clear off! In the midst of vast empty corridors and sparsely-populated offices, with the kind of all pervading surveillance devices that would have been familiar to NUMBER 6 in THE PRISONER, Caution witnesses bizarre ritualistic executions of those who've been 'caught' feeling forbidden emotion....at a swimming pool.... and takes up with the stunningly attractive daughter of the dictator Von Baun, played by Godard's wife, the wonderful Anna Karina. The story is frequently hard to follow and it's political edge is sometimes overbearing but at the denouement, which makes sense and is truly surreal at the same time , it leaves one more intrigued than frustrated and keen to re-watch it. A common trait with Godard's work of the period. Eddie Constantine is really rather well cast as Caution; the lived-in face and gruff persona fit the part. Karina is just gorgeous and the whole film would be worth staying with for her performance alone. She's spell-binding. Not an easy film to watch but one that is often starkly compelling and uncomfortably accurate in foretelling the world we now live in. Viewed now almost 50 years after it was made, ALPHAVILLE is , in it's own way, a film about political correctness and the inevitable slide towards impersonal Super-States and endlessly tightening control.

    From director Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless, aka &Agrave; Bout De souffl&eacute;), this French film was featured in the pages of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I had to see if it was worth that acclaim. Basically American secret agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine), posing under the identity of journalist Ivan Johnson, has come from "The Outlands" to the futuristic city of Alphaville, located on another planet. Despite looking like a regular reporter with a tan overcoat, fedora hat and an Instamatic camera to photograph everything, significant or not, he also carries a pistol and he is on a series of missions. He must search for the missing secret agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); he must capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Prof. Leonard Nosferatu aka Von Braun (Howard Vernon); and he must destroy Alphaville itself, and specifically its dictatorial computer system, Alpha 60. The entire city is controlled by Alpha 60, so all the citizens obey the rules that there will never be any free will, individualism or expressionism, such as poetry, love and true emotion, and they will never ask "why" and will always answer "because", and if these rules are broken they will be interrogated and eliminated, so everyone is essentially a mindless drone. The famous Albert Einstein formula equation E = mc&sup2;, and E = hf, are seen in various places around Alphaville, suggesting a "logical" scientific ruling throughout the city. Caution does Dickson who dies making love to "Seductress Third Class", so he enlists the help of Professor Von Braun's daughter Natacha (Anna Karina), a programmer of Alpha 60, and as time goes by she is unknowingly gaining emotion and going against the rules of the city laws. Caution is caught by the city authorities for ensuing these emotions and ideas in people when it is illegal, and he gets to meet Professor Von Braun who offers him the chance to join Alphaville, maybe even ruling the galaxy, but in the end he of course refuses and destroys the Alpha 60 computer, meaning that the city's population become normal, and he also rescues Natacha who declares she loves him. Also starring L&aacute;szl&oacute; Szab&oacute; as Chief Engineer, Michel Delahaye as Von Braun's Assistant, Jean-Andr&eacute; Fieschi as Prof. Heckell and Jean-Louis Comolli as Prof. Jeckell. The performance by Constantine as the private eye on assignment is suitably world-weary, and everyone else with hardly any expression at all adds to the feeling of a soulless nightmare, it is a good blend of classic film noir and science-fiction together, a most interesting futuristic detective drama. Very good!

    Great plot and idea. Poor visuals due to early years of production. Very weak actors (in my opinion).AND THE MOST ANNOYING- DISTURBING- DISGUSTING-GURGLING-WOBBLING NARRATOR COMPUTER VOICE EVER. It almost destroyed my poor ears during film watching. But luckily, i survived. Sound effects and music design is miserable too, considering the main theme of the movie. Story line of video-film is V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W and have no dynamic scenes at all, but this is common stuff for 60s, 70s movies. Hoping, that Brazil (1985) with similar storyline will be far better! Can't say anything more.

    This film by Jean Luc-Godard is an intentional mixture of the profound and the ridiculous, which is part of its existentialist satirical plan. Eddie Constantine satirizes himself and much else besides as Lemmy Caution, Spy 003 from the Outer Countries who has been sent to Alphaville, the capital of another galaxy. Three years earlier he had already made fun of himself as the archetypal tough guy detective in the spoof film L'EMPIRE DE LA NUIT (THE EMPIRE OF NIGHT, 1962). Since Eddie reached Alphaville (despite its being in another galaxy) by car, we later learn that it can be reached by driving along the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique all night. (For those unfamiliar with Paris, the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique is the Paris ring road.) Eddie disguises himself as Ivan Johnson, a journalist working for the newspaper Figaro-Pravda. For those too young to remember, Pravda was the name of the newspaper of the Soviet Union, and Le Figaro is the conservative newspaper of Paris; the idea of their having merged at this unknown time in the future is one of Godard's dozens of little jokes. Some of the humour was funnier in the sixties than now, but much of it is still amusing. In most scenes, Eddie wears his trenchcoat with the collar turned up and his hat, whether indoors or out. He often flails his automatic pistol in his hand and shoots lots of people to right and to left, who obligingly drop down dead. Godard uses hyper-dramatic music just like what was used in the American films noir of the forties and fifties, and he plays it on purpose at the most inappropriate moments: more intentional hysterical fun. Many of the jokes are of a cinematic nature, so you have to know your movies. The French New Wave directors adored Hitchcock and Hollywood noir films, so the satire is always mixed with homage. Alphaville is populated by futuristic 'mutants' who have moved beyond feelings and follow perfect logic, to form a new perfect species. Anyone who feels anything is executed. There is an amazing scene where a man who dared to grieve when his wife died is machine-gunned to death on a diving board and falls into the swimming pool. Such eruptions of surrealism are common in the film, as are mournful expressions of existentialist anguish narrated on the sound track. Every week, several words such as 'tendresse' ('tenderness') are erased from the Bible (their name for the dictionary of permitted words), and anyone uttering them is executed. No one in Alphaville has ever heard the word 'love' or the word 'conscience'. All women are branded with tattooed numbers like inmates of the Nazi death camps, and all are sex slaves, at least the attractive ones. There are no unattractive women in the film, so perhaps they were also all executed for the offence of being ugly. At the time he made this film, Godard still had talent and had not yet deteriorated into whatever he became twenty years later, when he made what I have described in my review of it as 'the most pretentious film ever made', namely D&Eacute;TECTIVE (1985, see my review). The female lead in this film is the mysterious and alluring Anna Karina, who had many men round the world gasping at that time, although when she gives those long lingering looks in loving closeups she does seem a bit too conscious of her own charms sometimes. But then, that has also been a fault of Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, and female vanity when it becomes visible can be most unsettling, not to say irritating. Karina plays Natacha von Braun, the daughter of Professor von Braun who was expelled to Alphaville in 1964 (the year this film was being made), bringing his daughter with him who is now, in the future, all grown up and beautiful but unable to know how to say those magic words: 'I love you.' However, as she is not really a native of Alphaville, Eddie sees some hope for her. Her father, whom she tells Eddie she has never met, had worked at Los Alamos, and is clearly intended as a reference to the SS officer and rocket scientist Werner von Braun who created the American space programme, though the exact point of the satire concerning this point is lost on me, I am sad to say. Nearly every scene of this film contains interesting lines, either of dialogue or of voice-over, much of it poetry. Among other things, we are told that poetry 'turns darkness into light'. This film, in between all the foolery, is a plea for love, beauty, and poetry. If it did not relentlessly make fun of itself, we might be tempted to say it takes itself too seriously, but it does a balancing act between farce and anguished existentialism, as if Sartre had suddenly become Groucho Marx (and who is to say he never did, or was not all along?) Alphaville is run by a giant computer with 1.4 billion 'nodes', or terminals, called Alpha 60. It has a deep grumbly voice which gives the impression of being several octaves lower than Orson Welles. Alpha 60 wants to wage war on the Outer Countries such as Earth in order to eradicate emotion and feeling, but instead, in the latter part of the film, the inhabitants of Alphaville are all staggering round and falling down dead because of lack of love. Perhaps they did not know whether to laugh or to cry, anymore than we do when watching this, and died of incoherence. (One wonders whether Al-Ghazzali died of it also, or whether he perished from a simple excess of orthodoxy.) The final words spoken in the film are the most important, and confirm our suspicions that this film had a profound and serious purpose, but I cannot reveal them to the uninitiated, any more than I can explain the point of a dagger against the bared chest.

    Is it trashy art or arty trash? Who cares? The cinematography is pure heaven. The soundtrack is a buzz (even the moments of total silence rock). And the swimming pool scene? Well...you gotta see it to believe it, man. Still an influence on modern film and music, including albums released in 2011 by Bryan Ferry and Hyperbubble, Alphaville rewards repeated viewings with clues that you can't believe you missed the first time. It's rough, but sweet...brainy, yet fun...totally clich&eacute;d, yet totally imaginative. I cherish every frame. In a world flooded with films created for the purely logical reason of making money, Alphaville's visit from a galaxy where movies are made for the love of film is always welcome.

    How do you spell "Alphaville"? Capital B-O-R-I-N-G! This movie was a sluggish, mind-numbingly dull snore-fest, if I've ever seen one. Set in the future (at an unspecified date), there was absolutely nothing at all "futuristic" about Alphaville in any way, shape, or form. I found Alphaville to basically be a staggeringly pretentious, 1960's, euro-trash mess.

    From director Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless, aka &Agrave; Bout De souffl&eacute;), this French film was featured in the pages of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I had to see if it was worth that acclaim. Basically American secret agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine), posing under the identity of journalist Ivan Johnson, has come from "The Outlands" to the futuristic city of Alphaville, located on another planet. Despite looking like a regular reporter with a tan overcoat, fedora hat and an Instamatic camera to photograph everything, significant or not, he also carries a pistol and he is on a series of missions. He must search for the missing secret agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); he must capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Prof. Leonard Nosferatu aka Von Braun (Howard Vernon); and he must destroy Alphaville itself, and specifically its dictatorial computer system, Alpha 60. The entire city is controlled by Alpha 60, so all the citizens obey the rules that there will never be any free will, individualism or expressionism, such as poetry, love and true emotion, and they will never ask "why" and will always answer "because", and if these rules are broken they will be interrogated and eliminated, so everyone is essentially a mindless drone. The famous Albert Einstein formula equation E = mc&sup2;, and E = hf, are seen in various places around Alphaville, suggesting a "logical" scientific ruling throughout the city. Caution does Dickson who dies making love to "Seductress Third Class", so he enlists the help of Professor Von Braun's daughter Natacha (Anna Karina), a programmer of Alpha 60, and as time goes by she is unknowingly gaining emotion and going against the rules of the city laws. Caution is caught by the city authorities for ensuing these emotions and ideas in people when it is illegal, and he gets to meet Professor Von Braun who offers him the chance to join Alphaville, maybe even ruling the galaxy, but in the end he of course refuses and destroys the Alpha 60 computer, meaning that the city's population become normal, and he also rescues Natacha who declares she loves him. Also starring L&aacute;szl&oacute; Szab&oacute; as Chief Engineer, Michel Delahaye as Von Braun's Assistant, Jean-Andr&eacute; Fieschi as Prof. Heckell and Jean-Louis Comolli as Prof. Jeckell. The performance by Constantine as the private eye on assignment is suitably world-weary, and everyone else with hardly any expression at all adds to the feeling of a soulless nightmare, it is a good blend of classic film noir and science-fiction together, a most interesting futuristic detective drama. Very good!

    Great plot and idea. Poor visuals due to early years of production. Very weak actors (in my opinion).AND THE MOST ANNOYING- DISTURBING- DISGUSTING-GURGLING-WOBBLING NARRATOR COMPUTER VOICE EVER. It almost destroyed my poor ears during film watching. But luckily, i survived. Sound effects and music design is miserable too, considering the main theme of the movie. Story line of video-film is V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W and have no dynamic scenes at all, but this is common stuff for 60s, 70s movies. Hoping, that Brazil (1985) with similar storyline will be far better! Can't say anything more.

    This film by Jean Luc-Godard is an intentional mixture of the profound and the ridiculous, which is part of its existentialist satirical plan. Eddie Constantine satirizes himself and much else besides as Lemmy Caution, Spy 003 from the Outer Countries who has been sent to Alphaville, the capital of another galaxy. Three years earlier he had already made fun of himself as the archetypal tough guy detective in the spoof film L'EMPIRE DE LA NUIT (THE EMPIRE OF NIGHT, 1962). Since Eddie reached Alphaville (despite its being in another galaxy) by car, we later learn that it can be reached by driving along the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique all night. (For those unfamiliar with Paris, the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique is the Paris ring road.) Eddie disguises himself as Ivan Johnson, a journalist working for the newspaper Figaro-Pravda. For those too young to remember, Pravda was the name of the newspaper of the Soviet Union, and Le Figaro is the conservative newspaper of Paris; the idea of their having merged at this unknown time in the future is one of Godard's dozens of little jokes. Some of the humour was funnier in the sixties than now, but much of it is still amusing. In most scenes, Eddie wears his trenchcoat with the collar turned up and his hat, whether indoors or out. He often flails his automatic pistol in his hand and shoots lots of people to right and to left, who obligingly drop down dead. Godard uses hyper-dramatic music just like what was used in the American films noir of the forties and fifties, and he plays it on purpose at the most inappropriate moments: more intentional hysterical fun. Many of the jokes are of a cinematic nature, so you have to know your movies. The French New Wave directors adored Hitchcock and Hollywood noir films, so the satire is always mixed with homage. Alphaville is populated by futuristic 'mutants' who have moved beyond feelings and follow perfect logic, to form a new perfect species. Anyone who feels anything is executed. There is an amazing scene where a man who dared to grieve when his wife died is machine-gunned to death on a diving board and falls into the swimming pool. Such eruptions of surrealism are common in the film, as are mournful expressions of existentialist anguish narrated on the sound track. Every week, several words such as 'tendresse' ('tenderness') are erased from the Bible (their name for the dictionary of permitted words), and anyone uttering them is executed. No one in Alphaville has ever heard the word 'love' or the word 'conscience'. All women are branded with tattooed numbers like inmates of the Nazi death camps, and all are sex slaves, at least the attractive ones. There are no unattractive women in the film, so perhaps they were also all executed for the offence of being ugly. At the time he made this film, Godard still had talent and had not yet deteriorated into whatever he became twenty years later, when he made what I have described in my review of it as 'the most pretentious film ever made', namely D&Eacute;TECTIVE (1985, see my review). The female lead in this film is the mysterious and alluring Anna Karina, who had many men round the world gasping at that time, although when she gives those long lingering looks in loving closeups she does seem a bit too conscious of her own charms sometimes. But then, that has also been a fault of Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, and female vanity when it becomes visible can be most unsettling, not to say irritating. Karina plays Natacha von Braun, the daughter of Professor von Braun who was expelled to Alphaville in 1964 (the year this film was being made), bringing his daughter with him who is now, in the future, all grown up and beautiful but unable to know how to say those magic words: 'I love you.' However, as she is not really a native of Alphaville, Eddie sees some hope for her. Her father, whom she tells Eddie she has never met, had worked at Los Alamos, and is clearly intended as a reference to the SS officer and rocket scientist Werner von Braun who created the American space programme, though the exact point of the satire concerning this point is lost on me, I am sad to say. Nearly every scene of this film contains interesting lines, either of dialogue or of voice-over, much of it poetry. Among other things, we are told that poetry 'turns darkness into light'. This film, in between all the foolery, is a plea for love, beauty, and poetry. If it did not relentlessly make fun of itself, we might be tempted to say it takes itself too seriously, but it does a balancing act between farce and anguished existentialism, as if Sartre had suddenly become Groucho Marx (and who is to say he never did, or was not all along?) Alphaville is run by a giant computer with 1.4 billion 'nodes', or terminals, called Alpha 60. It has a deep grumbly voice which gives the impression of being several octaves lower than Orson Welles. Alpha 60 wants to wage war on the Outer Countries such as Earth in order to eradicate emotion and feeling, but instead, in the latter part of the film, the inhabitants of Alphaville are all staggering round and falling down dead because of lack of love. Perhaps they did not know whether to laugh or to cry, anymore than we do when watching this, and died of incoherence. (One wonders whether Al-Ghazzali died of it also, or whether he perished from a simple excess of orthodoxy.) The final words spoken in the film are the most important, and confirm our suspicions that this film had a profound and serious purpose, but I cannot reveal them to the uninitiated, any more than I can explain the point of a dagger against the bared chest.

    Is it trashy art or arty trash? Who cares? The cinematography is pure heaven. The soundtrack is a buzz (even the moments of total silence rock). And the swimming pool scene? Well...you gotta see it to believe it, man. Still an influence on modern film and music, including albums released in 2011 by Bryan Ferry and Hyperbubble, Alphaville rewards repeated viewings with clues that you can't believe you missed the first time. It's rough, but sweet...brainy, yet fun...totally clich&eacute;d, yet totally imaginative. I cherish every frame. In a world flooded with films created for the purely logical reason of making money, Alphaville's visit from a galaxy where movies are made for the love of film is always welcome.

    How do you spell "Alphaville"? Capital B-O-R-I-N-G! This movie was a sluggish, mind-numbingly dull snore-fest, if I've ever seen one. Set in the future (at an unspecified date), there was absolutely nothing at all "futuristic" about Alphaville in any way, shape, or form. I found Alphaville to basically be a staggeringly pretentious, 1960's, euro-trash mess. Filled with all sorts of idiotic symbolism, it completely lacked a coherent and worthwhile story enough to keep the viewer interested for more than just a few minutes at a time. Considered by many (I don't know why) to be very "avant-garde", Alphaville was directed by French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard who, in the 1960s, was literally churning out about 5 to 6 movies a year. So, just by that alone, you can get a pretty clear picture of exactly how much real thought and care was put into this film's story, its production and its overall character development. If nothing else, Alphaville is a really great sleeping pill that's sure to be of help to any of you frustrated insomniacs out there. Zzzzzzz! Nighty-Night!

    The retro noir elements of ALPHAVILLE: THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF LEMMY CAUTION would eventually be used to even greater effect in BLADE RUNNER (in which Production Design more or less IS the movie); and, in both, the hero falls for a woman created by the technocracy running the galaxy. Suffering, we learn in ALPHAVILLE ("city of whores," where women are tattooed with serial numbers), requires its own religion: "We are totally alone here," intones the Alpha 60: "We are unique, dreadfully unique." "This dump of yours isn't ALPHAville," Caution counters: "It's ZEROville." "What is the privilege of the dead?" the Alpha 60 asks. "To die no more," Caution answers. Alpha 60: "Do you know what illuminates the night?" "Poetry," Caution responds. Useful people are assimilated, unusable ones killed or recycled ("re-educated"). At one point, our hero discovers that the word "conscience" has been deleted from the dictionary. It's an interesting sequence, in which we come to see the correlation between being "conscious" and having a "conscience." Or simply being conscious of conscience... The movie is rife with names like Lemmy Caution, Eckel and Jeckel, and Dr. Nosferatu, etc., and the overly-melodramatic music harks back to the aforementioned films noir- but the incorrect use of the term "light years" makes one wonder if maybe something hasn't been lost in translation.

    I really wanted to like the movie, firstly because I like the new wave of French cinema made in the 60's and secondly, because the plot seemed to be something that would strongly appeal to my cinematographic interests when it comes down to dystopian movies. Being a person that watched quite a few titles throughout his life I must say I was seldom more irritated by a movie like this one that managed to make me turn it off after as little as thirty minutes. I don't really know why Godard didn't manage to pull this off, I suppose that he wasn't entirely aware of what he should be doing in order to create a Orwellian, dictatorship driven, anti utopian movie. It starts off extremely unpromising, as the environment is a patchwork of symbols that were not by any means used in place, not to mention the sound used for the movie was the most inappropriate thriller - like type of sound that they could possibly pick up from just any half - decent crime movie made by the same time. If you manage to neglect the messed up environment that is a patchwork of this and that but never manages to make it up to the full picture that it should represent, there is no possible way you won't get extremely irritated by the computer - generated - Big brother - type of voice that brags nonsense that tries to sound as if it's brainwashing the listener. Beware that this is light-years behind 1984 - a movie, based on a great novel crafted to perfection - a dystopian masterpiece, that I can only praise. After wanting to smash my sound system and after trying to adjust it well enough so the inadequate sound effects won't damage the proper functions of my nerves, I started thinking how this movie would have been a masterpiece if created by Pasolini. I remember how he managed to pull out the entire Theorema using the sound of a church bell, which by no means sounded anywhere that inappropriate as the sound effects found here. Apart from that I do believe he would have done great job in implementing the political meaning into the movie. Godard failed in his attempt to be overly artsy in an environment that was probably chosen by himself - one that managed to fail his movie even more. As a conclusion, with a little bit of sadness I should admit that at least the cover art looks somehow acceptable and pleasant, and that is why I bother to give one star to this hour and a half tape of lost meanings.

    This is the first movie i've seen from this director and i'm completely stunned!!! And i've seen hundreds of different movies, from all genres etc. the idea behind the movie, the destructive (in this case) relation between poetry,love vs straight reason/logic is played brilliantly through out the movie. this relation is played out, almost poetically, i would dare to say. The acting is superb, very convincing in my opinion, i didn't know the actors but they did a very god job. Visually i liked a lot, the flashes through out the movie with the shining lights with the famous Einstein equations didn't bother me at all, it all makes sense. and the computer voice! goddamn it reminded me of Hall 9000 the most bad-ass computer in cinema history, but this one is sinister enough, it's the same concept. It's such a good movie that it's impossible to classify in a genre,i can only put it in the same basket as movies like Dr strange love, 2001 spaceodissey or Apocalypse now, MOVIES THAT TRANSCEND CINEMA AND BECAME PURE WORKS OF ART. Seriously, how can this movie not be present in IMDb top 250? it amazes me very very much. However this is a movie that won't appreciate everyone (romantic-comedy lovers for ex. run for your lives!!) and i can understand it, ART IS A SUBJECTIVE THING AND IN THE END OF IT, IT'S ALWAYS A MATTER OF PERSONAL OPINION. But if you have some imagination, and you like to use it by doing that spectacular process called THINKING, then this is the film for you, a definitively MUST SEE!!! sorry about the English

    Jean-Luc Godard is considered to be one of the top ten directors of all time. He influenced such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Jim Jarmusch, Wong Kar-wai, Wim Wenders,Pier Paolo Pasolini, John Woo, Brian De Palma, and Oliver Stone. In this film, he spoofs typical detective movies. It is certainly one that is designed to get you thinking, as the setting is a controlled society where emotions are banned - banned to the point that they result in a death sentence. Eddie Constantine was perfect in the role of hard-boiled detective in a trench coat and fedora, ala Sam Spade.

    This bizarre but compelling science-fiction noir evokes the uncomfortably accurate future-world of George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadows Patrick McGoohan's TV series THE PRISONER, made shortly afterwards and surely influenced by Godard's movie. The nightmarish totalitarian world of ALPHVILLE, which may be another planet or simply a reworked European superstate, sits well against a backdrop of avant garde 1960s architectural monstrosities. Like cowboy films, Sci-Fi movies always seems to reflect the era in which they are made more strongly that the imagined future in which they are set. ALPHAVILLE strives to be the future but is rooted in the hipness of the mid 60s every bit as securely as BLOW-UP or HELP. Chanderlesque private-eye Lemmy Caution strides through the movie with grim expression and gnarled features, a gun in the pocket of his trench coat and a soul-less girl on every hotel landing ready to tend to his every desire, should he ask her. Normally he simply shoves her away and tells her to clear off! In the midst of vast empty corridors and sparsely-populated offices, with the kind of all pervading surveillance devices that would have been familiar to NUMBER 6 in THE PRISONER, Caution witnesses bizarre ritualistic executions of those who've been 'caught' feeling forbidden emotion....at a swimming pool.... and takes up with the stunningly attractive daughter of the dictator Von Baun, played by Godard's wife, the wonderful Anna Karina. The story is frequently hard to follow and it's political edge is sometimes overbearing but at the denouement, which makes sense and is truly surreal at the same time , it leaves one more intrigued than frustrated and keen to re-watch it. A common trait with Godard's work of the period. Eddie Constantine is really rather well cast as Caution; the lived-in face and gruff persona fit the part. Karina is just gorgeous and the whole film would be worth staying with for her performance alone. She's spell-binding. Not an easy film to watch but one that is often starkly compelling and uncomfortably accurate in foretelling the world we now live in. Viewed now almost 50 years after it was made, ALPHAVILLE is , in it's own way, a film about political correctness and the inevitable slide towards impersonal Super-States and endlessly tightening control.

It's rough, but sweet...brainy, yet fun...totally clich&eacute;d, yet totally imaginative. I cherish every frame. In a world flooded with films created for the purely logical reason of making money, Alphaville's visit from a galaxy where movies are made for the love of film is always welcome.

    How do you spell "Alphaville"? Capital B-O-R-I-N-G! This movie was a sluggish, mind-numbingly dull snore-fest, if I've ever seen one. Set in the future (at an unspecified date), there was absolutely nothing at all "futuristic" about Alphaville in any way, shape, or form. I found Alphaville to basically be a staggeringly pretentious, 1960's, euro-trash mess. Filled with all sorts of idiotic symbolism, it completely lacked a coherent and worthwhile story enough to keep the viewer interested for more than just a few minutes at a time. Considered by many (I don't know why) to be very "avant-garde", Alphaville was directed by French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard who, in the 1960s, was literally churning out about 5 to 6 movies a year. So, just by that alone, you can get a pretty clear picture of exactly how much real thought and care was put into this film's story, its production and its overall character development. If nothing else, Alphaville is a really great sleeping pill that's sure to be of help to any of you frustrated insomniacs out there. Zzzzzzz! Nighty-Night!

    The retro noir elements of ALPHAVILLE: THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF LEMMY CAUTION would eventually be used to even greater effect in BLADE RUNNER (in which Production Design more or less IS the movie); and, in both, the hero falls for a woman created by the technocracy running the galaxy. Suffering, we learn in ALPHAVILLE ("city of whores," where women are tattooed with serial numbers), requires its own religion: "We are totally alone here," intones the Alpha 60: "We are unique, dreadfully unique." "This dump of yours isn't ALPHAville," Caution counters: "It's ZEROville." "What is the privilege of the dead?" the Alpha 60 asks. "To die no more," Caution answers. Alpha 60: "Do you know what illuminates the night?" "Poetry," Caution responds. Useful people are assimilated, unusable ones killed or recycled ("re-educated"). At one point, our hero discovers that the word "conscience" has been deleted from the dictionary. It's an interesting sequence, in which we come to see the correlation between being "conscious" and having a "conscience." Or simply being conscious of conscience... The movie is rife with names like Lemmy Caution, Eckel and Jeckel, and Dr. Nosferatu, etc., and the overly-melodramatic music harks back to the aforementioned films noir- but the incorrect use of the term "light years" makes one wonder if maybe something hasn't been lost in translation.

    I really wanted to like the movie, firstly because I like the new wave of French cinema made in the 60's and secondly, because the plot seemed to be something that would strongly appeal to my cinematographic interests when it comes down to dystopian movies. Being a person that watched quite a few titles throughout his life I must say I was seldom more irritated by a movie like this one that managed to make me turn it off after as little as thirty minutes. I don't really know why Godard didn't manage to pull this off, I suppose that he wasn't entirely aware of what he should be doing in order to create a Orwellian, dictatorship driven, anti utopian movie. It starts off extremely unpromising, as the environment is a patchwork of symbols that were not by any means used in place, not to mention the sound used for the movie was the most inappropriate thriller - like type of sound that they could possibly pick up from just any half - decent crime movie made by the same time. If you manage to neglect the messed up environment that is a patchwork of this and that but never manages to make it up to the full picture that it should represent, there is no possible way you won't get extremely irritated by the computer - generated - Big brother - type of voice that brags nonsense that tries to sound as if it's brainwashing the listener. Beware that this is light-years behind 1984 - a movie, based on a great novel crafted to perfection - a dystopian masterpiece, that I can only praise. After wanting to smash my sound system and after trying to adjust it well enough so the inadequate sound effects won't damage the proper functions of my nerves, I started thinking how this movie would have been a masterpiece if created by Pasolini. I remember how he managed to pull out the entire Theorema using the sound of a church bell, which by no means sounded anywhere that inappropriate as the sound effects found here. Apart from that I do believe he would have done great job in implementing the political meaning into the movie. Godard failed in his attempt to be overly artsy in an environment that was probably chosen by himself - one that managed to fail his movie even more. As a conclusion, with a little bit of sadness I should admit that at least the cover art looks somehow acceptable and pleasant, and that is why I bother to give one star to this hour and a half tape of lost meanings.

    This is the first movie i've seen from this director and i'm completely stunned!!! And i've seen hundreds of different movies, from all genres etc. the idea behind the movie, the destructive (in this case) relation between poetry,love vs straight reason/logic is played brilliantly through out the movie. this relation is played out, almost poetically, i would dare to say. The acting is superb, very convincing in my opinion, i didn't know the actors but they did a very god job. Visually i liked a lot, the flashes through out the movie with the shining lights with the famous Einstein equations didn't bother me at all, it all makes sense. and the computer voice! goddamn it reminded me of Hall 9000 the most bad-ass computer in cinema history, but this one is sinister enough, it's the same concept. It's such a good movie that it's impossible to classify in a genre,i can only put it in the same basket as movies like Dr strange love, 2001 spaceodissey or Apocalypse now, MOVIES THAT TRANSCEND CINEMA AND BECAME PURE WORKS OF ART. Seriously, how can this movie not be present in IMDb top 250? it amazes me very very much. However this is a movie that won't appreciate everyone (romantic-comedy lovers for ex. run for your lives!!) and i can understand it, ART IS A SUBJECTIVE THING AND IN THE END OF IT, IT'S ALWAYS A MATTER OF PERSONAL OPINION. But if you have some imagination, and you like to use it by doing that spectacular process called THINKING, then this is the film for you, a definitively MUST SEE!!! sorry about the English

    Jean-Luc Godard is considered to be one of the top ten directors of all time. He influenced such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Jim Jarmusch, Wong Kar-wai, Wim Wenders,Pier Paolo Pasolini, John Woo, Brian De Palma, and Oliver Stone. In this film, he spoofs typical detective movies. It is certainly one that is designed to get you thinking, as the setting is a controlled society where emotions are banned - banned to the point that they result in a death sentence. Eddie Constantine was perfect in the role of hard-boiled detective in a trench coat and fedora, ala Sam Spade.

    This bizarre but compelling science-fiction noir evokes the uncomfortably accurate future-world of George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadows Patrick McGoohan's TV series THE PRISONER, made shortly afterwards and surely influenced by Godard's movie. The nightmarish totalitarian world of ALPHVILLE, which may be another planet or simply a reworked European superstate, sits well against a backdrop of avant garde 1960s architectural monstrosities. Like cowboy films, Sci-Fi movies always seems to reflect the era in which they are made more strongly that the imagined future in which they are set. ALPHAVILLE strives to be the future but is rooted in the hipness of the mid 60s every bit as securely as BLOW-UP or HELP. Chanderlesque private-eye Lemmy Caution strides through the movie with grim expression and gnarled features, a gun in the pocket of his trench coat and a soul-less girl on every hotel landing ready to tend to his every desire, should he ask her. Normally he simply shoves her away and tells her to clear off! In the midst of vast empty corridors and sparsely-populated offices, with the kind of all pervading surveillance devices that would have been familiar to NUMBER 6 in THE PRISONER, Caution witnesses bizarre ritualistic executions of those who've been 'caught' feeling forbidden emotion....at a swimming pool.... and takes up with the stunningly attractive daughter of the dictator Von Baun, played by Godard's wife, the wonderful Anna Karina. The story is frequently hard to follow and it's political edge is sometimes overbearing but at the denouement, which makes sense and is truly surreal at the same time , it leaves one more intrigued than frustrated and keen to re-watch it. A common trait with Godard's work of the period. Eddie Constantine is really rather well cast as Caution; the lived-in face and gruff persona fit the part. Karina is just gorgeous and the whole film would be worth staying with for her performance alone. She's spell-binding. Not an easy film to watch but one that is often starkly compelling and uncomfortably accurate in foretelling the world we now live in. Viewed now almost 50 years after it was made, ALPHAVILLE is , in it's own way, a film about political correctness and the inevitable slide towards impersonal Super-States and endlessly tightening control.

    From director Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless, aka &Agrave; Bout De souffl&eacute;), this French film was featured in the pages of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I had to see if it was worth that acclaim. Basically American secret agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine), posing under the identity of journalist Ivan Johnson, has come from "The Outlands" to the futuristic city of Alphaville, located on another planet. Despite looking like a regular reporter with a tan overcoat, fedora hat and an Instamatic camera to photograph everything, significant or not, he also carries a pistol and he is on a series of missions. He must search for the missing secret agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); he must capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Prof. Leonard Nosferatu aka Von Braun (Howard Vernon); and he must destroy Alphaville itself, and specifically its dictatorial computer system, Alpha 60. The entire city is controlled by Alpha 60, so all the citizens obey the rules that there will never be any free will, individualism or expressionism, such as poetry, love and true emotion, and they will never ask "why" and will always answer "because", and if these rules are broken they will be interrogated and eliminated, so everyone is essentially a mindless drone. The famous Albert Einstein formula equation E = mc&sup2;, and E = hf, are seen in various places around Alphaville, suggesting a "logical" scientific ruling throughout the city. Caution does Dickson who dies making love to "Seductress Third Class", so he enlists the help of Professor Von Braun's daughter Natacha (Anna Karina), a programmer of Alpha 60, and as time goes by she is unknowingly gaining emotion and going against the rules of the city laws. Caution is caught by the city authorities for ensuing these emotions and ideas in people when it is illegal, and he gets to meet Professor Von Braun who offers him the chance to join Alphaville, maybe even ruling the galaxy, but in the end he of course refuses and destroys the Alpha 60 computer, meaning that the city's population become normal, and he also rescues Natacha who declares she loves him. Also starring L&aacute;szl&oacute; Szab&oacute; as Chief Engineer, Michel Delahaye as Von Braun's Assistant, Jean-Andr&eacute; Fieschi as Prof. Heckell and Jean-Louis Comolli as Prof. Jeckell. The performance by Constantine as the private eye on assignment is suitably world-weary, and everyone else with hardly any expression at all adds to the feeling of a soulless nightmare, it is a good blend of classic film noir and science-fiction together, a most interesting futuristic detective drama. Very good!

    Great plot and idea. Poor visuals due to early years of production. Very weak actors (in my opinion).AND THE MOST ANNOYING- DISTURBING- DISGUSTING-GURGLING-WOBBLING NARRATOR COMPUTER VOICE EVER. It almost destroyed my poor ears during film watching. But luckily, i survived. Sound effects and music design is miserable too, considering the main theme of the movie. Story line of video-film is V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W and have no dynamic scenes at all, but this is common stuff for 60s, 70s movies. Hoping, that Brazil (1985) with similar storyline will be far better! Can't say anything more.

    This film by Jean Luc-Godard is an intentional mixture of the profound and the ridiculous, which is part of its existentialist satirical plan. Eddie Constantine satirizes himself and much else besides as Lemmy Caution, Spy 003 from the Outer Countries who has been sent to Alphaville, the capital of another galaxy. Three years earlier he had already made fun of himself as the archetypal tough guy detective in the spoof film L'EMPIRE DE LA NUIT (THE EMPIRE OF NIGHT, 1962). Since Eddie reached Alphaville (despite its being in another galaxy) by car, we later learn that it can be reached by driving along the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique all night. (For those unfamiliar with Paris, the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique is the Paris ring road.) Eddie disguises himself as Ivan Johnson, a journalist working for the newspaper Figaro-Pravda. For those too young to remember, Pravda was the name of the newspaper of the Soviet Union, and Le Figaro is the conservative newspaper of Paris; the idea of their having merged at this unknown time in the future is one of Godard's dozens of little jokes. Some of the humour was funnier in the sixties than now, but much of it is still amusing. In most scenes, Eddie wears his trenchcoat with the collar turned up and his hat, whether indoors or out. He often flails his automatic pistol in his hand and shoots lots of people to right and to left, who obligingly drop down dead. Godard uses hyper-dramatic music just like what was used in the American films noir of the forties and fifties, and he plays it on purpose at the most inappropriate moments: more intentional hysterical fun. Many of the jokes are of a cinematic nature, so you have to know your movies. The French New Wave directors adored Hitchcock and Hollywood noir films, so the satire is always mixed with homage. Alphaville is populated by futuristic 'mutants' who have moved beyond feelings and follow perfect logic, to form a new perfect species. Anyone who feels anything is executed. There is an amazing scene where a man who dared to grieve when his wife died is machine-gunned to death on a diving board and falls into the swimming pool. Such eruptions of surrealism are common in the film, as are mournful expressions of existentialist anguish narrated on the sound track. Every week, several words such as 'tendresse' ('tenderness') are erased from the Bible (their name for the dictionary of permitted words), and anyone uttering them is executed. No one in Alphaville has ever heard the word 'love' or the word 'conscience'. All women are branded with tattooed numbers like inmates of the Nazi death camps, and all are sex slaves, at least the attractive ones. There are no unattractive women in the film, so perhaps they were also all executed for the offence of being ugly. At the time he made this film, Godard still had talent and had not yet deteriorated into whatever he became twenty years later, when he made what I have described in my review of it as 'the most pretentious film ever made', namely D&Eacute;TECTIVE (1985, see my review). The female lead in this film is the mysterious and alluring Anna Karina, who had many men round the world gasping at that time, although when she gives those long lingering looks in loving closeups she does seem a bit too conscious of her own charms sometimes. But then, that has also been a fault of Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, and female vanity when it becomes visible can be most unsettling, not to say irritating. Karina plays Natacha von Braun, the daughter of Professor von Braun who was expelled to Alphaville in 1964 (the year this film was being made), bringing his daughter with him who is now, in the future, all grown up and beautiful but unable to know how to say those magic words: 'I love you.' However, as she is not really a native of Alphaville, Eddie sees some hope for her. Her father, whom she tells Eddie she has never met, had worked at Los Alamos, and is clearly intended as a reference to the SS officer and rocket scientist Werner von Braun who created the American space programme, though the exact point of the satire concerning this point is lost on me, I am sad to say. Nearly every scene of this film contains interesting lines, either of dialogue or of voice-over, much of it poetry. Among other things, we are told that poetry 'turns darkness into light'. This film, in between all the foolery, is a plea for love, beauty, and poetry. If it did not relentlessly make fun of itself, we might be tempted to say it takes itself too seriously, but it does a balancing act between farce and anguished existentialism, as if Sartre had suddenly become Groucho Marx (and who is to say he never did, or was not all along?) Alphaville is run by a giant computer with 1.4 billion 'nodes', or terminals, called Alpha 60. It has a deep grumbly voice which gives the impression of being several octaves lower than Orson Welles. Alpha 60 wants to wage war on the Outer Countries such as Earth in order to eradicate emotion and feeling, but instead, in the latter part of the film, the inhabitants of Alphaville are all staggering round and falling down dead because of lack of love. Perhaps they did not know whether to laugh or to cry, anymore than we do when watching this, and died of incoherence. (One wonders whether Al-Ghazzali died of it also, or whether he perished from a simple excess of orthodoxy.) The final words spoken in the film are the most important, and confirm our suspicions that this film had a profound and serious purpose, but I cannot reveal them to the uninitiated, any more than I can explain the point of a dagger against the bared chest.

    Is it trashy art or arty trash? Who cares? The cinematography is pure heaven. The soundtrack is a buzz (even the moments of total silence rock). And the swimming pool scene?

The nightmarish totalitarian world of ALPHVILLE, which may be another planet or simply a reworked European superstate, sits well against a backdrop of avant garde 1960s architectural monstrosities. Like cowboy films, Sci-Fi movies always seems to reflect the era in which they are made more strongly that the imagined future in which they are set.

Chanderlesque private-eye Lemmy Caution strides through the movie with grim expression and gnarled features, a gun in the pocket of his trench coat and a soul-less girl on every hotel landing ready to tend to his every desire, should he ask her.

In the midst of vast empty corridors and sparsely-populated offices, with the kind of all pervading surveillance devices that would have been familiar to NUMBER 6 in THE PRISONER, Caution witnesses bizarre ritualistic executions of those who've been 'caught' feeling forbidden emotion....at a swimming pool.... and takes up with the stunningly attractive daughter of the dictator Von Baun, played by Godard's wife, the wonderful Anna Karina. The story is frequently hard to follow and it's political edge is sometimes overbearing but at the denouement, which makes sense and is truly surreal at the same time , it leaves one more intrigued than frustrated and keen to re-watch it. A common trait with Godard's work of the period. Eddie Constantine is really rather well cast as Caution; the lived-in face and gruff persona fit the part. Karina is just gorgeous and the whole film would be worth staying with for her performance alone. She's spell-binding. Not an easy film to watch but one that is often starkly compelling and uncomfortably accurate in foretelling the world we now live in. Viewed now almost 50 years after it was made, ALPHAVILLE is , in it's own way, a film about political correctness and the inevitable slide towards impersonal Super-States and endlessly tightening control.

    From director Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless, aka &Agrave; Bout De souffl&eacute;), this French film was featured in the pages of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I had to see if it was worth that acclaim. Basically American secret agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine), posing under the identity of journalist Ivan Johnson, has come from "The Outlands" to the futuristic city of Alphaville, located on another planet. Despite looking like a regular reporter with a tan overcoat, fedora hat and an Instamatic camera to photograph everything, significant or not, he also carries a pistol and he is on a series of missions. He must search for the missing secret agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); he must capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Prof. Leonard Nosferatu aka Von Braun (Howard Vernon); and he must destroy Alphaville itself, and specifically its dictatorial computer system, Alpha 60. The entire city is controlled by Alpha 60, so all the citizens obey the rules that there will never be any free will, individualism or expressionism, such as poetry, love and true emotion, and they will never ask "why" and will always answer "because", and if these rules are broken they will be interrogated and eliminated, so everyone is essentially a mindless drone. The famous Albert Einstein formula equation E = mc&sup2;, and E = hf, are seen in various places around Alphaville, suggesting a "logical" scientific ruling throughout the city. Caution does Dickson who dies making love to "Seductress Third Class", so he enlists the help of Professor Von Braun's daughter Natacha (Anna Karina), a programmer of Alpha 60, and as time goes by she is unknowingly gaining emotion and going against the rules of the city laws. Caution is caught by the city authorities for ensuing these emotions and ideas in people when it is illegal, and he gets to meet Professor Von Braun who offers him the chance to join Alphaville, maybe even ruling the galaxy, but in the end he of course refuses and destroys the Alpha 60 computer, meaning that the city's population become normal, and he also rescues Natacha who declares she loves him. Also starring L&aacute;szl&oacute; Szab&oacute; as Chief Engineer, Michel Delahaye as Von Braun's Assistant, Jean-Andr&eacute; Fieschi as Prof. Heckell and Jean-Louis Comolli as Prof. Jeckell. The performance by Constantine as the private eye on assignment is suitably world-weary, and everyone else with hardly any expression at all adds to the feeling of a soulless nightmare, it is a good blend of classic film noir and science-fiction together, a most interesting futuristic detective drama. Very good!

    Great plot and idea. Poor visuals due to early years of production. Very weak actors (in my opinion).AND THE MOST ANNOYING- DISTURBING- DISGUSTING-GURGLING-WOBBLING NARRATOR COMPUTER VOICE EVER. It almost destroyed my poor ears during film watching. But luckily, i survived. Sound effects and music design is miserable too, considering the main theme of the movie. Story line of video-film is V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W and have no dynamic scenes at all, but this is common stuff for 60s, 70s movies. Hoping, that Brazil (1985) with similar storyline will be far better! Can't say anything more.

    This film by Jean Luc-Godard is an intentional mixture of the profound and the ridiculous, which is part of its existentialist satirical plan. Eddie Constantine satirizes himself and much else besides as Lemmy Caution, Spy 003 from the Outer Countries who has been sent to Alphaville, the capital of another galaxy. Three years earlier he had already made fun of himself as the archetypal tough guy detective in the spoof film L'EMPIRE DE LA NUIT (THE EMPIRE OF NIGHT, 1962). Since Eddie reached Alphaville (despite its being in another galaxy) by car, we later learn that it can be reached by driving along the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique all night. (For those unfamiliar with Paris, the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique is the Paris ring road.) Eddie disguises himself as Ivan Johnson, a journalist working for the newspaper Figaro-Pravda. For those too young to remember, Pravda was the name of the newspaper of the Soviet Union, and Le Figaro is the conservative newspaper of Paris; the idea of their having merged at this unknown time in the future is one of Godard's dozens of little jokes. Some of the humour was funnier in the sixties than now, but much of it is still amusing. In most scenes, Eddie wears his trenchcoat with the collar turned up and his hat, whether indoors or out. He often flails his automatic pistol in his hand and shoots lots of people to right and to left, who obligingly drop down dead. Godard uses hyper-dramatic music just like what was used in the American films noir of the forties and fifties, and he plays it on purpose at the most inappropriate moments: more intentional hysterical fun. Many of the jokes are of a cinematic nature, so you have to know your movies. The French New Wave directors adored Hitchcock and Hollywood noir films, so the satire is always mixed with homage. Alphaville is populated by futuristic 'mutants' who have moved beyond feelings and follow perfect logic, to form a new perfect species. Anyone who feels anything is executed. There is an amazing scene where a man who dared to grieve when his wife died is machine-gunned to death on a diving board and falls into the swimming pool. Such eruptions of surrealism are common in the film, as are mournful expressions of existentialist anguish narrated on the sound track. Every week, several words such as 'tendresse' ('tenderness') are erased from the Bible (their name for the dictionary of permitted words), and anyone uttering them is executed. No one in Alphaville has ever heard the word 'love' or the word 'conscience'. All women are branded with tattooed numbers like inmates of the Nazi death camps, and all are sex slaves, at least the attractive ones. There are no unattractive women in the film, so perhaps they were also all executed for the offence of being ugly. At the time he made this film, Godard still had talent and had not yet deteriorated into whatever he became twenty years later, when he made what I have described in my review of it as 'the most pretentious film ever made', namely D&Eacute;TECTIVE (1985, see my review). The female lead in this film is the mysterious and alluring Anna Karina, who had many men round the world gasping at that time, although when she gives those long lingering looks in loving closeups she does seem a bit too conscious of her own charms sometimes. But then, that has also been a fault of Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, and female vanity when it becomes visible can be most unsettling, not to say irritating. Karina plays Natacha von Braun, the daughter of Professor von Braun who was expelled to Alphaville in 1964 (the year this film was being made), bringing his daughter with him who is now, in the future, all grown up and beautiful but unable to know how to say those magic words: 'I love you.' However, as she is not really a native of Alphaville, Eddie sees some hope for her. Her father, whom she tells Eddie she has never met, had worked at Los Alamos, and is clearly intended as a reference to the SS officer and rocket scientist Werner von Braun who created the American space programme, though the exact point of the satire concerning this point is lost on me, I am sad to say. Nearly every scene of this film contains interesting lines, either of dialogue or of voice-over, much of it poetry. Among other things, we are told that poetry 'turns darkness into light'. This film, in between all the foolery, is a plea for love, beauty, and poetry. If it did not relentlessly make fun of itself, we might be tempted to say it takes itself too seriously, but it does a balancing act between farce and anguished existentialism, as if Sartre had suddenly become Groucho Marx (and who is to say he never did, or was not all along?) Alphaville is run by a giant computer with 1.4 billion 'nodes', or terminals, called Alpha 60. It has a deep grumbly voice which gives the impression of being several octaves lower than Orson Welles. Alpha 60 wants to wage war on the Outer Countries such as Earth in order to eradicate emotion and feeling, but instead, in the latter part of the film, the inhabitants of Alphaville are all staggering round and falling down dead because of lack of love. Perhaps they did not know whether to laugh or to cry, anymore than we do when watching this, and died of incoherence. (One wonders whether Al-Ghazzali died of it also, or whether he perished from a simple excess of orthodoxy.) The final words spoken in the film are the most important, and confirm our suspicions that this film had a profound and serious purpose, but I cannot reveal them to the uninitiated, any more than I can explain the point of a dagger against the bared chest.

    Is it trashy art or arty trash? Who cares? The cinematography is pure heaven. The soundtrack is a buzz (even the moments of total silence rock). And the swimming pool scene? Well...you gotta see it to believe it, man. Still an influence on modern film and music, including albums released in 2011 by Bryan Ferry and Hyperbubble, Alphaville rewards repeated viewings with clues that you can't believe you missed the first time. It's rough, but sweet...brainy, yet fun...totally clich&eacute;d, yet totally imaginative. I cherish every frame. In a world flooded with films created for the purely logical reason of making money, Alphaville's visit from a galaxy where movies are made for the love of film is always welcome.

    How do you spell "Alphaville"? Capital B-O-R-I-N-G! This movie was a sluggish, mind-numbingly dull snore-fest, if I've ever seen one. Set in the future (at an unspecified date), there was absolutely nothing at all "futuristic" about Alphaville in any way, shape, or form. I found Alphaville to basically be a staggeringly pretentious, 1960's, euro-trash mess. Filled with all sorts of idiotic symbolism, it completely lacked a coherent and worthwhile story enough to keep the viewer interested for more than just a few minutes at a time. Considered by many (I don't know why) to be very "avant-garde", Alphaville was directed by French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard who, in the 1960s, was literally churning out about 5 to 6 movies a year. So, just by that alone, you can get a pretty clear picture of exactly how much real thought and care was put into this film's story, its production and its overall character development. If nothing else, Alphaville is a really great sleeping pill that's sure to be of help to any of you frustrated insomniacs out there. Zzzzzzz! Nighty-Night!

    The retro noir elements of ALPHAVILLE: THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF LEMMY CAUTION would eventually be used to even greater effect in BLADE RUNNER (in which Production Design more or less IS the movie); and, in both, the hero falls for a woman created by the technocracy running the galaxy. Suffering, we learn in ALPHAVILLE ("city of whores," where women are tattooed with serial numbers), requires its own religion: "We are totally alone here," intones the Alpha 60: "We are unique, dreadfully unique." "This dump of yours isn't ALPHAville," Caution counters: "It's ZEROville." "What is the privilege of the dead?" the Alpha 60 asks. "To die no more," Caution answers. Alpha 60: "Do you know what illuminates the night?" "Poetry," Caution responds. Useful people are assimilated, unusable ones killed or recycled ("re-educated"). At one point, our hero discovers that the word "conscience" has been deleted from the dictionary. It's an interesting sequence, in which we come to see the correlation between being "conscious" and having a "conscience." Or simply being conscious of conscience... The movie is rife with names like Lemmy Caution, Eckel and Jeckel, and Dr. Nosferatu, etc., and the overly-melodramatic music harks back to the aforementioned films noir- but the incorrect use of the term "light years" makes one wonder if maybe something hasn't been lost in translation.

    I really wanted to like the movie, firstly because I like the new wave of French cinema made in the 60's and secondly, because the plot seemed to be something that would strongly appeal to my cinematographic interests when it comes down to dystopian movies. Being a person that watched quite a few titles throughout his life I must say I was seldom more irritated by a movie like this one that managed to make me turn it off after as little as thirty minutes. I don't really know why Godard didn't manage to pull this off, I suppose that he wasn't entirely aware of what he should be doing in order to create a Orwellian, dictatorship driven, anti utopian movie. It starts off extremely unpromising, as the environment is a patchwork of symbols that were not by any means used in place, not to mention the sound used for the movie was the most inappropriate thriller - like type of sound that they could possibly pick up from just any half - decent crime movie made by the same time. If you manage to neglect the messed up environment that is a patchwork of this and that but never manages to make it up to the full picture that it should represent, there is no possible way you won't get extremely irritated by the computer - generated - Big brother - type of voice that brags nonsense that tries to sound as if it's brainwashing the listener. Beware that this is light-years behind 1984 - a movie, based on a great novel crafted to perfection - a dystopian masterpiece, that I can only praise. After wanting to smash my sound system and after trying to adjust it well enough so the inadequate sound effects won't damage the proper functions of my nerves, I started thinking how this movie would have been a masterpiece if created by Pasolini. I remember how he managed to pull out the entire Theorema using the sound of a church bell, which by no means sounded anywhere that inappropriate as the sound effects found here. Apart from that I do believe he would have done great job in implementing the political meaning into the movie. Godard failed in his attempt to be overly artsy in an environment that was probably chosen by himself - one that managed to fail his movie even more. As a conclusion, with a little bit of sadness I should admit that at least the cover art looks somehow acceptable and pleasant, and that is why I bother to give one star to this hour and a half tape of lost meanings.

    This is the first movie i've seen from this director and i'm completely stunned!!! And i've seen hundreds of different movies, from all genres etc. the idea behind the movie, the destructive (in this case) relation between poetry,love vs straight reason/logic is played brilliantly through out the movie. this relation is played out, almost poetically, i would dare to say. The acting is superb, very convincing in my opinion, i didn't know the actors but they did a very god job. Visually i liked a lot, the flashes through out the movie with the shining lights with the famous Einstein equations didn't bother me at all, it all makes sense. and the computer voice! goddamn it reminded me of Hall 9000 the most bad-ass computer in cinema history, but this one is sinister enough, it's the same concept. It's such a good movie that it's impossible to classify in a genre,i can only put it in the same basket as movies like Dr strange love, 2001 spaceodissey or Apocalypse now, MOVIES THAT TRANSCEND CINEMA AND BECAME PURE WORKS OF ART. Seriously, how can this movie not be present in IMDb top 250? it amazes me very very much. However this is a movie that won't appreciate everyone (romantic-comedy lovers for ex. run for your lives!!) and i can understand it, ART IS A SUBJECTIVE THING AND IN THE END OF IT, IT'S ALWAYS A MATTER OF PERSONAL OPINION. But if you have some imagination, and you like to use it by doing that spectacular process called THINKING, then this is the film for you, a definitively MUST SEE!!! sorry about the English

    Jean-Luc Godard is considered to be one of the top ten directors of all time. He influenced such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Jim Jarmusch, Wong Kar-wai, Wim Wenders,Pier Paolo Pasolini, John Woo, Brian De Palma, and Oliver Stone. In this film, he spoofs typical detective movies. It is certainly one that is designed to get you thinking, as the setting is a controlled society where emotions are banned - banned to the point that they result in a death sentence. Eddie Constantine was perfect in the role of hard-boiled detective in a trench coat and fedora, ala Sam Spade.

    This bizarre but compelling science-fiction noir evokes the uncomfortably accurate future-world of George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadows Patrick McGoohan's TV series THE PRISONER, made shortly afterwards and surely influenced by Godard's movie. The nightmarish totalitarian world of ALPHVILLE, which may be another planet or simply a reworked European superstate, sits well against a backdrop of avant garde 1960s architectural monstrosities. Like cowboy films, Sci-Fi movies always seems to reflect the era in which they are made more strongly that the imagined future in which they are set. ALPHAVILLE strives to be the future but is rooted in the hipness of the mid 60s every bit as securely as BLOW-UP or HELP. Chanderlesque private-eye Lemmy Caution strides through the movie with grim expression and gnarled features, a gun in the pocket of his trench coat and a soul-less girl on every hotel landing ready to tend to his every desire, should he ask her. Normally he simply shoves her away and tells her to clear off! In the midst of vast empty corridors and sparsely-populated offices, with the kind of all pervading surveillance devices that would have been familiar to NUMBER 6 in THE PRISONER, Caution witnesses bizarre ritualistic executions of those who've been 'caught' feeling forbidden emotion....at a swimming pool.... and takes up with the stunningly attractive daughter of the dictator Von Baun, played by Godard's wife, the wonderful Anna Karina. The story is frequently hard to follow and it's political edge is sometimes overbearing but at the denouement, which makes sense and is truly surreal at the same time , it leaves one more intrigued than frustrated and keen to re-watch it. A common trait with Godard's work of the period. Eddie Constantine is really rather well cast as Caution; the lived-in face and gruff persona fit the part. Karina is just gorgeous and the whole film would be worth staying with for her performance alone. She's spell-binding. Not an easy film to watch but one that is often starkly compelling and uncomfortably accurate in foretelling the world we now live in. Viewed now almost 50 years after it was made, ALPHAVILLE is , in it's own way, a film about political correctness and the inevitable slide towards impersonal Super-States and endlessly tightening control.

Alpha 60 wants to wage war on the Outer Countries such as Earth in order to eradicate emotion and feeling, but instead, in the latter part of the film, the inhabitants of Alphaville are all staggering round and falling down dead because of lack of love. Perhaps they did not know whether to laugh or to cry, anymore than we do when watching this, and died of incoherence. (One wonders whether Al-Ghazzali died of it also, or whether he perished from a simple excess of orthodoxy.) The final words spoken in the film are the most important, and confirm our suspicions that this film had a profound and serious purpose, but I cannot reveal them to the uninitiated, any more than I can explain the point of a dagger against the bared chest.

    Is it trashy art or arty trash? Who cares? The cinematography is pure heaven. The soundtrack is a buzz (even the moments of total silence rock). And the swimming pool scene? Well...you gotta see it to believe it, man. Still an influence on modern film and music, including albums released in 2011 by Bryan Ferry and Hyperbubble, Alphaville rewards repeated viewings with clues that you can't believe you missed the first time. It's rough, but sweet...brainy, yet fun...totally clich&eacute;d, yet totally imaginative. I cherish every frame. In a world flooded with films created for the purely logical reason of making money, Alphaville's visit from a galaxy where movies are made for the love of film is always welcome.

    How do you spell "Alphaville"? Capital B-O-R-I-N-G! This movie was a sluggish, mind-numbingly dull snore-fest, if I've ever seen one. Set in the future (at an unspecified date), there was absolutely nothing at all "futuristic" about Alphaville in any way, shape, or form. I found Alphaville to basically be a staggeringly pretentious, 1960's, euro-trash mess. Filled with all sorts of idiotic symbolism, it completely lacked a coherent and worthwhile story enough to keep the viewer interested for more than just a few minutes at a time. Considered by many (I don't know why) to be very "avant-garde", Alphaville was directed by French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard who, in the 1960s, was literally churning out about 5 to 6 movies a year. So, just by that alone, you can get a pretty clear picture of exactly how much real thought and care was put into this film's story, its production and its overall character development. If nothing else, Alphaville is a really great sleeping pill that's sure to be of help to any of you frustrated insomniacs out there. Zzzzzzz! Nighty-Night!

    The retro noir elements of ALPHAVILLE: THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF LEMMY CAUTION would eventually be used to even greater effect in BLADE RUNNER (in which Production Design more or less IS the movie); and, in both, the hero falls for a woman created by the technocracy running the galaxy. Suffering, we learn in ALPHAVILLE ("city of whores," where women are tattooed with serial numbers), requires its own religion: "We are totally alone here," intones the Alpha 60: "We are unique, dreadfully unique." "This dump of yours isn't ALPHAville," Caution counters: "It's ZEROville." "What is the privilege of the dead?" the Alpha 60 asks. "To die no more," Caution answers. Alpha 60: "Do you know what illuminates the night?" "Poetry," Caution responds. Useful people are assimilated, unusable ones killed or recycled ("re-educated"). At one point, our hero discovers that the word "conscience" has been deleted from the dictionary. It's an interesting sequence, in which we come to see the correlation between being "conscious" and having a "conscience." Or simply being conscious of conscience... The movie is rife with names like Lemmy Caution, Eckel and Jeckel, and Dr. Nosferatu, etc., and the overly-melodramatic music harks back to the aforementioned films noir- but the incorrect use of the term "light years" makes one wonder if maybe something hasn't been lost in translation.

    I really wanted to like the movie, firstly because I like the new wave of French cinema made in the 60's and secondly, because the plot seemed to be something that would strongly appeal to my cinematographic interests when it comes down to dystopian movies. Being a person that watched quite a few titles throughout his life I must say I was seldom more irritated by a movie like this one that managed to make me turn it off after as little as thirty minutes. I don't really know why Godard didn't manage to pull this off, I suppose that he wasn't entirely aware of what he should be doing in order to create a Orwellian, dictatorship driven, anti utopian movie. It starts off extremely unpromising, as the environment is a patchwork of symbols that were not by any means used in place, not to mention the sound used for the movie was the most inappropriate thriller - like type of sound that they could possibly pick up from just any half - decent crime movie made by the same time. If you manage to neglect the messed up environment that is a patchwork of this and that but never manages to make it up to the full picture that it should represent, there is no possible way you won't get extremely irritated by the computer - generated - Big brother - type of voice that brags nonsense that tries to sound as if it's brainwashing the listener. Beware that this is light-years behind 1984 - a movie, based on a great novel crafted to perfection - a dystopian masterpiece, that I can only praise. After wanting to smash my sound system and after trying to adjust it well enough so the inadequate sound effects won't damage the proper functions of my nerves, I started thinking how this movie would have been a masterpiece if created by Pasolini. I remember how he managed to pull out the entire Theorema using the sound of a church bell, which by no means sounded anywhere that inappropriate as the sound effects found here. Apart from that I do believe he would have done great job in implementing the political meaning into the movie. Godard failed in his attempt to be overly artsy in an environment that was probably chosen by himself - one that managed to fail his movie even more. As a conclusion, with a little bit of sadness I should admit that at least the cover art looks somehow acceptable and pleasant, and that is why I bother to give one star to this hour and a half tape of lost meanings.

    This is the first movie i've seen from this director and i'm completely stunned!!! And i've seen hundreds of different movies, from all genres etc. the idea behind the movie, the destructive (in this case) relation between poetry,love vs straight reason/logic is played brilliantly through out the movie. this relation is played out, almost poetically, i would dare to say. The acting is superb, very convincing in my opinion, i didn't know the actors but they did a very god job. Visually i liked a lot, the flashes through out the movie with the shining lights with the famous Einstein equations didn't bother me at all, it all makes sense. and the computer voice! goddamn it reminded me of Hall 9000 the most bad-ass computer in cinema history, but this one is sinister enough, it's the same concept. It's such a good movie that it's impossible to classify in a genre,i can only put it in the same basket as movies like Dr strange love, 2001 spaceodissey or Apocalypse now, MOVIES THAT TRANSCEND CINEMA AND BECAME PURE WORKS OF ART. Seriously, how can this movie not be present in IMDb top 250? it amazes me very very much. However this is a movie that won't appreciate everyone (romantic-comedy lovers for ex. run for your lives!!) and i can understand it, ART IS A SUBJECTIVE THING AND IN THE END OF IT, IT'S ALWAYS A MATTER OF PERSONAL OPINION. But if you have some imagination, and you like to use it by doing that spectacular process called THINKING, then this is the film for you, a definitively MUST SEE!!! sorry about the English

    Jean-Luc Godard is considered to be one of the top ten directors of all time. He influenced such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Jim Jarmusch, Wong Kar-wai, Wim Wenders,Pier Paolo Pasolini, John Woo, Brian De Palma, and Oliver Stone. In this film, he spoofs typical detective movies. It is certainly one that is designed to get you thinking, as the setting is a controlled society where emotions are banned - banned to the point that they result in a death sentence. Eddie Constantine was perfect in the role of hard-boiled detective in a trench coat and fedora, ala Sam Spade.

    This bizarre but compelling science-fiction noir evokes the uncomfortably accurate future-world of George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadows Patrick McGoohan's TV series THE PRISONER, made shortly afterwards and surely influenced by Godard's movie. The nightmarish totalitarian world of ALPHVILLE, which may be another planet or simply a reworked European superstate, sits well against a backdrop of avant garde 1960s architectural monstrosities. Like cowboy films, Sci-Fi movies always seems to reflect the era in which they are made more strongly that the imagined future in which they are set. ALPHAVILLE strives to be the future but is rooted in the hipness of the mid 60s every bit as securely as BLOW-UP or HELP. Chanderlesque private-eye Lemmy Caution strides through the movie with grim expression and gnarled features, a gun in the pocket of his trench coat and a soul-less girl on every hotel landing ready to tend to his every desire, should he ask her. Normally he simply shoves her away and tells her to clear off! In the midst of vast empty corridors and sparsely-populated offices, with the kind of all pervading surveillance devices that would have been familiar to NUMBER 6 in THE PRISONER, Caution witnesses bizarre ritualistic executions of those who've been 'caught' feeling forbidden emotion....at a swimming pool.... and takes up with the stunningly attractive daughter of the dictator Von Baun, played by Godard's wife, the wonderful Anna Karina. The story is frequently hard to follow and it's political edge is sometimes overbearing but at the denouement, which makes sense and is truly surreal at the same time , it leaves one more intrigued than frustrated and keen to re-watch it. A common trait with Godard's work of the period. Eddie Constantine is really rather well cast as Caution; the lived-in face and gruff persona fit the part. Karina is just gorgeous and the whole film would be worth staying with for her performance alone. She's spell-binding. Not an easy film to watch but one that is often starkly compelling and uncomfortably accurate in foretelling the world we now live in. Viewed now almost 50 years after it was made, ALPHAVILLE is , in it's own way, a film about political correctness and the inevitable slide towards impersonal Super-States and endlessly tightening control.

    From director Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless, aka &Agrave; Bout De souffl&eacute;), this French film was featured in the pages of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I had to see if it was worth that acclaim. Basically American secret agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine), posing under the identity of journalist Ivan Johnson, has come from "The Outlands" to the futuristic city of Alphaville, located on another planet. Despite looking like a regular reporter with a tan overcoat, fedora hat and an Instamatic camera to photograph everything, significant or not, he also carries a pistol and he is on a series of missions. He must search for the missing secret agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); he must capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Prof. Leonard Nosferatu aka Von Braun (Howard Vernon); and he must destroy Alphaville itself, and specifically its dictatorial computer system, Alpha 60. The entire city is controlled by Alpha 60, so all the citizens obey the rules that there will never be any free will, individualism or expressionism, such as poetry, love and true emotion, and they will never ask "why" and will always answer "because", and if these rules are broken they will be interrogated and eliminated, so everyone is essentially a mindless drone. The famous Albert Einstein formula equation E = mc&sup2;, and E = hf, are seen in various places around Alphaville, suggesting a "logical" scientific ruling throughout the city. Caution does Dickson who dies making love to "Seductress Third Class", so he enlists the help of Professor Von Braun's daughter Natacha (Anna Karina), a programmer of Alpha 60, and as time goes by she is unknowingly gaining emotion and going against the rules of the city laws. Caution is caught by the city authorities for ensuing these emotions and ideas in people when it is illegal, and he gets to meet Professor Von Braun who offers him the chance to join Alphaville, maybe even ruling the galaxy, but in the end he of course refuses and destroys the Alpha 60 computer, meaning that the city's population become normal, and he also rescues Natacha who declares she loves him. Also starring L&aacute;szl&oacute; Szab&oacute; as Chief Engineer, Michel Delahaye as Von Braun's Assistant, Jean-Andr&eacute; Fieschi as Prof. Heckell and Jean-Louis Comolli as Prof. Jeckell. The performance by Constantine as the private eye on assignment is suitably world-weary, and everyone else with hardly any expression at all adds to the feeling of a soulless nightmare, it is a good blend of classic film noir and science-fiction together, a most interesting futuristic detective drama. Very good!

    Great plot and idea. Poor visuals due to early years of production. Very weak actors (in my opinion).AND THE MOST ANNOYING- DISTURBING- DISGUSTING-GURGLING-WOBBLING NARRATOR COMPUTER VOICE EVER. It almost destroyed my poor ears during film watching. But luckily, i survived. Sound effects and music design is miserable too, considering the main theme of the movie. Story line of video-film is V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W and have no dynamic scenes at all, but this is common stuff for 60s, 70s movies. Hoping, that Brazil (1985) with similar storyline will be far better! Can't say anything more.

    This film by Jean Luc-Godard is an intentional mixture of the profound and the ridiculous, which is part of its existentialist satirical plan. Eddie Constantine satirizes himself and much else besides as Lemmy Caution, Spy 003 from the Outer Countries who has been sent to Alphaville, the capital of another galaxy. Three years earlier he had already made fun of himself as the archetypal tough guy detective in the spoof film L'EMPIRE DE LA NUIT (THE EMPIRE OF NIGHT, 1962). Since Eddie reached Alphaville (despite its being in another galaxy) by car, we later learn that it can be reached by driving along the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique all night. (For those unfamiliar with Paris, the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique is the Paris ring road.) Eddie disguises himself as Ivan Johnson, a journalist working for the newspaper Figaro-Pravda. For those too young to remember, Pravda was the name of the newspaper of the Soviet Union, and Le Figaro is the conservative newspaper of Paris; the idea of their having merged at this unknown time in the future is one of Godard's dozens of little jokes. Some of the humour was funnier in the sixties than now, but much of it is still amusing. In most scenes, Eddie wears his trenchcoat with the collar turned up and his hat, whether indoors or out. He often flails his automatic pistol in his hand and shoots lots of people to right and to left, who obligingly drop down dead. Godard uses hyper-dramatic music just like what was used in the American films noir of the forties and fifties, and he plays it on purpose at the most inappropriate moments: more intentional hysterical fun. Many of the jokes are of a cinematic nature, so you have to know your movies. The French New Wave directors adored Hitchcock and Hollywood noir films, so the satire is always mixed with homage. Alphaville is populated by futuristic 'mutants' who have moved beyond feelings and follow perfect logic, to form a new perfect species. Anyone who feels anything is executed. There is an amazing scene where a man who dared to grieve when his wife died is machine-gunned to death on a diving board and falls into the swimming pool. Such eruptions of surrealism are common in the film, as are mournful expressions of existentialist anguish narrated on the sound track. Every week, several words such as 'tendresse' ('tenderness') are erased from the Bible (their name for the dictionary of permitted words), and anyone uttering them is executed. No one in Alphaville has ever heard the word 'love' or the word 'conscience'. All women are branded with tattooed numbers like inmates of the Nazi death camps, and all are sex slaves, at least the attractive ones. There are no unattractive women in the film, so perhaps they were also all executed for the offence of being ugly. At the time he made this film, Godard still had talent and had not yet deteriorated into whatever he became twenty years later, when he made what I have described in my review of it as 'the most pretentious film ever made', namely D&Eacute;TECTIVE (1985, see my review). The female lead in this film is the mysterious and alluring Anna Karina, who had many men round the world gasping at that time, although when she gives those long lingering looks in loving closeups she does seem a bit too conscious of her own charms sometimes. But then, that has also been a fault of Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, and female vanity when it becomes visible can be most unsettling, not to say irritating. Karina plays Natacha von Braun, the daughter of Professor von Braun who was expelled to Alphaville in 1964 (the year this film was being made), bringing his daughter with him who is now, in the future, all grown up and beautiful but unable to know how to say those magic words: 'I love you.' However, as she is not really a native of Alphaville, Eddie sees some hope for her. Her father, whom she tells Eddie she has never met, had worked at Los Alamos, and is clearly intended as a reference to the SS officer and rocket scientist Werner von Braun who created the American space programme, though the exact point of the satire concerning this point is lost on me, I am sad to say. Nearly every scene of this film contains interesting lines, either of dialogue or of voice-over, much of it poetry. Among other things, we are told that poetry 'turns darkness into light'. This film, in between all the foolery, is a plea for love, beauty, and poetry. If it did not relentlessly make fun of itself, we might be tempted to say it takes itself too seriously, but it does a balancing act between farce and anguished existentialism, as if Sartre had suddenly become Groucho Marx (and who is to say he never did, or was not all along?) Alphaville is run by a giant computer with 1.4 billion 'nodes', or terminals, called Alpha 60. It has a deep grumbly voice which gives the impression of being several octaves lower than Orson Welles. Alpha 60 wants to wage war on the Outer Countries such as Earth in order to eradicate emotion and feeling, but instead, in the latter part of the film, the inhabitants of Alphaville are all staggering round and falling down dead because of lack of love. Perhaps they did not know whether to laugh or to cry, anymore than we do when watching this, and died of incoherence. (One wonders whether Al-Ghazzali died of it also, or whether he perished from a simple excess of orthodoxy.) The final words spoken in the film are the most important, and confirm our suspicions that this film had a profound and serious purpose, but I cannot reveal them to the uninitiated, any more than I can explain the point of a dagger against the bared chest.

    This bizarre but compelling science-fiction noir evokes the uncomfortably accurate future-world of George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadows Patrick McGoohan's TV series THE PRISONER, made shortly afterwards and surely influenced by Godard's movie. The nightmarish totalitarian world of ALPHVILLE, which may be another planet or simply a reworked European superstate, sits well against a backdrop of avant garde 1960s architectural monstrosities. Like cowboy films, Sci-Fi movies always seems to reflect the era in which they are made more strongly that the imagined future in which they are set. ALPHAVILLE strives to be the future but is rooted in the hipness of the mid 60s every bit as securely as BLOW-UP or HELP. Chanderlesque private-eye Lemmy Caution strides through the movie with grim expression and gnarled features, a gun in the pocket of his trench coat and a soul-less girl on every hotel landing ready to tend to his every desire, should he ask her. Normally he simply shoves her away and tells her to clear off! In the midst of vast empty corridors and sparsely-populated offices, with the kind of all pervading surveillance devices that would have been familiar to NUMBER 6 in THE PRISONER, Caution witnesses bizarre ritualistic executions of those who've been 'caught' feeling forbidden emotion....at a swimming pool.... and takes up with the stunningly attractive daughter of the dictator Von Baun, played by Godard's wife, the wonderful Anna Karina. The story is frequently hard to follow and it's political edge is sometimes overbearing but at the denouement, which makes sense and is truly surreal at the same time , it leaves one more intrigued than frustrated and keen to re-watch it. A common trait with Godard's work of the period. Eddie Constantine is really rather well cast as Caution; the lived-in face and gruff persona fit the part. Karina is just gorgeous and the whole film would be worth staying with for her performance alone. She's spell-binding. Not an easy film to watch but one that is often starkly compelling and uncomfortably accurate in foretelling the world we now live in. Viewed now almost 50 years after it was made, ALPHAVILLE is , in it's own way, a film about political correctness and the inevitable slide towards impersonal Super-States and endlessly tightening control.

    From director Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless, aka &Agrave; Bout De souffl&eacute;), this French film was featured in the pages of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I had to see if it was worth that acclaim. Basically American secret agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine), posing under the identity of journalist Ivan Johnson, has come from "The Outlands" to the futuristic city of Alphaville, located on another planet. Despite looking like a regular reporter with a tan overcoat, fedora hat and an Instamatic camera to photograph everything, significant or not, he also carries a pistol and he is on a series of missions. He must search for the missing secret agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); he must capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Prof. Leonard Nosferatu aka Von Braun (Howard Vernon); and he must destroy Alphaville itself, and specifically its dictatorial computer system, Alpha 60. The entire city is controlled by Alpha 60, so all the citizens obey the rules that there will never be any free will, individualism or expressionism, such as poetry, love and true emotion, and they will never ask "why" and will always answer "because", and if these rules are broken they will be interrogated and eliminated, so everyone is essentially a mindless drone. The famous Albert Einstein formula equation E = mc&sup2;, and E = hf, are seen in various places around Alphaville, suggesting a "logical" scientific ruling throughout the city. Caution does Dickson who dies making love to "Seductress Third Class", so he enlists the help of Professor Von Braun's daughter Natacha (Anna Karina), a programmer of Alpha 60, and as time goes by she is unknowingly gaining emotion and going against the rules of the city laws. Caution is caught by the city authorities for ensuing these emotions and ideas in people when it is illegal, and he gets to meet Professor Von Braun who offers him the chance to join Alphaville, maybe even ruling the galaxy, but in the end he of course refuses and destroys the Alpha 60 computer, meaning that the city's population become normal, and he also rescues Natacha who declares she loves him. Also starring L&aacute;szl&oacute; Szab&oacute; as Chief Engineer, Michel Delahaye as Von Braun's Assistant, Jean-Andr&eacute; Fieschi as Prof. Heckell and Jean-Louis Comolli as Prof. Jeckell. The performance by Constantine as the private eye on assignment is suitably world-weary, and everyone else with hardly any expression at all adds to the feeling of a soulless nightmare, it is a good blend of classic film noir and science-fiction together, a most interesting futuristic detective drama. Very good!

    Great plot and idea. Poor visuals due to early years of production. Very weak actors (in my opinion).AND THE MOST ANNOYING- DISTURBING- DISGUSTING-GURGLING-WOBBLING NARRATOR COMPUTER VOICE EVER. It almost destroyed my poor ears during film watching. But luckily, i survived. Sound effects and music design is miserable too, considering the main theme of the movie. Story line of video-film is V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W and have no dynamic scenes at all, but this is common stuff for 60s, 70s movies. Hoping, that Brazil (1985) with similar storyline will be far better! Can't say anything more.

    This film by Jean Luc-Godard is an intentional mixture of the profound and the ridiculous, which is part of its existentialist satirical plan. Eddie Constantine satirizes himself and much else besides as Lemmy Caution, Spy 003 from the Outer Countries who has been sent to Alphaville, the capital of another galaxy. Three years earlier he had already made fun of himself as the archetypal tough guy detective in the spoof film L'EMPIRE DE LA NUIT (THE EMPIRE OF NIGHT, 1962). Since Eddie reached Alphaville (despite its being in another galaxy) by car, we later learn that it can be reached by driving along the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique all night. (For those unfamiliar with Paris, the Boulevard P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique is the Paris ring road.) Eddie disguises himself as Ivan Johnson, a journalist working for the newspaper Figaro-Pravda. For those too young to remember, Pravda was the name of the newspaper of the Soviet Union, and Le Figaro is the conservative newspaper of Paris; the idea of their having merged at this unknown time in the future is one of Godard's dozens of little jokes. Some of the humour was funnier in the sixties than now, but much of it is still amusing. In most scenes, Eddie wears his trenchcoat with the collar turned up and his hat, whether indoors or out. He often flails his automatic pistol in his hand and shoots lots of people to right and to left, who obligingly drop down dead. Godard uses hyper-dramatic music just like what was used in the American films noir of the forties and fifties, and he plays it on purpose at the most inappropriate moments: more intentional hysterical fun. Many of the jokes are of a cinematic nature, so you have to know your movies. The French New Wave directors adored Hitchcock and Hollywood noir films, so the satire is always mixed with homage. Alphaville is populated by futuristic 'mutants' who have moved beyond feelings and follow perfect logic, to form a new perfect species. Anyone who feels anything is executed. There is an amazing scene where a man who dared to grieve when his wife died is machine-gunned to death on a diving board and falls into the swimming pool. Such eruptions of surrealism are common in the film, as are mournful expressions of existentialist anguish narrated on the sound track. Every week, several words such as 'tendresse' ('tenderness') are erased from the Bible (their name for the dictionary of permitted words), and anyone uttering them is executed. No one in Alphaville has ever heard the word 'love' or the word 'conscience'. All women are branded with tattooed numbers like inmates of the Nazi death camps, and all are sex slaves, at least the attractive ones. There are no unattractive women in the film, so perhaps they were also all executed for the offence of being ugly. At the time he made this film, Godard still had talent and had not yet deteriorated into whatever he became twenty years later, when he made what I have described in my review of it as 'the most pretentious film ever made', namely D&Eacute;TECTIVE (1985, see my review). The female lead in this film is the mysterious and alluring Anna Karina, who had many men round the world gasping at that time, although when she gives those long lingering looks in loving closeups she does seem a bit too conscious of her own charms sometimes. But then, that has also been a fault of Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, and female vanity when it becomes visible can be most unsettling, not to say irritating. Karina plays Natacha von Braun, the daughter of Professor von Braun who was expelled to Alphaville in 1964 (the year this film was being made), bringing his daughter with him who is now, in the future, all grown up and beautiful but unable to know how to say those magic words: 'I love you.' However, as she is not really a native of Alphaville, Eddie sees some hope for her. Her father, whom she tells Eddie she has never met, had worked at Los Alamos, and is clearly intended as a reference to the SS officer and rocket scientist Werner von Braun who created the American space programme, though the exact point of the satire concerning this point is lost on me, I am sad to say. Nearly every scene of this film contains interesting lines, either of dialogue or of voice-over, much of it poetry. Among other things, we are told that poetry 'turns darkness into light'. This film, in between all the foolery, is a plea for love, beauty, and poetry. If it did not relentlessly make fun of itself, we might be tempted to say it takes itself too seriously, but it does a balancing act between farce and anguished existentialism, as if Sartre had suddenly become Groucho Marx (and who is to say he never did, or was not all along?) Alphaville is run by a giant computer with 1.4 billion 'nodes', or terminals, called Alpha 60. It has a deep grumbly voice which gives the impression of being several octaves lower than Orson Welles. Alpha 60 wants to wage war on the Outer Countries such as Earth in order to eradicate emotion and feeling, but instead, in the latter part of the film, the inhabitants of Alphaville are all staggering round and falling down dead because of lack of love. Perhaps they did not know whether to laugh or to cry, anymore than we do when watching this, and died of incoherence. (One wonders whether Al-Ghazzali died of it also, or whether he perished from a simple excess of orthodoxy.) The final words spoken in the film are the most important, and confirm our suspicions that this film had a profound and serious purpose, but I cannot reveal them to the uninitiated, any more than I can explain the point of a dagger against the bared chest.

    Is it trashy art or arty trash? Who cares? The cinematography is pure heaven. The soundtrack is a buzz (even the moments of total silence rock). And the swimming pool scene? Well...you gotta see it to believe it, man. Still an influence on modern film and music, including albums released in 2011 by Bryan Ferry and Hyperbubble, Alphaville rewards repeated viewings with clues that you can't believe you missed the first time. It's rough, but sweet...brainy, yet fun...totally clich&eacute;d, yet totally imaginative. I cherish every frame. In a world flooded with films created for the purely logical reason of making money, Alphaville's visit from a galaxy where movies are made for the love of film is always welcome.

    How do you spell "Alphaville"? Capital B-O-R-I-N-G! This movie was a sluggish, mind-numbingly dull snore-fest, if I've ever seen one. Set in the future (at an unspecified date), there was absolutely nothing at all "futuristic" about Alphaville in any way, shape, or form. I found Alphaville to basically be a staggeringly pretentious, 1960's, euro-trash mess. Filled with all sorts of idiotic symbolism, it completely lacked a coherent and worthwhile story enough to keep the viewer interested for more than just a few minutes at a time. Considered by many (I don't know why) to be very "avant-garde", Alphaville was directed by French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard who, in the 1960s, was literally churning out about 5 to 6 movies a year. So, just by that alone, you can get a pretty clear picture of exactly how much real thought and care was put into this film's story, its production and its overall character development. If nothing else, Alphaville is a really great sleeping pill that's sure to be of help to any of you frustrated insomniacs out there. Zzzzzzz! Nighty-Night!

    The retro noir elements of ALPHAVILLE: THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF LEMMY CAUTION would eventually be used to even greater effect in BLADE RUNNER (in which Production Design more or less IS the movie); and, in both, the hero falls for a woman created by the technocracy running the galaxy. Suffering, we learn in ALPHAVILLE ("city of whores," where women are tattooed with serial numbers), requires its own religion: "We are totally alone here," intones the Alpha 60: "We are unique, dreadfully unique." "This dump of yours isn't ALPHAville," Caution counters: "It's ZEROville." "What is the privilege of the dead?" the Alpha 60 asks. "To die no more," Caution answers. Alpha 60: "Do you know what illuminates the night?" "Poetry," Caution responds. Useful people are assimilated, unusable ones killed or recycled ("re-educated"). At one point, our hero discovers that the word "conscience" has been deleted from the dictionary. It's an interesting sequence, in which we come to see the correlation between being "conscious" and having a "conscience." Or simply being conscious of conscience... The movie is rife with names like Lemmy Caution, Eckel and Jeckel, and Dr. Nosferatu, etc., and the overly-melodramatic music harks back to the aforementioned films noir- but the incorrect use of the term "light years" makes one wonder if maybe something hasn't been lost in translation.

    I really wanted to like the movie, firstly because I like the new wave of French cinema made in the 60's and secondly, because the plot seemed to be something that would strongly appeal to my cinematographic interests when it comes down to dystopian movies. Being a person that watched quite a few titles throughout his life I must say I was seldom more irritated by a movie like this one that managed to make me turn it off after as little as thirty minutes. I don't really know why Godard didn't manage to pull this off, I suppose that he wasn't entirely aware of what he should be doing in order to create a Orwellian, dictatorship driven, anti utopian movie. It starts off extremely unpromising, as the environment is a patchwork of symbols that were not by any means used in place, not to mention the sound used for the movie was the most inappropriate thriller - like type of sound that they could possibly pick up from just any half - decent crime movie made by the same time. If you manage to neglect the messed up environment that is a patchwork of this and that but never manages to make it up to the full picture that it should represent, there is no possible way you won't get extremely irritated by the computer - generated - Big brother - type of voice that brags nonsense that tries to sound as if it's brainwashing the listener. Beware that this is light-years behind 1984 - a movie, based on a great novel crafted to perfection - a dystopian masterpiece, that I can only praise. After wanting to smash my sound system and after trying to adjust it well enough so the inadequate sound effects won't damage the proper functions of my nerves, I started thinking how this movie would have been a masterpiece if created by Pasolini. I remember how he managed to pull out the entire Theorema using the sound of a church bell, which by no means sounded anywhere that inappropriate as the sound effects found here. Apart from that I do believe he would have done great job in implementing the political meaning into the movie. Godard failed in his attempt to be overly artsy in an environment that was probably chosen by himself - one that managed to fail his movie even more. As a conclusion, with a little bit of sadness I should admit that at least the cover art looks somehow acceptable and pleasant, and that is why I bother to give one star to this hour and a half tape of lost meanings.

    This is the first movie i've seen from this director and i'm completely stunned!!! And i've seen hundreds of different movies, from all genres etc. the idea behind the movie, the destructive (in this case) relation between poetry,love vs straight reason/logic is played brilliantly through out the movie. this relation is played out, almost poetically, i would dare to say. The acting is superb, very convincing in my opinion, i didn't know the actors but they did a very god job. Visually i liked a lot, the flashes through out the movie with the shining lights with the famous Einstein equations didn't bother me at all, it all makes sense. and the computer voice! goddamn it reminded me of Hall 9000 the most bad-ass computer in cinema history, but this one is sinister enough, it's the same concept. It's such a good movie that it's impossible to classify in a genre,i can only put it in the same basket as movies like Dr strange love, 2001 spaceodissey or Apocalypse now, MOVIES THAT TRANSCEND CINEMA AND BECAME PURE WORKS OF ART. Seriously, how can this movie not be present in IMDb top 250? it amazes me very very much. However this is a movie that won't appreciate everyone (romantic-comedy lovers for ex. run for your lives!!) and i can understand it, ART IS A SUBJECTIVE THING AND IN THE END OF IT, IT'S ALWAYS A MATTER OF PERSONAL OPINION. But if you have some imagination, and you like to use it by doing that spectacular process called THINKING, then this is the film for you, a definitively MUST SEE!!! sorry about the English

    Jean-Luc Godard is considered to be one of the top ten directors of all time. He influenced such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Jim Jarmusch, Wong Kar-wai, Wim Wenders,Pier Paolo Pasolini, John Woo, Brian De Palma, and Oliver Stone. In this film, he spoofs typical detective movies. It is certainly one that is designed to get you thinking, as the setting is a controlled society where emotions are banned - banned to the point that they result in a death sentence. Eddie Constantine was perfect in the role of hard-boiled detective in a trench coat and fedora, ala Sam Spade.
