    Wim Wenders's Paris,Texas is a film that is narrated through road trips. An utterly lost man (in every sense of the word) is tracked down by his brother and reunited with his son. On discovering a part of his old self, the man takes on a journey to bring his son back with his estranged mother. What the viewer doesn't know till the very end of the movie is as to why this family had been separated in the first place. The film's pace is quite in contrast to that of the fast and frequent road trips on screen. Although the slowness and did get to my head at times, I found the film quite riveting on the whole. The barren roads of Texas contrasted against the busy highways of Houston is an interesting feature of this film. At heart, "Paris, Texas" is an intense film about human separation and more importantly, reunion.

    Wenders, M&uuml;ller, Shepard, Cooder, Stanton, Stockwell. Could there be a better combination  and concentration!  of talent? Film is indeed poetry, and this is one of the most beautiful poems of parenthood I've seen. Not explicit, preachy, but otherworldly, subtle, comic, bittersweet. The alienation from one's own self, all of this internal, has its visual counterpoint first in the concept of walkabout in the open space, the desert, the quiet; then in the urbanity of modern life, the closed space, the airplane, the noise. Change, both internal and external (appearance such as the rugged beard, mutism), reflected in the road movie. His self-discovery is actually our discovery, not only of him but of the movie. Travis has two beginnings: as explained by him, he was most likely conceived in Paris, Texas. It was his first beginning, the film his second. Stanton is sublime. His ability to convey meaning and emotion through the slightest gestures and expressions is unprecedented. And yet, at the same time, his ability to conceal meaning and emotion is just as evocatively effective  his face is a blank, his eyes devoid of anything one might connect to, finding meaning from. That lunch they're having together before hitting the road, father and son, somehow reifies the film's many narratives for me. There we have the walkabout/journey/highway and family/loss/past at an intersection. And it's a perfectly beautiful moment.

    First of all i just want to say WOW,what a great movie. I,ve seen a lot of them and this one just blew my mind completely. The beginning is a marvelous opening with Ry Cooder's wonderful blues guitar (it is one of the best soundtrack's iv'e ever heard). And who's that? Well if it isn't the presence of Harry Dean Stanton in his best role to this day(the performance is really captivating),as he wanders to the path of nothing in the lonely desert. He soon makes his way in to a bar and passes out,and thats when the movie "begins" if you know what i mean. The man we just saw has no name,no past,nothing. Soon the doctor that takes him in finds a number which is his brother(Dean Stockwell). The brother rushes down to the deserts of Texas and finds a hurting and scarred man with no life in him. One of the many brilliant things about this movie is that Stanton doesn't say a word until 20 minutes in to this film,and you get to do some real character study of him in this time. We soon find out Stanton has a son and that his brother has taken care of him for the years Stanton's been gone. When they arrive to LA,many things happen very quickly for Stanton. He meets the son that doesn't remember him(Hunter Carson),Stockwells wife(Aurore Clement in one of her best roles,i haven't seen her in much,and she deserves more,because she is a very good actor) and later,when they see film clips,we find out that Stanton also has a long lost wife in which he remembers. But Carson and Stanton really hit it off as father and son in a memorable 3 minutes where Stanton jokes around with the Son. Stanton is determined to find the wife but only hear rumors of where she is which is that she is working in Houston.Pretty shockingly,Stanton and Carson make there way to Houston without telling Stockwell or Clement. The finest scene of ALL,is when Stanton finds The wife(Nastassja Kinski in such a gripping and flawless performance that makes this movie a masterpiece). There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computer,and the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie. Everything about it is great,the cinematography,the acting,the soundtrack,the melancholic "thing" about it.It is really worth it.

    Four years after going missing Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out of the vast South Texas desert. After collapsing in a saloon a doctor treats him and discovers his brother's business card in his wallet. Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) flies to Texas to meet his brother and has many questions for him. Travis appears to be mute however and doesn't eat, sleep or talk for days. When he finally opens his mouth it is revealed that he remembers little about the last four years. Dean takes Travis back to his L.A. home where he and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been looking after Travis' seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson) since Travis' wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) left him with them and disappeared herself. Travis has to try and re-assimilate himself back into every day life and reconnect with his young son before setting out to try and find his estranged wife. In many ways this film reminded me of director Wim Wenders 1976 film Kings of the Road. Both films take place mostly on the road in quiet, almost desolate places with two characters who barely know each other. This film is more about the family unit and loss but is equally as good. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes as well as numerous other prizes and it's fantastic. The story is tremendous. It was written by noted playwright/actor Sam Shepard and is a wonderful tale of isolation, loss and redemption. It unfolds at an incredibly slow pace by modern standards but is thoroughly gripping, divulging enough to keep you on tenterhooks but never telling you everything. I was completely gripped the whole way through. As well as a great plot the films other standout feature is its score which is performed on the slide guitar by Ry Cooper. It is haunting and repetitive but in a good way. It worked very well with the plot and the on screen visuals which were also exemplary. Frequent Wenders cinematographer Robby Muller creates some stunning sights of wide open, desolate vistas and intricate and interesting internal shots of bars, motels and houses. Some of the shots seem to last for minutes but that is part of what makes it so beautiful. The film is a joy to look at. On the acting side the film is once again terrific. Harry Dean Stanton is superb when playing the mute in early scenes but becomes more vocal as the film progresses. His performance overall was brilliant. His son, played by Hunter Carson was also excellent in his first film role, although he looked unnervingly like a young Jodie Foster. Supporting actors Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clement and especially Nastassja Kinski were also without fault. This is a film which might not appeal to everyone due to its slow nature but I loved it. I was mesmerised by the long, single camera shots in which the dialogue just went on and on and the cinematography was breathtaking. This isn't far off a perfect film and one that I'd recommend to anyone as long as their favourite film wasn't Transformers 2. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    the film starts slowly, keeping pace with Travis, who is wandering the desert aimlessly on foot. Travis has been a lost drifter for 4 years in the Mojave Desert and now appears to be mute, probably from suffering severe mental trauma, until his brother eventually found him and convinced him to go back home in LA. upon his arrival, Travis is gonna try to get his life together, reconnect with his son and brother and maybe right some wrongs from the past. Travis seems to come out of nowhere, and heading nowhere and at the end of the film, he disappears into the night, to an unknown destination.. since the beginning, there's a sentiment of coming back to the origins of cinema; i've read a review on the film that pointed out how Travis's journey responds to the evolution of American cinema (German director Wim Wenders's fascination for American cinema is obvious, as the very title of the film refers metaphorically to the Europe-USA rapport), and i can see how that's true seeing as Travis and the film go gradually from silence to speech, from open vast landscapes to more enclosed spaces defined by doors and walls, from desert to peep-show booths. Paris-Texas provides the possibility to see raw reality, uncategorized. Travis does not see the world as a coherent system that he's implicated to, but rather as a succession of moments and he's the spectator, which implies loneliness and alienation. the viewer follows with sincere emotion the journey of a father and a husband, lost in his past and searching for identity. the film is drenched in highly engaging, bittersweet atmosphere, arranged remarkably by the cinematography and the beautiful slide guitar score setting the mood. inducing touching scenes of characters communicating on an honest level, and one truly great scene in Travis's and Jane's conversation, the film represents the perfect balance between a good script, images of such beauty that they become paintings, actors that give life to their characters and music that goes so well that it becomes the shadow of the images. one of the most moving films i've seen.

    I regret watching this movie. The characters and performances are shallow and irritating. The cinematography is nice, but the direction is bland, substance-less and devoid of style. I understand that a lot of people who feel inclined to review Paris, Texas are so inclined because they really like the movie. ... but having just watched it, partially based on seeing so many gushing reviews here, I really feel that a contrary review is in order. My friend and I both just watched it and both regret it. Here are some of our mutual favorites, for reference, so you know who we are: In A Lonely Place, Chinatown, Brazil, Taxi Driver, Maltese Falcon, Blue Velvet, Stroszek, Persona... We both agree that Paris, Texas is THE most regrettable viewing experience we have shared. For additional reference of what this ranking means to us I will list other things we've watched besides our favorites, all of which we regret less (if at all) than Paris, Texas: The Quatermass Trilogy, Dune, High Sierra, Aquaboy cartoons, Melancholia, Plan 9 from Outer Space, the Sinister Urge, Gates of Heaven... I would say that if you happen to be one of the folks who will end up liking this movie, then you would have a good feeling after watching the first bit of it. But if you start watching it and feel irritable after only 15 minutes, you should stop watching it because that's the movie. That is what I wish I had heard from a trusted source several hours ago.

    Great. My first review. It's too bad I start with Paris, Texas because I have only one word for it: BORING. I watched a few hours earlier Coen's The Man Who Wasn't There. So, with a very good state of mind, I got to watch Paris, Texas, mostly because of the good reviews. The beginning was good: nice frames, clean and wide views in the country and a mysterious man with no past. I thought that should be watchable. I was mistaken. After an hour I had to go to sleep. I thought I was tired, but it was the movie. I didn't like Travis at all. No intellect. I see people like him everyday and they're no surprise. His kid is even smarter than him. If the intention was to see a simple man's life with his simple man's decisions then the film makers succeeded. But I think this recipe is for 5 year old's. Luckily there is a Forward button and I watched the predictable ending. 5 is merely for cinematography and a few good melodramatic scenes.

    Throughout the entirety of Paris, Texas's two-and-a-half-hour running time (and not one minute of it wasted), it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears, he's animalistic, not talking, motivated only by his strange, unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires, but there's always that wild, uncertain edge to his performance, so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character, as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle -- the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon, the story of his own conception, the falsity of a peep show, the million artificial lights of Los Angeles, and the obsession that gives the film its name, the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries, but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions, and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again, seeing his son end ex-wife embrace from a distance. Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering. All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are, for the most part, films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris, Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly.

    The depictions of America that most fascinate me have been carried out by Europeans. What stories we find in these ventures never really probe deep into actual life, which is often a facsimile concocted from outside knowledge, but they are a suitable excuse for the journey that transports out of the safe, familiar reaches. It's probably best if we don't use for example Zabriskie Point as a faithful blueprint for its turbulent era, but once it sets out for the desert? For Leone it was about the world (mirrored in the rugged faces) as the blank slate upon which a tapestry of fictions are enacted; myths presaging the passing of that world. With Melville  in Magnet of Doom - it was the road trip through the Deep South where we get to know little but see a lot. Herzog in Stroszek, where chickens confound us. Polanski made the most American film of all, working from a script by Robert Towne, but his Chinatown extends a little beyond the familiar reaches of neo-noir into the untravelled; dusty orange groves and acquifers late at night. Each in their peculiar way reveal a little of the fabric of the larger world. And it's always tied up to the landscape, always the landscape that draws us in, big and small. The endless stretch of asphalt through sunbaked desert, the motel's neon sign flashing against purpleorange horizons. A gas station in the middle of nowhere. I understand that these are the familiar sights of everyday commute for a sizeable portion of Americans, or a short drive away from home, but for us on the other side they are the source of endless allure - aptly, a world most of us Europeans have known through movies. It's not about the gas station then, but about the 'middle of nowhere'  a valuable space of contemplation missing from the Old Europe dissicated under so much time and history. Having sampled the familiar moviescapes of Los Angeles or Texas, these films often take to the desert, a further retreat towards the hermitage where a clear vision is possible. Wenders's film is true to all these things. He begins from the desert and emerges back into the known world, meaning whatever communion with the vastness took place is already behind us. Tellingly, the rugged protagonist emerges mute. The very title is about two worlds (of which there are many in the film), and the attempt to bridge the endless inbetween. The 'slice of life' is about familiar contrivance, like out of daytime soap. But something tells me the film didn't sweep the French at Cannes for its moral dilemmas, the French who so valued the escape into the dream world of noir and western 50 years ago. The moviescapes, again as perceived from the other side; rural America bathed in luminous phantasmagoria, a gas station filmed in bright reds and lime greens. Or a suburban landscape so amazingly bland, as it unfolds from behind the windshield of a moving car. That amazing cat house, itself a mysterious house of fictions where two worlds are brought together in disguise. It could have been quite something if Wenders understood how a frame functions. He knows how to set them up, but not quite what they do. Inside the cat house, for example, the corridor lined-up with curtains each granting passage  one of the most inspired codas of cinematic self-reference. Wenders instead gives us long monologues, he explains too much that we don't need to know. I understand that he values emotional consonance - where I differ, is that I'm drawn towards films that operate or dismantle at the level of perception rather than feeling. It's good though, as artifice breathing life into cinematic space. As a piece of abstract soul, seen through the road darkly.

    'Paris, Texas', mind you, is not edge-of-the-seat viewing. It is not thrill-a-minute cinema; neither will your adrenaline be activated every 5 or 10 minutes. It is a slow, introspective study, through the interplay of just 5 characters, of solitude, and loneliness, and its gradual fading away ... of the ingratiation of the archetypal 'outsider' into the fold of mankind, once again ... even if, at the end, the wheel turns full circle ... Harry Dean Stanton, even if he underplays his role to textbook perfection, straddles the film like a colossus from start to finish. A complex character if there ever was one, it is Stanton's triumph that he imbues it with shades which make it more comprehensible and less dense ... and the mercurial Natassja Kinski, who gets barely half an hour of screen time, lights it up as only she can. The penultimate scene between the two (I won't reveal the details here) provides one of the most intense picturizations of the husband-wife relationship that I, at least, have seen. So far as performances go, it would be unfair not to put in a word for the adorable Hunter Henderson, who plays the couple's son Hunter, and illumines every scene he is in. And yet, perhaps, 'Paris, Texas' would not have been what it is without Ry Cooder's haunting background score ... perhaps the greatest example of the use of the guitar in the background music of any film, to devastating effect. Not popcorn viewing for sure, but if you're in the mood for serious, affecting cinema, don't miss 'Paris, Texas'.

    Four years after going missing Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out of the vast South Texas desert. After collapsing in a saloon a doctor treats him and discovers his brother's business card in his wallet.

Supporting actors Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clement and especially Nastassja Kinski were also without fault. This is a film which might not appeal to everyone due to its slow nature but I loved it. I was mesmerised by the long, single camera shots in which the dialogue just went on and on and the cinematography was breathtaking. This isn't far off a perfect film and one that I'd recommend to anyone as long as their favourite film wasn't Transformers 2. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    the film starts slowly, keeping pace with Travis, who is wandering the desert aimlessly on foot. Travis has been a lost drifter for 4 years in the Mojave Desert and now appears to be mute, probably from suffering severe mental trauma, until his brother eventually found him and convinced him to go back home in LA. upon his arrival, Travis is gonna try to get his life together, reconnect with his son and brother and maybe right some wrongs from the past. Travis seems to come out of nowhere, and heading nowhere and at the end of the film, he disappears into the night, to an unknown destination.. since the beginning, there's a sentiment of coming back to the origins of cinema; i've read a review on the film that pointed out how Travis's journey responds to the evolution of American cinema (German director Wim Wenders's fascination for American cinema is obvious, as the very title of the film refers metaphorically to the Europe-USA rapport), and i can see how that's true seeing as Travis and the film go gradually from silence to speech, from open vast landscapes to more enclosed spaces defined by doors and walls, from desert to peep-show booths. Paris-Texas provides the possibility to see raw reality, uncategorized. Travis does not see the world as a coherent system that he's implicated to, but rather as a succession of moments and he's the spectator, which implies loneliness and alienation. the viewer follows with sincere emotion the journey of a father and a husband, lost in his past and searching for identity. the film is drenched in highly engaging, bittersweet atmosphere, arranged remarkably by the cinematography and the beautiful slide guitar score setting the mood. inducing touching scenes of characters communicating on an honest level, and one truly great scene in Travis's and Jane's conversation, the film represents the perfect balance between a good script, images of such beauty that they become paintings, actors that give life to their characters and music that goes so well that it becomes the shadow of the images. one of the most moving films i've seen.

    I regret watching this movie. The characters and performances are shallow and irritating. The cinematography is nice, but the direction is bland, substance-less and devoid of style. I understand that a lot of people who feel inclined to review Paris, Texas are so inclined because they really like the movie. ... but having just watched it, partially based on seeing so many gushing reviews here, I really feel that a contrary review is in order. My friend and I both just watched it and both regret it. Here are some of our mutual favorites, for reference, so you know who we are: In A Lonely Place, Chinatown, Brazil, Taxi Driver, Maltese Falcon, Blue Velvet, Stroszek, Persona... We both agree that Paris, Texas is THE most regrettable viewing experience we have shared. For additional reference of what this ranking means to us I will list other things we've watched besides our favorites, all of which we regret less (if at all) than Paris, Texas: The Quatermass Trilogy, Dune, High Sierra, Aquaboy cartoons, Melancholia, Plan 9 from Outer Space, the Sinister Urge, Gates of Heaven... I would say that if you happen to be one of the folks who will end up liking this movie, then you would have a good feeling after watching the first bit of it. But if you start watching it and feel irritable after only 15 minutes, you should stop watching it because that's the movie. That is what I wish I had heard from a trusted source several hours ago.

    Great. My first review. It's too bad I start with Paris, Texas because I have only one word for it: BORING. I watched a few hours earlier Coen's The Man Who Wasn't There. So, with a very good state of mind, I got to watch Paris, Texas, mostly because of the good reviews. The beginning was good: nice frames, clean and wide views in the country and a mysterious man with no past. I thought that should be watchable. I was mistaken. After an hour I had to go to sleep. I thought I was tired, but it was the movie. I didn't like Travis at all. No intellect. I see people like him everyday and they're no surprise. His kid is even smarter than him. If the intention was to see a simple man's life with his simple man's decisions then the film makers succeeded. But I think this recipe is for 5 year old's. Luckily there is a Forward button and I watched the predictable ending. 5 is merely for cinematography and a few good melodramatic scenes.

    Throughout the entirety of Paris, Texas's two-and-a-half-hour running time (and not one minute of it wasted), it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears, he's animalistic, not talking, motivated only by his strange, unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires, but there's always that wild, uncertain edge to his performance, so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character, as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle -- the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon, the story of his own conception, the falsity of a peep show, the million artificial lights of Los Angeles, and the obsession that gives the film its name, the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries, but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions, and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again, seeing his son end ex-wife embrace from a distance. Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering. All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are, for the most part, films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris, Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly.

    The depictions of America that most fascinate me have been carried out by Europeans. What stories we find in these ventures never really probe deep into actual life, which is often a facsimile concocted from outside knowledge, but they are a suitable excuse for the journey that transports out of the safe, familiar reaches. It's probably best if we don't use for example Zabriskie Point as a faithful blueprint for its turbulent era, but once it sets out for the desert? For Leone it was about the world (mirrored in the rugged faces) as the blank slate upon which a tapestry of fictions are enacted; myths presaging the passing of that world. With Melville  in Magnet of Doom - it was the road trip through the Deep South where we get to know little but see a lot. Herzog in Stroszek, where chickens confound us. Polanski made the most American film of all, working from a script by Robert Towne, but his Chinatown extends a little beyond the familiar reaches of neo-noir into the untravelled; dusty orange groves and acquifers late at night. Each in their peculiar way reveal a little of the fabric of the larger world. And it's always tied up to the landscape, always the landscape that draws us in, big and small. The endless stretch of asphalt through sunbaked desert, the motel's neon sign flashing against purpleorange horizons. A gas station in the middle of nowhere. I understand that these are the familiar sights of everyday commute for a sizeable portion of Americans, or a short drive away from home, but for us on the other side they are the source of endless allure - aptly, a world most of us Europeans have known through movies. It's not about the gas station then, but about the 'middle of nowhere'  a valuable space of contemplation missing from the Old Europe dissicated under so much time and history. Having sampled the familiar moviescapes of Los Angeles or Texas, these films often take to the desert, a further retreat towards the hermitage where a clear vision is possible. Wenders's film is true to all these things. He begins from the desert and emerges back into the known world, meaning whatever communion with the vastness took place is already behind us. Tellingly, the rugged protagonist emerges mute. The very title is about two worlds (of which there are many in the film), and the attempt to bridge the endless inbetween. The 'slice of life' is about familiar contrivance, like out of daytime soap. But something tells me the film didn't sweep the French at Cannes for its moral dilemmas, the French who so valued the escape into the dream world of noir and western 50 years ago. The moviescapes, again as perceived from the other side; rural America bathed in luminous phantasmagoria, a gas station filmed in bright reds and lime greens. Or a suburban landscape so amazingly bland, as it unfolds from behind the windshield of a moving car. That amazing cat house, itself a mysterious house of fictions where two worlds are brought together in disguise. It could have been quite something if Wenders understood how a frame functions. He knows how to set them up, but not quite what they do. Inside the cat house, for example, the corridor lined-up with curtains each granting passage  one of the most inspired codas of cinematic self-reference. Wenders instead gives us long monologues, he explains too much that we don't need to know. I understand that he values emotional consonance - where I differ, is that I'm drawn towards films that operate or dismantle at the level of perception rather than feeling. It's good though, as artifice breathing life into cinematic space. As a piece of abstract soul, seen through the road darkly.

    'Paris, Texas', mind you, is not edge-of-the-seat viewing. It is not thrill-a-minute cinema; neither will your adrenaline be activated every 5 or 10 minutes. It is a slow, introspective study, through the interplay of just 5 characters, of solitude, and loneliness, and its gradual fading away ... of the ingratiation of the archetypal 'outsider' into the fold of mankind, once again ... even if, at the end, the wheel turns full circle ... Harry Dean Stanton, even if he underplays his role to textbook perfection, straddles the film like a colossus from start to finish. A complex character if there ever was one, it is Stanton's triumph that he imbues it with shades which make it more comprehensible and less dense ... and the mercurial Natassja Kinski, who gets barely half an hour of screen time, lights it up as only she can. The penultimate scene between the two (I won't reveal the details here) provides one of the most intense picturizations of the husband-wife relationship that I, at least, have seen. So far as performances go, it would be unfair not to put in a word for the adorable Hunter Henderson, who plays the couple's son Hunter, and illumines every scene he is in. And yet, perhaps, 'Paris, Texas' would not have been what it is without Ry Cooder's haunting background score ... perhaps the greatest example of the use of the guitar in the background music of any film, to devastating effect. Not popcorn viewing for sure, but if you're in the mood for serious, affecting cinema, don't miss 'Paris, Texas'.

    Wim Wenders's Paris,Texas is a film that is narrated through road trips. An utterly lost man (in every sense of the word) is tracked down by his brother and reunited with his son. On discovering a part of his old self, the man takes on a journey to bring his son back with his estranged mother. What the viewer doesn't know till the very end of the movie is as to why this family had been separated in the first place. The film's pace is quite in contrast to that of the fast and frequent road trips on screen. Although the slowness and did get to my head at times, I found the film quite riveting on the whole. The barren roads of Texas contrasted against the busy highways of Houston is an interesting feature of this film. At heart, "Paris, Texas" is an intense film about human separation and more importantly, reunion.

    Wenders, M&uuml;ller, Shepard, Cooder, Stanton, Stockwell. Could there be a better combination  and concentration!  of talent? Film is indeed poetry, and this is one of the most beautiful poems of parenthood I've seen. Not explicit, preachy, but otherworldly, subtle, comic, bittersweet. The alienation from one's own self, all of this internal, has its visual counterpoint first in the concept of walkabout in the open space, the desert, the quiet; then in the urbanity of modern life, the closed space, the airplane, the noise. Change, both internal and external (appearance such as the rugged beard, mutism), reflected in the road movie. His self-discovery is actually our discovery, not only of him but of the movie. Travis has two beginnings: as explained by him, he was most likely conceived in Paris, Texas. It was his first beginning, the film his second. Stanton is sublime. His ability to convey meaning and emotion through the slightest gestures and expressions is unprecedented. And yet, at the same time, his ability to conceal meaning and emotion is just as evocatively effective  his face is a blank, his eyes devoid of anything one might connect to, finding meaning from. That lunch they're having together before hitting the road, father and son, somehow reifies the film's many narratives for me. There we have the walkabout/journey/highway and family/loss/past at an intersection. And it's a perfectly beautiful moment.

    First of all i just want to say WOW,what a great movie. I,ve seen a lot of them and this one just blew my mind completely. The beginning is a marvelous opening with Ry Cooder's wonderful blues guitar (it is one of the best soundtrack's iv'e ever heard). And who's that? Well if it isn't the presence of Harry Dean Stanton in his best role to this day(the performance is really captivating),as he wanders to the path of nothing in the lonely desert. He soon makes his way in to a bar and passes out,and thats when the movie "begins" if you know what i mean. The man we just saw has no name,no past,nothing. Soon the doctor that takes him in finds a number which is his brother(Dean Stockwell). The brother rushes down to the deserts of Texas and finds a hurting and scarred man with no life in him. One of the many brilliant things about this movie is that Stanton doesn't say a word until 20 minutes in to this film,and you get to do some real character study of him in this time. We soon find out Stanton has a son and that his brother has taken care of him for the years Stanton's been gone. When they arrive to LA,many things happen very quickly for Stanton. He meets the son that doesn't remember him(Hunter Carson),Stockwells wife(Aurore Clement in one of her best roles,i haven't seen her in much,and she deserves more,because she is a very good actor) and later,when they see film clips,we find out that Stanton also has a long lost wife in which he remembers. But Carson and Stanton really hit it off as father and son in a memorable 3 minutes where Stanton jokes around with the Son. Stanton is determined to find the wife but only hear rumors of where she is which is that she is working in Houston.Pretty shockingly,Stanton and Carson make there way to Houston without telling Stockwell or Clement. The finest scene of ALL,is when Stanton finds The wife(Nastassja Kinski in such a gripping and flawless performance that makes this movie a masterpiece). There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computer,and the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie. Everything about it is great,the cinematography,the acting,the soundtrack,the melancholic "thing" about it.It is really worth it.

    Four years after going missing Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out of the vast South Texas desert. After collapsing in a saloon a doctor treats him and discovers his brother's business card in his wallet. Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) flies to Texas to meet his brother and has many questions for him. Travis appears to be mute however and doesn't eat, sleep or talk for days. When he finally opens his mouth it is revealed that he remembers little about the last four years. Dean takes Travis back to his L.A. home where he and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been looking after Travis' seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson) since Travis' wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) left him with them and disappeared herself. Travis has to try and re-assimilate himself back into every day life and reconnect with his young son before setting out to try and find his estranged wife. In many ways this film reminded me of director Wim Wenders 1976 film Kings of the Road. Both films take place mostly on the road in quiet, almost desolate places with two characters who barely know each other. This film is more about the family unit and loss but is equally as good. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes as well as numerous other prizes and it's fantastic. The story is tremendous. It was written by noted playwright/actor Sam Shepard and is a wonderful tale of isolation, loss and redemption. It unfolds at an incredibly slow pace by modern standards but is thoroughly gripping, divulging enough to keep you on tenterhooks but never telling you everything. I was completely gripped the whole way through. As well as a great plot the films other standout feature is its score which is performed on the slide guitar by Ry Cooper. It is haunting and repetitive but in a good way. It worked very well with the plot and the on screen visuals which were also exemplary. Frequent Wenders cinematographer Robby Muller creates some stunning sights of wide open, desolate vistas and intricate and interesting internal shots of bars, motels and houses. Some of the shots seem to last for minutes but that is part of what makes it so beautiful. The film is a joy to look at. On the acting side the film is once again terrific. Harry Dean Stanton is superb when playing the mute in early scenes but becomes more vocal as the film progresses. His performance overall was brilliant. His son, played by Hunter Carson was also excellent in his first film role, although he looked unnervingly like a young Jodie Foster. Supporting actors Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clement and especially Nastassja Kinski were also without fault. This is a film which might not appeal to everyone due to its slow nature but I loved it. I was mesmerised by the long, single camera shots in which the dialogue just went on and on and the cinematography was breathtaking. This isn't far off a perfect film and one that I'd recommend to anyone as long as their favourite film wasn't Transformers 2. www.attheback.blogspot.com

Wenders's film is true to all these things. He begins from the desert and emerges back into the known world, meaning whatever communion with the vastness took place is already behind us. Tellingly, the rugged protagonist emerges mute. The very title is about two worlds (of which there are many in the film), and the attempt to bridge the endless inbetween. The 'slice of life' is about familiar contrivance, like out of daytime soap. But something tells me the film didn't sweep the French at Cannes for its moral dilemmas, the French who so valued the escape into the dream world of noir and western 50 years ago. The moviescapes, again as perceived from the other side; rural America bathed in luminous phantasmagoria, a gas station filmed in bright reds and lime greens. Or a suburban landscape so amazingly bland, as it unfolds from behind the windshield of a moving car. That amazing cat house, itself a mysterious house of fictions where two worlds are brought together in disguise. It could have been quite something if Wenders understood how a frame functions. He knows how to set them up, but not quite what they do. Inside the cat house, for example, the corridor lined-up with curtains each granting passage  one of the most inspired codas of cinematic self-reference. Wenders instead gives us long monologues, he explains too much that we don't need to know. I understand that he values emotional consonance - where I differ, is that I'm drawn towards films that operate or dismantle at the level of perception rather than feeling. It's good though, as artifice breathing life into cinematic space. As a piece of abstract soul, seen through the road darkly.

    'Paris, Texas', mind you, is not edge-of-the-seat viewing. It is not thrill-a-minute cinema; neither will your adrenaline be activated every 5 or 10 minutes. It is a slow, introspective study, through the interplay of just 5 characters, of solitude, and loneliness, and its gradual fading away ... of the ingratiation of the archetypal 'outsider' into the fold of mankind, once again ... even if, at the end, the wheel turns full circle ... Harry Dean Stanton, even if he underplays his role to textbook perfection, straddles the film like a colossus from start to finish. A complex character if there ever was one, it is Stanton's triumph that he imbues it with shades which make it more comprehensible and less dense ... and the mercurial Natassja Kinski, who gets barely half an hour of screen time, lights it up as only she can. The penultimate scene between the two (I won't reveal the details here) provides one of the most intense picturizations of the husband-wife relationship that I, at least, have seen. So far as performances go, it would be unfair not to put in a word for the adorable Hunter Henderson, who plays the couple's son Hunter, and illumines every scene he is in. And yet, perhaps, 'Paris, Texas' would not have been what it is without Ry Cooder's haunting background score ... perhaps the greatest example of the use of the guitar in the background music of any film, to devastating effect. Not popcorn viewing for sure, but if you're in the mood for serious, affecting cinema, don't miss 'Paris, Texas'.

    Wim Wenders's Paris,Texas is a film that is narrated through road trips. An utterly lost man (in every sense of the word) is tracked down by his brother and reunited with his son. On discovering a part of his old self, the man takes on a journey to bring his son back with his estranged mother. What the viewer doesn't know till the very end of the movie is as to why this family had been separated in the first place. The film's pace is quite in contrast to that of the fast and frequent road trips on screen. Although the slowness and did get to my head at times, I found the film quite riveting on the whole. The barren roads of Texas contrasted against the busy highways of Houston is an interesting feature of this film. At heart, "Paris, Texas" is an intense film about human separation and more importantly, reunion.

    Wenders, M&uuml;ller, Shepard, Cooder, Stanton, Stockwell. Could there be a better combination  and concentration!  of talent? Film is indeed poetry, and this is one of the most beautiful poems of parenthood I've seen. Not explicit, preachy, but otherworldly, subtle, comic, bittersweet. The alienation from one's own self, all of this internal, has its visual counterpoint first in the concept of walkabout in the open space, the desert, the quiet; then in the urbanity of modern life, the closed space, the airplane, the noise. Change, both internal and external (appearance such as the rugged beard, mutism), reflected in the road movie. His self-discovery is actually our discovery, not only of him but of the movie. Travis has two beginnings: as explained by him, he was most likely conceived in Paris, Texas. It was his first beginning, the film his second. Stanton is sublime. His ability to convey meaning and emotion through the slightest gestures and expressions is unprecedented. And yet, at the same time, his ability to conceal meaning and emotion is just as evocatively effective  his face is a blank, his eyes devoid of anything one might connect to, finding meaning from. That lunch they're having together before hitting the road, father and son, somehow reifies the film's many narratives for me. There we have the walkabout/journey/highway and family/loss/past at an intersection. And it's a perfectly beautiful moment.

    First of all i just want to say WOW,what a great movie. I,ve seen a lot of them and this one just blew my mind completely. The beginning is a marvelous opening with Ry Cooder's wonderful blues guitar (it is one of the best soundtrack's iv'e ever heard). And who's that? Well if it isn't the presence of Harry Dean Stanton in his best role to this day(the performance is really captivating),as he wanders to the path of nothing in the lonely desert. He soon makes his way in to a bar and passes out,and thats when the movie "begins" if you know what i mean. The man we just saw has no name,no past,nothing. Soon the doctor that takes him in finds a number which is his brother(Dean Stockwell). The brother rushes down to the deserts of Texas and finds a hurting and scarred man with no life in him. One of the many brilliant things about this movie is that Stanton doesn't say a word until 20 minutes in to this film,and you get to do some real character study of him in this time. We soon find out Stanton has a son and that his brother has taken care of him for the years Stanton's been gone. When they arrive to LA,many things happen very quickly for Stanton. He meets the son that doesn't remember him(Hunter Carson),Stockwells wife(Aurore Clement in one of her best roles,i haven't seen her in much,and she deserves more,because she is a very good actor) and later,when they see film clips,we find out that Stanton also has a long lost wife in which he remembers. But Carson and Stanton really hit it off as father and son in a memorable 3 minutes where Stanton jokes around with the Son. Stanton is determined to find the wife but only hear rumors of where she is which is that she is working in Houston.Pretty shockingly,Stanton and Carson make there way to Houston without telling Stockwell or Clement. The finest scene of ALL,is when Stanton finds The wife(Nastassja Kinski in such a gripping and flawless performance that makes this movie a masterpiece). There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computer,and the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie. Everything about it is great,the cinematography,the acting,the soundtrack,the melancholic "thing" about it.It is really worth it.

    Four years after going missing Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out of the vast South Texas desert. After collapsing in a saloon a doctor treats him and discovers his brother's business card in his wallet. Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) flies to Texas to meet his brother and has many questions for him. Travis appears to be mute however and doesn't eat, sleep or talk for days. When he finally opens his mouth it is revealed that he remembers little about the last four years. Dean takes Travis back to his L.A. home where he and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been looking after Travis' seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson) since Travis' wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) left him with them and disappeared herself. Travis has to try and re-assimilate himself back into every day life and reconnect with his young son before setting out to try and find his estranged wife. In many ways this film reminded me of director Wim Wenders 1976 film Kings of the Road. Both films take place mostly on the road in quiet, almost desolate places with two characters who barely know each other. This film is more about the family unit and loss but is equally as good. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes as well as numerous other prizes and it's fantastic. The story is tremendous. It was written by noted playwright/actor Sam Shepard and is a wonderful tale of isolation, loss and redemption. It unfolds at an incredibly slow pace by modern standards but is thoroughly gripping, divulging enough to keep you on tenterhooks but never telling you everything. I was completely gripped the whole way through. As well as a great plot the films other standout feature is its score which is performed on the slide guitar by Ry Cooper. It is haunting and repetitive but in a good way. It worked very well with the plot and the on screen visuals which were also exemplary. Frequent Wenders cinematographer Robby Muller creates some stunning sights of wide open, desolate vistas and intricate and interesting internal shots of bars, motels and houses. Some of the shots seem to last for minutes but that is part of what makes it so beautiful. The film is a joy to look at. On the acting side the film is once again terrific. Harry Dean Stanton is superb when playing the mute in early scenes but becomes more vocal as the film progresses. His performance overall was brilliant. His son, played by Hunter Carson was also excellent in his first film role, although he looked unnervingly like a young Jodie Foster. Supporting actors Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clement and especially Nastassja Kinski were also without fault. This is a film which might not appeal to everyone due to its slow nature but I loved it. I was mesmerised by the long, single camera shots in which the dialogue just went on and on and the cinematography was breathtaking. This isn't far off a perfect film and one that I'd recommend to anyone as long as their favourite film wasn't Transformers 2. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    the film starts slowly, keeping pace with Travis, who is wandering the desert aimlessly on foot. Travis has been a lost drifter for 4 years in the Mojave Desert and now appears to be mute, probably from suffering severe mental trauma, until his brother eventually found him and convinced him to go back home in LA. upon his arrival, Travis is gonna try to get his life together, reconnect with his son and brother and maybe right some wrongs from the past. Travis seems to come out of nowhere, and heading nowhere and at the end of the film, he disappears into the night, to an unknown destination.. since the beginning, there's a sentiment of coming back to the origins of cinema; i've read a review on the film that pointed out how Travis's journey responds to the evolution of American cinema (German director Wim Wenders's fascination for American cinema is obvious, as the very title of the film refers metaphorically to the Europe-USA rapport), and i can see how that's true seeing as Travis and the film go gradually from silence to speech, from open vast landscapes to more enclosed spaces defined by doors and walls, from desert to peep-show booths. Paris-Texas provides the possibility to see raw reality, uncategorized. Travis does not see the world as a coherent system that he's implicated to, but rather as a succession of moments and he's the spectator, which implies loneliness and alienation. the viewer follows with sincere emotion the journey of a father and a husband, lost in his past and searching for identity. the film is drenched in highly engaging, bittersweet atmosphere, arranged remarkably by the cinematography and the beautiful slide guitar score setting the mood. inducing touching scenes of characters communicating on an honest level, and one truly great scene in Travis's and Jane's conversation, the film represents the perfect balance between a good script, images of such beauty that they become paintings, actors that give life to their characters and music that goes so well that it becomes the shadow of the images. one of the most moving films i've seen.

    I regret watching this movie. The characters and performances are shallow and irritating. The cinematography is nice, but the direction is bland, substance-less and devoid of style. I understand that a lot of people who feel inclined to review Paris, Texas are so inclined because they really like the movie. ... but having just watched it, partially based on seeing so many gushing reviews here, I really feel that a contrary review is in order. My friend and I both just watched it and both regret it. Here are some of our mutual favorites, for reference, so you know who we are: In A Lonely Place, Chinatown, Brazil, Taxi Driver, Maltese Falcon, Blue Velvet, Stroszek, Persona... We both agree that Paris, Texas is THE most regrettable viewing experience we have shared. For additional reference of what this ranking means to us I will list other things we've watched besides our favorites, all of which we regret less (if at all) than Paris, Texas: The Quatermass Trilogy, Dune, High Sierra, Aquaboy cartoons, Melancholia, Plan 9 from Outer Space, the Sinister Urge, Gates of Heaven... I would say that if you happen to be one of the folks who will end up liking this movie, then you would have a good feeling after watching the first bit of it. But if you start watching it and feel irritable after only 15 minutes, you should stop watching it because that's the movie. That is what I wish I had heard from a trusted source several hours ago.

    Great. My first review. It's too bad I start with Paris, Texas because I have only one word for it: BORING. I watched a few hours earlier Coen's The Man Who Wasn't There. So, with a very good state of mind, I got to watch Paris, Texas, mostly because of the good reviews. The beginning was good: nice frames, clean and wide views in the country and a mysterious man with no past. I thought that should be watchable. I was mistaken. After an hour I had to go to sleep. I thought I was tired, but it was the movie. I didn't like Travis at all. No intellect. I see people like him everyday and they're no surprise. His kid is even smarter than him. If the intention was to see a simple man's life with his simple man's decisions then the film makers succeeded. But I think this recipe is for 5 year old's. Luckily there is a Forward button and I watched the predictable ending. 5 is merely for cinematography and a few good melodramatic scenes.

    Throughout the entirety of Paris, Texas's two-and-a-half-hour running time (and not one minute of it wasted), it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears, he's animalistic, not talking, motivated only by his strange, unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires, but there's always that wild, uncertain edge to his performance, so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character, as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle -- the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon, the story of his own conception, the falsity of a peep show, the million artificial lights of Los Angeles, and the obsession that gives the film its name, the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries, but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions, and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again, seeing his son end ex-wife embrace from a distance. Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering. All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are, for the most part, films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris, Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly.

    The depictions of America that most fascinate me have been carried out by Europeans. What stories we find in these ventures never really probe deep into actual life, which is often a facsimile concocted from outside knowledge, but they are a suitable excuse for the journey that transports out of the safe, familiar reaches. It's probably best if we don't use for example Zabriskie Point as a faithful blueprint for its turbulent era, but once it sets out for the desert? For Leone it was about the world (mirrored in the rugged faces) as the blank slate upon which a tapestry of fictions are enacted; myths presaging the passing of that world. With Melville  in Magnet of Doom - it was the road trip through the Deep South where we get to know little but see a lot. Herzog in Stroszek, where chickens confound us. Polanski made the most American film of all, working from a script by Robert Towne, but his Chinatown extends a little beyond the familiar reaches of neo-noir into the untravelled; dusty orange groves and acquifers late at night. Each in their peculiar way reveal a little of the fabric of the larger world. And it's always tied up to the landscape, always the landscape that draws us in, big and small. The endless stretch of asphalt through sunbaked desert, the motel's neon sign flashing against purpleorange horizons. A gas station in the middle of nowhere. I understand that these are the familiar sights of everyday commute for a sizeable portion of Americans, or a short drive away from home, but for us on the other side they are the source of endless allure - aptly, a world most of us Europeans have known through movies. It's not about the gas station then, but about the 'middle of nowhere'  a valuable space of contemplation missing from the Old Europe dissicated under so much time and history. Having sampled the familiar moviescapes of Los Angeles or Texas, these films often take to the desert, a further retreat towards the hermitage where a clear vision is possible. Wenders's film is true to all these things. He begins from the desert and emerges back into the known world, meaning whatever communion with the vastness took place is already behind us. Tellingly, the rugged protagonist emerges mute. The very title is about two worlds (of which there are many in the film), and the attempt to bridge the endless inbetween. The 'slice of life' is about familiar contrivance, like out of daytime soap. But something tells me the film didn't sweep the French at Cannes for its moral dilemmas, the French who so valued the escape into the dream world of noir and western 50 years ago. The moviescapes, again as perceived from the other side; rural America bathed in luminous phantasmagoria, a gas station filmed in bright reds and lime greens.

Dean takes Travis back to his L.A. home where he and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been looking after Travis' seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson) since Travis' wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) left him with them and disappeared herself. Travis has to try and re-assimilate himself back into every day life and reconnect with his young son before setting out to try and find his estranged wife. In many ways this film reminded me of director Wim Wenders 1976 film Kings of the Road. Both films take place mostly on the road in quiet, almost desolate places with two characters who barely know each other. This film is more about the family unit and loss but is equally as good. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes as well as numerous other prizes and it's fantastic. The story is tremendous. It was written by noted playwright/actor Sam Shepard and is a wonderful tale of isolation, loss and redemption. It unfolds at an incredibly slow pace by modern standards but is thoroughly gripping, divulging enough to keep you on tenterhooks but never telling you everything. I was completely gripped the whole way through. As well as a great plot the films other standout feature is its score which is performed on the slide guitar by Ry Cooper. It is haunting and repetitive but in a good way. It worked very well with the plot and the on screen visuals which were also exemplary. Frequent Wenders cinematographer Robby Muller creates some stunning sights of wide open, desolate vistas and intricate and interesting internal shots of bars, motels and houses. Some of the shots seem to last for minutes but that is part of what makes it so beautiful. The film is a joy to look at. On the acting side the film is once again terrific. Harry Dean Stanton is superb when playing the mute in early scenes but becomes more vocal as the film progresses. His performance overall was brilliant. His son, played by Hunter Carson was also excellent in his first film role, although he looked unnervingly like a young Jodie Foster. Supporting actors Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clement and especially Nastassja Kinski were also without fault. This is a film which might not appeal to everyone due to its slow nature but I loved it. I was mesmerised by the long, single camera shots in which the dialogue just went on and on and the cinematography was breathtaking. This isn't far off a perfect film and one that I'd recommend to anyone as long as their favourite film wasn't Transformers 2. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    the film starts slowly, keeping pace with Travis, who is wandering the desert aimlessly on foot. Travis has been a lost drifter for 4 years in the Mojave Desert and now appears to be mute, probably from suffering severe mental trauma, until his brother eventually found him and convinced him to go back home in LA. upon his arrival, Travis is gonna try to get his life together, reconnect with his son and brother and maybe right some wrongs from the past. Travis seems to come out of nowhere, and heading nowhere and at the end of the film, he disappears into the night, to an unknown destination.. since the beginning, there's a sentiment of coming back to the origins of cinema; i've read a review on the film that pointed out how Travis's journey responds to the evolution of American cinema (German director Wim Wenders's fascination for American cinema is obvious, as the very title of the film refers metaphorically to the Europe-USA rapport), and i can see how that's true seeing as Travis and the film go gradually from silence to speech, from open vast landscapes to more enclosed spaces defined by doors and walls, from desert to peep-show booths. Paris-Texas provides the possibility to see raw reality, uncategorized. Travis does not see the world as a coherent system that he's implicated to, but rather as a succession of moments and he's the spectator, which implies loneliness and alienation. the viewer follows with sincere emotion the journey of a father and a husband, lost in his past and searching for identity. the film is drenched in highly engaging, bittersweet atmosphere, arranged remarkably by the cinematography and the beautiful slide guitar score setting the mood. inducing touching scenes of characters communicating on an honest level, and one truly great scene in Travis's and Jane's conversation, the film represents the perfect balance between a good script, images of such beauty that they become paintings, actors that give life to their characters and music that goes so well that it becomes the shadow of the images. one of the most moving films i've seen.

    I regret watching this movie. The characters and performances are shallow and irritating. The cinematography is nice, but the direction is bland, substance-less and devoid of style. I understand that a lot of people who feel inclined to review Paris, Texas are so inclined because they really like the movie. ... but having just watched it, partially based on seeing so many gushing reviews here, I really feel that a contrary review is in order. My friend and I both just watched it and both regret it. Here are some of our mutual favorites, for reference, so you know who we are: In A Lonely Place, Chinatown, Brazil, Taxi Driver, Maltese Falcon, Blue Velvet, Stroszek, Persona... We both agree that Paris, Texas is THE most regrettable viewing experience we have shared. For additional reference of what this ranking means to us I will list other things we've watched besides our favorites, all of which we regret less (if at all) than Paris, Texas: The Quatermass Trilogy, Dune, High Sierra, Aquaboy cartoons, Melancholia, Plan 9 from Outer Space, the Sinister Urge, Gates of Heaven... I would say that if you happen to be one of the folks who will end up liking this movie, then you would have a good feeling after watching the first bit of it. But if you start watching it and feel irritable after only 15 minutes, you should stop watching it because that's the movie. That is what I wish I had heard from a trusted source several hours ago.

    Great. My first review. It's too bad I start with Paris, Texas because I have only one word for it: BORING. I watched a few hours earlier Coen's The Man Who Wasn't There. So, with a very good state of mind, I got to watch Paris, Texas, mostly because of the good reviews. The beginning was good: nice frames, clean and wide views in the country and a mysterious man with no past. I thought that should be watchable. I was mistaken. After an hour I had to go to sleep. I thought I was tired, but it was the movie. I didn't like Travis at all. No intellect. I see people like him everyday and they're no surprise. His kid is even smarter than him. If the intention was to see a simple man's life with his simple man's decisions then the film makers succeeded. But I think this recipe is for 5 year old's. Luckily there is a Forward button and I watched the predictable ending. 5 is merely for cinematography and a few good melodramatic scenes.

    Throughout the entirety of Paris, Texas's two-and-a-half-hour running time (and not one minute of it wasted), it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears, he's animalistic, not talking, motivated only by his strange, unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires, but there's always that wild, uncertain edge to his performance, so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character, as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle -- the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon, the story of his own conception, the falsity of a peep show, the million artificial lights of Los Angeles, and the obsession that gives the film its name, the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries, but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions, and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again, seeing his son end ex-wife embrace from a distance. Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering. All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are, for the most part, films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris, Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly.

    The depictions of America that most fascinate me have been carried out by Europeans. What stories we find in these ventures never really probe deep into actual life, which is often a facsimile concocted from outside knowledge, but they are a suitable excuse for the journey that transports out of the safe, familiar reaches. It's probably best if we don't use for example Zabriskie Point as a faithful blueprint for its turbulent era, but once it sets out for the desert? For Leone it was about the world (mirrored in the rugged faces) as the blank slate upon which a tapestry of fictions are enacted; myths presaging the passing of that world. With Melville  in Magnet of Doom - it was the road trip through the Deep South where we get to know little but see a lot. Herzog in Stroszek, where chickens confound us. Polanski made the most American film of all, working from a script by Robert Towne, but his Chinatown extends a little beyond the familiar reaches of neo-noir into the untravelled; dusty orange groves and acquifers late at night. Each in their peculiar way reveal a little of the fabric of the larger world. And it's always tied up to the landscape, always the landscape that draws us in, big and small. The endless stretch of asphalt through sunbaked desert, the motel's neon sign flashing against purpleorange horizons. A gas station in the middle of nowhere. I understand that these are the familiar sights of everyday commute for a sizeable portion of Americans, or a short drive away from home, but for us on the other side they are the source of endless allure - aptly, a world most of us Europeans have known through movies. It's not about the gas station then, but about the 'middle of nowhere'  a valuable space of contemplation missing from the Old Europe dissicated under so much time and history. Having sampled the familiar moviescapes of Los Angeles or Texas, these films often take to the desert, a further retreat towards the hermitage where a clear vision is possible. Wenders's film is true to all these things. He begins from the desert and emerges back into the known world, meaning whatever communion with the vastness took place is already behind us. Tellingly, the rugged protagonist emerges mute. The very title is about two worlds (of which there are many in the film), and the attempt to bridge the endless inbetween. The 'slice of life' is about familiar contrivance, like out of daytime soap. But something tells me the film didn't sweep the French at Cannes for its moral dilemmas, the French who so valued the escape into the dream world of noir and western 50 years ago. The moviescapes, again as perceived from the other side; rural America bathed in luminous phantasmagoria, a gas station filmed in bright reds and lime greens. Or a suburban landscape so amazingly bland, as it unfolds from behind the windshield of a moving car. That amazing cat house, itself a mysterious house of fictions where two worlds are brought together in disguise. It could have been quite something if Wenders understood how a frame functions. He knows how to set them up, but not quite what they do. Inside the cat house, for example, the corridor lined-up with curtains each granting passage  one of the most inspired codas of cinematic self-reference. Wenders instead gives us long monologues, he explains too much that we don't need to know. I understand that he values emotional consonance - where I differ, is that I'm drawn towards films that operate or dismantle at the level of perception rather than feeling. It's good though, as artifice breathing life into cinematic space. As a piece of abstract soul, seen through the road darkly.

    'Paris, Texas', mind you, is not edge-of-the-seat viewing. It is not thrill-a-minute cinema; neither will your adrenaline be activated every 5 or 10 minutes. It is a slow, introspective study, through the interplay of just 5 characters, of solitude, and loneliness, and its gradual fading away ... of the ingratiation of the archetypal 'outsider' into the fold of mankind, once again ... even if, at the end, the wheel turns full circle ... Harry Dean Stanton, even if he underplays his role to textbook perfection, straddles the film like a colossus from start to finish. A complex character if there ever was one, it is Stanton's triumph that he imbues it with shades which make it more comprehensible and less dense ... and the mercurial Natassja Kinski, who gets barely half an hour of screen time, lights it up as only she can. The penultimate scene between the two (I won't reveal the details here) provides one of the most intense picturizations of the husband-wife relationship that I, at least, have seen. So far as performances go, it would be unfair not to put in a word for the adorable Hunter Henderson, who plays the couple's son Hunter, and illumines every scene he is in. And yet, perhaps, 'Paris, Texas' would not have been what it is without Ry Cooder's haunting background score ... perhaps the greatest example of the use of the guitar in the background music of any film, to devastating effect. Not popcorn viewing for sure, but if you're in the mood for serious, affecting cinema, don't miss 'Paris, Texas'.

    Wim Wenders's Paris,Texas is a film that is narrated through road trips. An utterly lost man (in every sense of the word) is tracked down by his brother and reunited with his son. On discovering a part of his old self, the man takes on a journey to bring his son back with his estranged mother. What the viewer doesn't know till the very end of the movie is as to why this family had been separated in the first place. The film's pace is quite in contrast to that of the fast and frequent road trips on screen. Although the slowness and did get to my head at times, I found the film quite riveting on the whole. The barren roads of Texas contrasted against the busy highways of Houston is an interesting feature of this film. At heart, "Paris, Texas" is an intense film about human separation and more importantly, reunion.

    Wenders, M&uuml;ller, Shepard, Cooder, Stanton, Stockwell. Could there be a better combination  and concentration!  of talent? Film is indeed poetry, and this is one of the most beautiful poems of parenthood I've seen. Not explicit, preachy, but otherworldly, subtle, comic, bittersweet. The alienation from one's own self, all of this internal, has its visual counterpoint first in the concept of walkabout in the open space, the desert, the quiet; then in the urbanity of modern life, the closed space, the airplane, the noise. Change, both internal and external (appearance such as the rugged beard, mutism), reflected in the road movie. His self-discovery is actually our discovery, not only of him but of the movie. Travis has two beginnings: as explained by him, he was most likely conceived in Paris, Texas. It was his first beginning, the film his second. Stanton is sublime. His ability to convey meaning and emotion through the slightest gestures and expressions is unprecedented. And yet, at the same time, his ability to conceal meaning and emotion is just as evocatively effective  his face is a blank, his eyes devoid of anything one might connect to, finding meaning from. That lunch they're having together before hitting the road, father and son, somehow reifies the film's many narratives for me. There we have the walkabout/journey/highway and family/loss/past at an intersection. And it's a perfectly beautiful moment.

    First of all i just want to say WOW,what a great movie. I,ve seen a lot of them and this one just blew my mind completely. The beginning is a marvelous opening with Ry Cooder's wonderful blues guitar (it is one of the best soundtrack's iv'e ever heard). And who's that? Well if it isn't the presence of Harry Dean Stanton in his best role to this day(the performance is really captivating),as he wanders to the path of nothing in the lonely desert. He soon makes his way in to a bar and passes out,and thats when the movie "begins" if you know what i mean. The man we just saw has no name,no past,nothing. Soon the doctor that takes him in finds a number which is his brother(Dean Stockwell). The brother rushes down to the deserts of Texas and finds a hurting and scarred man with no life in him. One of the many brilliant things about this movie is that Stanton doesn't say a word until 20 minutes in to this film,and you get to do some real character study of him in this time. We soon find out Stanton has a son and that his brother has taken care of him for the years Stanton's been gone. When they arrive to LA,many things happen very quickly for Stanton. He meets the son that doesn't remember him(Hunter Carson),Stockwells wife(Aurore Clement in one of her best roles,i haven't seen her in much,and she deserves more,because she is a very good actor) and later,when they see film clips,we find out that Stanton also has a long lost wife in which he remembers. But Carson and Stanton really hit it off as father and son in a memorable 3 minutes where Stanton jokes around with the Son. Stanton is determined to find the wife but only hear rumors of where she is which is that she is working in Houston.Pretty shockingly,Stanton and Carson make there way to Houston without telling Stockwell or Clement. The finest scene of ALL,is when Stanton finds The wife(Nastassja Kinski in such a gripping and flawless performance that makes this movie a masterpiece). There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computer,and the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie. Everything about it is great,the cinematography,the acting,the soundtrack,the melancholic "thing" about it.It is really worth it.

    Four years after going missing Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out of the vast South Texas desert. After collapsing in a saloon a doctor treats him and discovers his brother's business card in his wallet. Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) flies to Texas to meet his brother and has many questions for him. Travis appears to be mute however and doesn't eat, sleep or talk for days. When he finally opens his mouth it is revealed that he remembers little about the last four years. Dean takes Travis back to his L.A. home where he and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been looking after Travis' seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson) since Travis' wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) left him with them and disappeared herself. Travis has to try and re-assimilate himself back into every day life and reconnect with his young son before setting out to try and find his estranged wife.

    The depictions of America that most fascinate me have been carried out by Europeans. What stories we find in these ventures never really probe deep into actual life, which is often a facsimile concocted from outside knowledge, but they are a suitable excuse for the journey that transports out of the safe, familiar reaches. It's probably best if we don't use for example Zabriskie Point as a faithful blueprint for its turbulent era, but once it sets out for the desert? For Leone it was about the world (mirrored in the rugged faces) as the blank slate upon which a tapestry of fictions are enacted; myths presaging the passing of that world. With Melville  in Magnet of Doom - it was the road trip through the Deep South where we get to know little but see a lot. Herzog in Stroszek, where chickens confound us. Polanski made the most American film of all, working from a script by Robert Towne, but his Chinatown extends a little beyond the familiar reaches of neo-noir into the untravelled; dusty orange groves and acquifers late at night. Each in their peculiar way reveal a little of the fabric of the larger world. And it's always tied up to the landscape, always the landscape that draws us in, big and small. The endless stretch of asphalt through sunbaked desert, the motel's neon sign flashing against purpleorange horizons. A gas station in the middle of nowhere. I understand that these are the familiar sights of everyday commute for a sizeable portion of Americans, or a short drive away from home, but for us on the other side they are the source of endless allure - aptly, a world most of us Europeans have known through movies. It's not about the gas station then, but about the 'middle of nowhere'  a valuable space of contemplation missing from the Old Europe dissicated under so much time and history. Having sampled the familiar moviescapes of Los Angeles or Texas, these films often take to the desert, a further retreat towards the hermitage where a clear vision is possible. Wenders's film is true to all these things. He begins from the desert and emerges back into the known world, meaning whatever communion with the vastness took place is already behind us. Tellingly, the rugged protagonist emerges mute. The very title is about two worlds (of which there are many in the film), and the attempt to bridge the endless inbetween. The 'slice of life' is about familiar contrivance, like out of daytime soap. But something tells me the film didn't sweep the French at Cannes for its moral dilemmas, the French who so valued the escape into the dream world of noir and western 50 years ago. The moviescapes, again as perceived from the other side; rural America bathed in luminous phantasmagoria, a gas station filmed in bright reds and lime greens. Or a suburban landscape so amazingly bland, as it unfolds from behind the windshield of a moving car. That amazing cat house, itself a mysterious house of fictions where two worlds are brought together in disguise. It could have been quite something if Wenders understood how a frame functions. He knows how to set them up, but not quite what they do. Inside the cat house, for example, the corridor lined-up with curtains each granting passage  one of the most inspired codas of cinematic self-reference. Wenders instead gives us long monologues, he explains too much that we don't need to know. I understand that he values emotional consonance - where I differ, is that I'm drawn towards films that operate or dismantle at the level of perception rather than feeling. It's good though, as artifice breathing life into cinematic space. As a piece of abstract soul, seen through the road darkly.

    'Paris, Texas', mind you, is not edge-of-the-seat viewing. It is not thrill-a-minute cinema; neither will your adrenaline be activated every 5 or 10 minutes. It is a slow, introspective study, through the interplay of just 5 characters, of solitude, and loneliness, and its gradual fading away ... of the ingratiation of the archetypal 'outsider' into the fold of mankind, once again ... even if, at the end, the wheel turns full circle ... Harry Dean Stanton, even if he underplays his role to textbook perfection, straddles the film like a colossus from start to finish. A complex character if there ever was one, it is Stanton's triumph that he imbues it with shades which make it more comprehensible and less dense ... and the mercurial Natassja Kinski, who gets barely half an hour of screen time, lights it up as only she can. The penultimate scene between the two (I won't reveal the details here) provides one of the most intense picturizations of the husband-wife relationship that I, at least, have seen. So far as performances go, it would be unfair not to put in a word for the adorable Hunter Henderson, who plays the couple's son Hunter, and illumines every scene he is in. And yet, perhaps, 'Paris, Texas' would not have been what it is without Ry Cooder's haunting background score ... perhaps the greatest example of the use of the guitar in the background music of any film, to devastating effect. Not popcorn viewing for sure, but if you're in the mood for serious, affecting cinema, don't miss 'Paris, Texas'.

    Wim Wenders's Paris,Texas is a film that is narrated through road trips. An utterly lost man (in every sense of the word) is tracked down by his brother and reunited with his son. On discovering a part of his old self, the man takes on a journey to bring his son back with his estranged mother. What the viewer doesn't know till the very end of the movie is as to why this family had been separated in the first place. The film's pace is quite in contrast to that of the fast and frequent road trips on screen. Although the slowness and did get to my head at times, I found the film quite riveting on the whole. The barren roads of Texas contrasted against the busy highways of Houston is an interesting feature of this film. At heart, "Paris, Texas" is an intense film about human separation and more importantly, reunion.

    Wenders, M&uuml;ller, Shepard, Cooder, Stanton, Stockwell. Could there be a better combination  and concentration!  of talent? Film is indeed poetry, and this is one of the most beautiful poems of parenthood I've seen. Not explicit, preachy, but otherworldly, subtle, comic, bittersweet. The alienation from one's own self, all of this internal, has its visual counterpoint first in the concept of walkabout in the open space, the desert, the quiet; then in the urbanity of modern life, the closed space, the airplane, the noise. Change, both internal and external (appearance such as the rugged beard, mutism), reflected in the road movie. His self-discovery is actually our discovery, not only of him but of the movie. Travis has two beginnings: as explained by him, he was most likely conceived in Paris, Texas. It was his first beginning, the film his second. Stanton is sublime. His ability to convey meaning and emotion through the slightest gestures and expressions is unprecedented. And yet, at the same time, his ability to conceal meaning and emotion is just as evocatively effective  his face is a blank, his eyes devoid of anything one might connect to, finding meaning from. That lunch they're having together before hitting the road, father and son, somehow reifies the film's many narratives for me. There we have the walkabout/journey/highway and family/loss/past at an intersection. And it's a perfectly beautiful moment.

    First of all i just want to say WOW,what a great movie. I,ve seen a lot of them and this one just blew my mind completely. The beginning is a marvelous opening with Ry Cooder's wonderful blues guitar (it is one of the best soundtrack's iv'e ever heard). And who's that? Well if it isn't the presence of Harry Dean Stanton in his best role to this day(the performance is really captivating),as he wanders to the path of nothing in the lonely desert. He soon makes his way in to a bar and passes out,and thats when the movie "begins" if you know what i mean. The man we just saw has no name,no past,nothing. Soon the doctor that takes him in finds a number which is his brother(Dean Stockwell). The brother rushes down to the deserts of Texas and finds a hurting and scarred man with no life in him. One of the many brilliant things about this movie is that Stanton doesn't say a word until 20 minutes in to this film,and you get to do some real character study of him in this time. We soon find out Stanton has a son and that his brother has taken care of him for the years Stanton's been gone. When they arrive to LA,many things happen very quickly for Stanton. He meets the son that doesn't remember him(Hunter Carson),Stockwells wife(Aurore Clement in one of her best roles,i haven't seen her in much,and she deserves more,because she is a very good actor) and later,when they see film clips,we find out that Stanton also has a long lost wife in which he remembers. But Carson and Stanton really hit it off as father and son in a memorable 3 minutes where Stanton jokes around with the Son. Stanton is determined to find the wife but only hear rumors of where she is which is that she is working in Houston.Pretty shockingly,Stanton and Carson make there way to Houston without telling Stockwell or Clement. The finest scene of ALL,is when Stanton finds The wife(Nastassja Kinski in such a gripping and flawless performance that makes this movie a masterpiece). There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computer,and the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie. Everything about it is great,the cinematography,the acting,the soundtrack,the melancholic "thing" about it.It is really worth it.

    Four years after going missing Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out of the vast South Texas desert. After collapsing in a saloon a doctor treats him and discovers his brother's business card in his wallet. Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) flies to Texas to meet his brother and has many questions for him. Travis appears to be mute however and doesn't eat, sleep or talk for days. When he finally opens his mouth it is revealed that he remembers little about the last four years. Dean takes Travis back to his L.A. home where he and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been looking after Travis' seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson) since Travis' wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) left him with them and disappeared herself. Travis has to try and re-assimilate himself back into every day life and reconnect with his young son before setting out to try and find his estranged wife. In many ways this film reminded me of director Wim Wenders 1976 film Kings of the Road. Both films take place mostly on the road in quiet, almost desolate places with two characters who barely know each other. This film is more about the family unit and loss but is equally as good. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes as well as numerous other prizes and it's fantastic. The story is tremendous. It was written by noted playwright/actor Sam Shepard and is a wonderful tale of isolation, loss and redemption. It unfolds at an incredibly slow pace by modern standards but is thoroughly gripping, divulging enough to keep you on tenterhooks but never telling you everything. I was completely gripped the whole way through. As well as a great plot the films other standout feature is its score which is performed on the slide guitar by Ry Cooper. It is haunting and repetitive but in a good way. It worked very well with the plot and the on screen visuals which were also exemplary. Frequent Wenders cinematographer Robby Muller creates some stunning sights of wide open, desolate vistas and intricate and interesting internal shots of bars, motels and houses. Some of the shots seem to last for minutes but that is part of what makes it so beautiful. The film is a joy to look at. On the acting side the film is once again terrific. Harry Dean Stanton is superb when playing the mute in early scenes but becomes more vocal as the film progresses. His performance overall was brilliant. His son, played by Hunter Carson was also excellent in his first film role, although he looked unnervingly like a young Jodie Foster. Supporting actors Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clement and especially Nastassja Kinski were also without fault. This is a film which might not appeal to everyone due to its slow nature but I loved it. I was mesmerised by the long, single camera shots in which the dialogue just went on and on and the cinematography was breathtaking. This isn't far off a perfect film and one that I'd recommend to anyone as long as their favourite film wasn't Transformers 2. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    the film starts slowly, keeping pace with Travis, who is wandering the desert aimlessly on foot. Travis has been a lost drifter for 4 years in the Mojave Desert and now appears to be mute, probably from suffering severe mental trauma, until his brother eventually found him and convinced him to go back home in LA. upon his arrival, Travis is gonna try to get his life together, reconnect with his son and brother and maybe right some wrongs from the past. Travis seems to come out of nowhere, and heading nowhere and at the end of the film, he disappears into the night, to an unknown destination.. since the beginning, there's a sentiment of coming back to the origins of cinema; i've read a review on the film that pointed out how Travis's journey responds to the evolution of American cinema (German director Wim Wenders's fascination for American cinema is obvious, as the very title of the film refers metaphorically to the Europe-USA rapport), and i can see how that's true seeing as Travis and the film go gradually from silence to speech, from open vast landscapes to more enclosed spaces defined by doors and walls, from desert to peep-show booths. Paris-Texas provides the possibility to see raw reality, uncategorized. Travis does not see the world as a coherent system that he's implicated to, but rather as a succession of moments and he's the spectator, which implies loneliness and alienation. the viewer follows with sincere emotion the journey of a father and a husband, lost in his past and searching for identity. the film is drenched in highly engaging, bittersweet atmosphere, arranged remarkably by the cinematography and the beautiful slide guitar score setting the mood. inducing touching scenes of characters communicating on an honest level, and one truly great scene in Travis's and Jane's conversation, the film represents the perfect balance between a good script, images of such beauty that they become paintings, actors that give life to their characters and music that goes so well that it becomes the shadow of the images. one of the most moving films i've seen.

    I regret watching this movie. The characters and performances are shallow and irritating. The cinematography is nice, but the direction is bland, substance-less and devoid of style. I understand that a lot of people who feel inclined to review Paris, Texas are so inclined because they really like the movie. ... but having just watched it, partially based on seeing so many gushing reviews here, I really feel that a contrary review is in order. My friend and I both just watched it and both regret it. Here are some of our mutual favorites, for reference, so you know who we are: In A Lonely Place, Chinatown, Brazil, Taxi Driver, Maltese Falcon, Blue Velvet, Stroszek, Persona... We both agree that Paris, Texas is THE most regrettable viewing experience we have shared. For additional reference of what this ranking means to us I will list other things we've watched besides our favorites, all of which we regret less (if at all) than Paris, Texas: The Quatermass Trilogy, Dune, High Sierra, Aquaboy cartoons, Melancholia, Plan 9 from Outer Space, the Sinister Urge, Gates of Heaven... I would say that if you happen to be one of the folks who will end up liking this movie, then you would have a good feeling after watching the first bit of it. But if you start watching it and feel irritable after only 15 minutes, you should stop watching it because that's the movie. That is what I wish I had heard from a trusted source several hours ago.

    Great. My first review. It's too bad I start with Paris, Texas because I have only one word for it: BORING. I watched a few hours earlier Coen's The Man Who Wasn't There. So, with a very good state of mind, I got to watch Paris, Texas, mostly because of the good reviews. The beginning was good: nice frames, clean and wide views in the country and a mysterious man with no past. I thought that should be watchable. I was mistaken. After an hour I had to go to sleep. I thought I was tired, but it was the movie. I didn't like Travis at all. No intellect. I see people like him everyday and they're no surprise. His kid is even smarter than him. If the intention was to see a simple man's life with his simple man's decisions then the film makers succeeded. But I think this recipe is for 5 year old's. Luckily there is a Forward button and I watched the predictable ending. 5 is merely for cinematography and a few good melodramatic scenes.

    Throughout the entirety of Paris, Texas's two-and-a-half-hour running time (and not one minute of it wasted), it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears, he's animalistic, not talking, motivated only by his strange, unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires, but there's always that wild, uncertain edge to his performance, so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character, as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle -- the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon, the story of his own conception, the falsity of a peep show, the million artificial lights of Los Angeles, and the obsession that gives the film its name, the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries, but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions, and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again, seeing his son end ex-wife embrace from a distance. Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering. All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are, for the most part, films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris, Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly.

There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computer,and the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie. Everything about it is great,the cinematography,the acting,the soundtrack,the melancholic "thing" about it.It is really worth it.

    Four years after going missing Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out of the vast South Texas desert. After collapsing in a saloon a doctor treats him and discovers his brother's business card in his wallet. Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) flies to Texas to meet his brother and has many questions for him. Travis appears to be mute however and doesn't eat, sleep or talk for days. When he finally opens his mouth it is revealed that he remembers little about the last four years. Dean takes Travis back to his L.A. home where he and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been looking after Travis' seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson) since Travis' wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) left him with them and disappeared herself. Travis has to try and re-assimilate himself back into every day life and reconnect with his young son before setting out to try and find his estranged wife. In many ways this film reminded me of director Wim Wenders 1976 film Kings of the Road. Both films take place mostly on the road in quiet, almost desolate places with two characters who barely know each other. This film is more about the family unit and loss but is equally as good. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes as well as numerous other prizes and it's fantastic. The story is tremendous. It was written by noted playwright/actor Sam Shepard and is a wonderful tale of isolation, loss and redemption. It unfolds at an incredibly slow pace by modern standards but is thoroughly gripping, divulging enough to keep you on tenterhooks but never telling you everything. I was completely gripped the whole way through. As well as a great plot the films other standout feature is its score which is performed on the slide guitar by Ry Cooper. It is haunting and repetitive but in a good way. It worked very well with the plot and the on screen visuals which were also exemplary. Frequent Wenders cinematographer Robby Muller creates some stunning sights of wide open, desolate vistas and intricate and interesting internal shots of bars, motels and houses. Some of the shots seem to last for minutes but that is part of what makes it so beautiful. The film is a joy to look at. On the acting side the film is once again terrific. Harry Dean Stanton is superb when playing the mute in early scenes but becomes more vocal as the film progresses. His performance overall was brilliant. His son, played by Hunter Carson was also excellent in his first film role, although he looked unnervingly like a young Jodie Foster. Supporting actors Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clement and especially Nastassja Kinski were also without fault. This is a film which might not appeal to everyone due to its slow nature but I loved it. I was mesmerised by the long, single camera shots in which the dialogue just went on and on and the cinematography was breathtaking. This isn't far off a perfect film and one that I'd recommend to anyone as long as their favourite film wasn't Transformers 2. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    the film starts slowly, keeping pace with Travis, who is wandering the desert aimlessly on foot. Travis has been a lost drifter for 4 years in the Mojave Desert and now appears to be mute, probably from suffering severe mental trauma, until his brother eventually found him and convinced him to go back home in LA. upon his arrival, Travis is gonna try to get his life together, reconnect with his son and brother and maybe right some wrongs from the past. Travis seems to come out of nowhere, and heading nowhere and at the end of the film, he disappears into the night, to an unknown destination.. since the beginning, there's a sentiment of coming back to the origins of cinema; i've read a review on the film that pointed out how Travis's journey responds to the evolution of American cinema (German director Wim Wenders's fascination for American cinema is obvious, as the very title of the film refers metaphorically to the Europe-USA rapport), and i can see how that's true seeing as Travis and the film go gradually from silence to speech, from open vast landscapes to more enclosed spaces defined by doors and walls, from desert to peep-show booths. Paris-Texas provides the possibility to see raw reality, uncategorized. Travis does not see the world as a coherent system that he's implicated to, but rather as a succession of moments and he's the spectator, which implies loneliness and alienation. the viewer follows with sincere emotion the journey of a father and a husband, lost in his past and searching for identity. the film is drenched in highly engaging, bittersweet atmosphere, arranged remarkably by the cinematography and the beautiful slide guitar score setting the mood. inducing touching scenes of characters communicating on an honest level, and one truly great scene in Travis's and Jane's conversation, the film represents the perfect balance between a good script, images of such beauty that they become paintings, actors that give life to their characters and music that goes so well that it becomes the shadow of the images. one of the most moving films i've seen.

    I regret watching this movie. The characters and performances are shallow and irritating. The cinematography is nice, but the direction is bland, substance-less and devoid of style. I understand that a lot of people who feel inclined to review Paris, Texas are so inclined because they really like the movie. ... but having just watched it, partially based on seeing so many gushing reviews here, I really feel that a contrary review is in order. My friend and I both just watched it and both regret it. Here are some of our mutual favorites, for reference, so you know who we are: In A Lonely Place, Chinatown, Brazil, Taxi Driver, Maltese Falcon, Blue Velvet, Stroszek, Persona... We both agree that Paris, Texas is THE most regrettable viewing experience we have shared. For additional reference of what this ranking means to us I will list other things we've watched besides our favorites, all of which we regret less (if at all) than Paris, Texas: The Quatermass Trilogy, Dune, High Sierra, Aquaboy cartoons, Melancholia, Plan 9 from Outer Space, the Sinister Urge, Gates of Heaven... I would say that if you happen to be one of the folks who will end up liking this movie, then you would have a good feeling after watching the first bit of it. But if you start watching it and feel irritable after only 15 minutes, you should stop watching it because that's the movie. That is what I wish I had heard from a trusted source several hours ago.

    Great. My first review. It's too bad I start with Paris, Texas because I have only one word for it: BORING. I watched a few hours earlier Coen's The Man Who Wasn't There. So, with a very good state of mind, I got to watch Paris, Texas, mostly because of the good reviews. The beginning was good: nice frames, clean and wide views in the country and a mysterious man with no past. I thought that should be watchable. I was mistaken. After an hour I had to go to sleep. I thought I was tired, but it was the movie. I didn't like Travis at all. No intellect. I see people like him everyday and they're no surprise. His kid is even smarter than him. If the intention was to see a simple man's life with his simple man's decisions then the film makers succeeded. But I think this recipe is for 5 year old's. Luckily there is a Forward button and I watched the predictable ending. 5 is merely for cinematography and a few good melodramatic scenes.

    Throughout the entirety of Paris, Texas's two-and-a-half-hour running time (and not one minute of it wasted), it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears, he's animalistic, not talking, motivated only by his strange, unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires, but there's always that wild, uncertain edge to his performance, so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character, as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle -- the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon, the story of his own conception, the falsity of a peep show, the million artificial lights of Los Angeles, and the obsession that gives the film its name, the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries, but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions, and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again, seeing his son end ex-wife embrace from a distance. Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering. All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are, for the most part, films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris, Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly.

    The depictions of America that most fascinate me have been carried out by Europeans. What stories we find in these ventures never really probe deep into actual life, which is often a facsimile concocted from outside knowledge, but they are a suitable excuse for the journey that transports out of the safe, familiar reaches. It's probably best if we don't use for example Zabriskie Point as a faithful blueprint for its turbulent era, but once it sets out for the desert? For Leone it was about the world (mirrored in the rugged faces) as the blank slate upon which a tapestry of fictions are enacted; myths presaging the passing of that world. With Melville  in Magnet of Doom - it was the road trip through the Deep South where we get to know little but see a lot. Herzog in Stroszek, where chickens confound us. Polanski made the most American film of all, working from a script by Robert Towne, but his Chinatown extends a little beyond the familiar reaches of neo-noir into the untravelled; dusty orange groves and acquifers late at night. Each in their peculiar way reveal a little of the fabric of the larger world. And it's always tied up to the landscape, always the landscape that draws us in, big and small. The endless stretch of asphalt through sunbaked desert, the motel's neon sign flashing against purpleorange horizons. A gas station in the middle of nowhere. I understand that these are the familiar sights of everyday commute for a sizeable portion of Americans, or a short drive away from home, but for us on the other side they are the source of endless allure - aptly, a world most of us Europeans have known through movies. It's not about the gas station then, but about the 'middle of nowhere'  a valuable space of contemplation missing from the Old Europe dissicated under so much time and history. Having sampled the familiar moviescapes of Los Angeles or Texas, these films often take to the desert, a further retreat towards the hermitage where a clear vision is possible. Wenders's film is true to all these things. He begins from the desert and emerges back into the known world, meaning whatever communion with the vastness took place is already behind us. Tellingly, the rugged protagonist emerges mute. The very title is about two worlds (of which there are many in the film), and the attempt to bridge the endless inbetween. The 'slice of life' is about familiar contrivance, like out of daytime soap. But something tells me the film didn't sweep the French at Cannes for its moral dilemmas, the French who so valued the escape into the dream world of noir and western 50 years ago. The moviescapes, again as perceived from the other side; rural America bathed in luminous phantasmagoria, a gas station filmed in bright reds and lime greens. Or a suburban landscape so amazingly bland, as it unfolds from behind the windshield of a moving car. That amazing cat house, itself a mysterious house of fictions where two worlds are brought together in disguise. It could have been quite something if Wenders understood how a frame functions. He knows how to set them up, but not quite what they do. Inside the cat house, for example, the corridor lined-up with curtains each granting passage  one of the most inspired codas of cinematic self-reference. Wenders instead gives us long monologues, he explains too much that we don't need to know. I understand that he values emotional consonance - where I differ, is that I'm drawn towards films that operate or dismantle at the level of perception rather than feeling. It's good though, as artifice breathing life into cinematic space. As a piece of abstract soul, seen through the road darkly.

    'Paris, Texas', mind you, is not edge-of-the-seat viewing. It is not thrill-a-minute cinema; neither will your adrenaline be activated every 5 or 10 minutes. It is a slow, introspective study, through the interplay of just 5 characters, of solitude, and loneliness, and its gradual fading away ... of the ingratiation of the archetypal 'outsider' into the fold of mankind, once again ... even if, at the end, the wheel turns full circle ... Harry Dean Stanton, even if he underplays his role to textbook perfection, straddles the film like a colossus from start to finish. A complex character if there ever was one, it is Stanton's triumph that he imbues it with shades which make it more comprehensible and less dense ... and the mercurial Natassja Kinski, who gets barely half an hour of screen time, lights it up as only she can. The penultimate scene between the two (I won't reveal the details here) provides one of the most intense picturizations of the husband-wife relationship that I, at least, have seen. So far as performances go, it would be unfair not to put in a word for the adorable Hunter Henderson, who plays the couple's son Hunter, and illumines every scene he is in. And yet, perhaps, 'Paris, Texas' would not have been what it is without Ry Cooder's haunting background score ... perhaps the greatest example of the use of the guitar in the background music of any film, to devastating effect. Not popcorn viewing for sure, but if you're in the mood for serious, affecting cinema, don't miss 'Paris, Texas'.

    Wim Wenders's Paris,Texas is a film that is narrated through road trips. An utterly lost man (in every sense of the word) is tracked down by his brother and reunited with his son. On discovering a part of his old self, the man takes on a journey to bring his son back with his estranged mother. What the viewer doesn't know till the very end of the movie is as to why this family had been separated in the first place. The film's pace is quite in contrast to that of the fast and frequent road trips on screen. Although the slowness and did get to my head at times, I found the film quite riveting on the whole. The barren roads of Texas contrasted against the busy highways of Houston is an interesting feature of this film. At heart, "Paris, Texas" is an intense film about human separation and more importantly, reunion.

    Wenders, M&uuml;ller, Shepard, Cooder, Stanton, Stockwell. Could there be a better combination  and concentration!  of talent? Film is indeed poetry, and this is one of the most beautiful poems of parenthood I've seen. Not explicit, preachy, but otherworldly, subtle, comic, bittersweet. The alienation from one's own self, all of this internal, has its visual counterpoint first in the concept of walkabout in the open space, the desert, the quiet; then in the urbanity of modern life, the closed space, the airplane, the noise. Change, both internal and external (appearance such as the rugged beard, mutism), reflected in the road movie. His self-discovery is actually our discovery, not only of him but of the movie. Travis has two beginnings: as explained by him, he was most likely conceived in Paris, Texas. It was his first beginning, the film his second. Stanton is sublime. His ability to convey meaning and emotion through the slightest gestures and expressions is unprecedented. And yet, at the same time, his ability to conceal meaning and emotion is just as evocatively effective  his face is a blank, his eyes devoid of anything one might connect to, finding meaning from. That lunch they're having together before hitting the road, father and son, somehow reifies the film's many narratives for me. There we have the walkabout/journey/highway and family/loss/past at an intersection. And it's a perfectly beautiful moment.

    First of all i just want to say WOW,what a great movie. I,ve seen a lot of them and this one just blew my mind completely. The beginning is a marvelous opening with Ry Cooder's wonderful blues guitar (it is one of the best soundtrack's iv'e ever heard). And who's that? Well if it isn't the presence of Harry Dean Stanton in his best role to this day(the performance is really captivating),as he wanders to the path of nothing in the lonely desert. He soon makes his way in to a bar and passes out,and thats when the movie "begins" if you know what i mean. The man we just saw has no name,no past,nothing. Soon the doctor that takes him in finds a number which is his brother(Dean Stockwell). The brother rushes down to the deserts of Texas and finds a hurting and scarred man with no life in him. One of the many brilliant things about this movie is that Stanton doesn't say a word until 20 minutes in to this film,and you get to do some real character study of him in this time. We soon find out Stanton has a son and that his brother has taken care of him for the years Stanton's been gone. When they arrive to LA,many things happen very quickly for Stanton. He meets the son that doesn't remember him(Hunter Carson),Stockwells wife(Aurore Clement in one of her best roles,i haven't seen her in much,and she deserves more,because she is a very good actor) and later,when they see film clips,we find out that Stanton also has a long lost wife in which he remembers. But Carson and Stanton really hit it off as father and son in a memorable 3 minutes where Stanton jokes around with the Son. Stanton is determined to find the wife but only hear rumors of where she is which is that she is working in Houston.Pretty shockingly,Stanton and Carson make there way to Houston without telling Stockwell or Clement. The finest scene of ALL,is when Stanton finds The wife(Nastassja Kinski in such a gripping and flawless performance that makes this movie a masterpiece). There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computer,and the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie. Everything about it is great,the cinematography,the acting,the soundtrack,the melancholic "thing" about it.It is really worth it.

    Four years after going missing Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out of the vast South Texas desert.

Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering. All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are, for the most part, films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris, Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly.

    The depictions of America that most fascinate me have been carried out by Europeans. What stories we find in these ventures never really probe deep into actual life, which is often a facsimile concocted from outside knowledge, but they are a suitable excuse for the journey that transports out of the safe, familiar reaches. It's probably best if we don't use for example Zabriskie Point as a faithful blueprint for its turbulent era, but once it sets out for the desert? For Leone it was about the world (mirrored in the rugged faces) as the blank slate upon which a tapestry of fictions are enacted; myths presaging the passing of that world. With Melville  in Magnet of Doom - it was the road trip through the Deep South where we get to know little but see a lot. Herzog in Stroszek, where chickens confound us. Polanski made the most American film of all, working from a script by Robert Towne, but his Chinatown extends a little beyond the familiar reaches of neo-noir into the untravelled; dusty orange groves and acquifers late at night. Each in their peculiar way reveal a little of the fabric of the larger world. And it's always tied up to the landscape, always the landscape that draws us in, big and small. The endless stretch of asphalt through sunbaked desert, the motel's neon sign flashing against purpleorange horizons. A gas station in the middle of nowhere. I understand that these are the familiar sights of everyday commute for a sizeable portion of Americans, or a short drive away from home, but for us on the other side they are the source of endless allure - aptly, a world most of us Europeans have known through movies. It's not about the gas station then, but about the 'middle of nowhere'  a valuable space of contemplation missing from the Old Europe dissicated under so much time and history. Having sampled the familiar moviescapes of Los Angeles or Texas, these films often take to the desert, a further retreat towards the hermitage where a clear vision is possible. Wenders's film is true to all these things. He begins from the desert and emerges back into the known world, meaning whatever communion with the vastness took place is already behind us. Tellingly, the rugged protagonist emerges mute. The very title is about two worlds (of which there are many in the film), and the attempt to bridge the endless inbetween. The 'slice of life' is about familiar contrivance, like out of daytime soap. But something tells me the film didn't sweep the French at Cannes for its moral dilemmas, the French who so valued the escape into the dream world of noir and western 50 years ago. The moviescapes, again as perceived from the other side; rural America bathed in luminous phantasmagoria, a gas station filmed in bright reds and lime greens. Or a suburban landscape so amazingly bland, as it unfolds from behind the windshield of a moving car. That amazing cat house, itself a mysterious house of fictions where two worlds are brought together in disguise. It could have been quite something if Wenders understood how a frame functions. He knows how to set them up, but not quite what they do. Inside the cat house, for example, the corridor lined-up with curtains each granting passage  one of the most inspired codas of cinematic self-reference. Wenders instead gives us long monologues, he explains too much that we don't need to know. I understand that he values emotional consonance - where I differ, is that I'm drawn towards films that operate or dismantle at the level of perception rather than feeling. It's good though, as artifice breathing life into cinematic space. As a piece of abstract soul, seen through the road darkly.

    'Paris, Texas', mind you, is not edge-of-the-seat viewing. It is not thrill-a-minute cinema; neither will your adrenaline be activated every 5 or 10 minutes. It is a slow, introspective study, through the interplay of just 5 characters, of solitude, and loneliness, and its gradual fading away ... of the ingratiation of the archetypal 'outsider' into the fold of mankind, once again ... even if, at the end, the wheel turns full circle ... Harry Dean Stanton, even if he underplays his role to textbook perfection, straddles the film like a colossus from start to finish. A complex character if there ever was one, it is Stanton's triumph that he imbues it with shades which make it more comprehensible and less dense ... and the mercurial Natassja Kinski, who gets barely half an hour of screen time, lights it up as only she can. The penultimate scene between the two (I won't reveal the details here) provides one of the most intense picturizations of the husband-wife relationship that I, at least, have seen. So far as performances go, it would be unfair not to put in a word for the adorable Hunter Henderson, who plays the couple's son Hunter, and illumines every scene he is in. And yet, perhaps, 'Paris, Texas' would not have been what it is without Ry Cooder's haunting background score ... perhaps the greatest example of the use of the guitar in the background music of any film, to devastating effect. Not popcorn viewing for sure, but if you're in the mood for serious, affecting cinema, don't miss 'Paris, Texas'.

    Wim Wenders's Paris,Texas is a film that is narrated through road trips. An utterly lost man (in every sense of the word) is tracked down by his brother and reunited with his son. On discovering a part of his old self, the man takes on a journey to bring his son back with his estranged mother. What the viewer doesn't know till the very end of the movie is as to why this family had been separated in the first place. The film's pace is quite in contrast to that of the fast and frequent road trips on screen. Although the slowness and did get to my head at times, I found the film quite riveting on the whole. The barren roads of Texas contrasted against the busy highways of Houston is an interesting feature of this film. At heart, "Paris, Texas" is an intense film about human separation and more importantly, reunion.

    Wenders, M&uuml;ller, Shepard, Cooder, Stanton, Stockwell. Could there be a better combination  and concentration!  of talent? Film is indeed poetry, and this is one of the most beautiful poems of parenthood I've seen. Not explicit, preachy, but otherworldly, subtle, comic, bittersweet. The alienation from one's own self, all of this internal, has its visual counterpoint first in the concept of walkabout in the open space, the desert, the quiet; then in the urbanity of modern life, the closed space, the airplane, the noise. Change, both internal and external (appearance such as the rugged beard, mutism), reflected in the road movie. His self-discovery is actually our discovery, not only of him but of the movie. Travis has two beginnings: as explained by him, he was most likely conceived in Paris, Texas. It was his first beginning, the film his second. Stanton is sublime. His ability to convey meaning and emotion through the slightest gestures and expressions is unprecedented. And yet, at the same time, his ability to conceal meaning and emotion is just as evocatively effective  his face is a blank, his eyes devoid of anything one might connect to, finding meaning from. That lunch they're having together before hitting the road, father and son, somehow reifies the film's many narratives for me. There we have the walkabout/journey/highway and family/loss/past at an intersection. And it's a perfectly beautiful moment.

    First of all i just want to say WOW,what a great movie. I,ve seen a lot of them and this one just blew my mind completely. The beginning is a marvelous opening with Ry Cooder's wonderful blues guitar (it is one of the best soundtrack's iv'e ever heard). And who's that? Well if it isn't the presence of Harry Dean Stanton in his best role to this day(the performance is really captivating),as he wanders to the path of nothing in the lonely desert. He soon makes his way in to a bar and passes out,and thats when the movie "begins" if you know what i mean. The man we just saw has no name,no past,nothing. Soon the doctor that takes him in finds a number which is his brother(Dean Stockwell). The brother rushes down to the deserts of Texas and finds a hurting and scarred man with no life in him. One of the many brilliant things about this movie is that Stanton doesn't say a word until 20 minutes in to this film,and you get to do some real character study of him in this time. We soon find out Stanton has a son and that his brother has taken care of him for the years Stanton's been gone. When they arrive to LA,many things happen very quickly for Stanton. He meets the son that doesn't remember him(Hunter Carson),Stockwells wife(Aurore Clement in one of her best roles,i haven't seen her in much,and she deserves more,because she is a very good actor) and later,when they see film clips,we find out that Stanton also has a long lost wife in which he remembers. But Carson and Stanton really hit it off as father and son in a memorable 3 minutes where Stanton jokes around with the Son. Stanton is determined to find the wife but only hear rumors of where she is which is that she is working in Houston.Pretty shockingly,Stanton and Carson make there way to Houston without telling Stockwell or Clement. The finest scene of ALL,is when Stanton finds The wife(Nastassja Kinski in such a gripping and flawless performance that makes this movie a masterpiece). There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computer,and the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie. Everything about it is great,the cinematography,the acting,the soundtrack,the melancholic "thing" about it.It is really worth it.

    Four years after going missing Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out of the vast South Texas desert. After collapsing in a saloon a doctor treats him and discovers his brother's business card in his wallet. Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) flies to Texas to meet his brother and has many questions for him. Travis appears to be mute however and doesn't eat, sleep or talk for days. When he finally opens his mouth it is revealed that he remembers little about the last four years. Dean takes Travis back to his L.A. home where he and his wife Anne (Aurore Clement) have been looking after Travis' seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson) since Travis' wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) left him with them and disappeared herself. Travis has to try and re-assimilate himself back into every day life and reconnect with his young son before setting out to try and find his estranged wife. In many ways this film reminded me of director Wim Wenders 1976 film Kings of the Road. Both films take place mostly on the road in quiet, almost desolate places with two characters who barely know each other. This film is more about the family unit and loss but is equally as good. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes as well as numerous other prizes and it's fantastic. The story is tremendous. It was written by noted playwright/actor Sam Shepard and is a wonderful tale of isolation, loss and redemption. It unfolds at an incredibly slow pace by modern standards but is thoroughly gripping, divulging enough to keep you on tenterhooks but never telling you everything. I was completely gripped the whole way through. As well as a great plot the films other standout feature is its score which is performed on the slide guitar by Ry Cooper. It is haunting and repetitive but in a good way. It worked very well with the plot and the on screen visuals which were also exemplary. Frequent Wenders cinematographer Robby Muller creates some stunning sights of wide open, desolate vistas and intricate and interesting internal shots of bars, motels and houses. Some of the shots seem to last for minutes but that is part of what makes it so beautiful. The film is a joy to look at. On the acting side the film is once again terrific. Harry Dean Stanton is superb when playing the mute in early scenes but becomes more vocal as the film progresses. His performance overall was brilliant. His son, played by Hunter Carson was also excellent in his first film role, although he looked unnervingly like a young Jodie Foster. Supporting actors Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clement and especially Nastassja Kinski were also without fault. This is a film which might not appeal to everyone due to its slow nature but I loved it. I was mesmerised by the long, single camera shots in which the dialogue just went on and on and the cinematography was breathtaking. This isn't far off a perfect film and one that I'd recommend to anyone as long as their favourite film wasn't Transformers 2. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    the film starts slowly, keeping pace with Travis, who is wandering the desert aimlessly on foot. Travis has been a lost drifter for 4 years in the Mojave Desert and now appears to be mute, probably from suffering severe mental trauma, until his brother eventually found him and convinced him to go back home in LA. upon his arrival, Travis is gonna try to get his life together, reconnect with his son and brother and maybe right some wrongs from the past. Travis seems to come out of nowhere, and heading nowhere and at the end of the film, he disappears into the night, to an unknown destination.. since the beginning, there's a sentiment of coming back to the origins of cinema; i've read a review on the film that pointed out how Travis's journey responds to the evolution of American cinema (German director Wim Wenders's fascination for American cinema is obvious, as the very title of the film refers metaphorically to the Europe-USA rapport), and i can see how that's true seeing as Travis and the film go gradually from silence to speech, from open vast landscapes to more enclosed spaces defined by doors and walls, from desert to peep-show booths. Paris-Texas provides the possibility to see raw reality, uncategorized. Travis does not see the world as a coherent system that he's implicated to, but rather as a succession of moments and he's the spectator, which implies loneliness and alienation. the viewer follows with sincere emotion the journey of a father and a husband, lost in his past and searching for identity. the film is drenched in highly engaging, bittersweet atmosphere, arranged remarkably by the cinematography and the beautiful slide guitar score setting the mood. inducing touching scenes of characters communicating on an honest level, and one truly great scene in Travis's and Jane's conversation, the film represents the perfect balance between a good script, images of such beauty that they become paintings, actors that give life to their characters and music that goes so well that it becomes the shadow of the images. one of the most moving films i've seen.

    I regret watching this movie. The characters and performances are shallow and irritating. The cinematography is nice, but the direction is bland, substance-less and devoid of style. I understand that a lot of people who feel inclined to review Paris, Texas are so inclined because they really like the movie. ... but having just watched it, partially based on seeing so many gushing reviews here, I really feel that a contrary review is in order. My friend and I both just watched it and both regret it. Here are some of our mutual favorites, for reference, so you know who we are: In A Lonely Place, Chinatown, Brazil, Taxi Driver, Maltese Falcon, Blue Velvet, Stroszek, Persona... We both agree that Paris, Texas is THE most regrettable viewing experience we have shared. For additional reference of what this ranking means to us I will list other things we've watched besides our favorites, all of which we regret less (if at all) than Paris, Texas: The Quatermass Trilogy, Dune, High Sierra, Aquaboy cartoons, Melancholia, Plan 9 from Outer Space, the Sinister Urge, Gates of Heaven... I would say that if you happen to be one of the folks who will end up liking this movie, then you would have a good feeling after watching the first bit of it. But if you start watching it and feel irritable after only 15 minutes, you should stop watching it because that's the movie. That is what I wish I had heard from a trusted source several hours ago.

    Great. My first review. It's too bad I start with Paris, Texas because I have only one word for it: BORING. I watched a few hours earlier Coen's The Man Who Wasn't There. So, with a very good state of mind, I got to watch Paris, Texas, mostly because of the good reviews. The beginning was good: nice frames, clean and wide views in the country and a mysterious man with no past. I thought that should be watchable. I was mistaken. After an hour I had to go to sleep. I thought I was tired, but it was the movie. I didn't like Travis at all. No intellect. I see people like him everyday and they're no surprise. His kid is even smarter than him. If the intention was to see a simple man's life with his simple man's decisions then the film makers succeeded. But I think this recipe is for 5 year old's. Luckily there is a Forward button and I watched the predictable ending. 5 is merely for cinematography and a few good melodramatic scenes.

    Throughout the entirety of Paris, Texas's two-and-a-half-hour running time (and not one minute of it wasted), it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears, he's animalistic, not talking, motivated only by his strange, unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires, but there's always that wild, uncertain edge to his performance, so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character, as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle -- the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon, the story of his own conception, the falsity of a peep show, the million artificial lights of Los Angeles, and the obsession that gives the film its name, the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries, but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions, and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again, seeing his son end ex-wife embrace from a distance. Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering. All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image.
