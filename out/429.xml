    "There must be security for all or no one is secure."- Klaatu, to the world's leaders at the conclusion of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Here is the ne plus ultra for sci-fi movies. It does not pander to the child in us like E.T. It does not befuddle with dazzling images like 2001. Though it does present a threat from outer space, it does not take the form of a drooling, acid-for-blood whatsis with razor fangs and a hunger for human flesh. Instead, it proposes that there are indeed humanoid lifeforms in existence off the Earth with, dare I write it, powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (though Klaatu can't fly and is in no way bulletproof). THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North's fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man's capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie's urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto..... (And please don't waste your time with the utter failure that is the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake; just revel in the enduring excellence of the original).

    Welcome to Earth (Smack!), now go home! About 15 minutes into this movie, that's what I wanted to see some Earthling say(and do) to the alien Klaatu, who, after only a couple hours on Earth, was throwing his weight around and acting like he owned the place. Of course, "Welcome to Earth!" was the line famously uttered by Will Smith in "Independence Day" as he's punching an invading alien in the head, but I guess Earthlings had more spunk and defiance in the 1990's than in the early 1950's when this movie was set. Klaatu, at this point, is demanding (among other things) an audience with all the world's leaders, indifferent, apparently, to whether we could or even wanted to do such a thing. At this point he was talking to some diplomat type, who should have shown some backbone and said something like: "Who the hell crowned you Emperor of the Universe? You show up on our planet, unannounced and uninvited, giving no indication whether you were hostile or friendly, pull out a device without telling us what it is, making an already nervous bunch of soldiers even more nervous, one of them shoots it, slightly injuring you in the process, we apologize profusely and take you into one of our hospitals, and then you start telling us what YOU want US to do!" Or he could just skip most of that and say "Welcome to Earth (smack!), now go home!" At this point Klaatu had merely been pushy, overbearing, and a bit condescending, but things soon got much worse. About halfway through the film he is meeting with a scientist. At first they just talk science stuff, specifically how to solve an equation the professor was working on. But he soon gets to the meat of the matter. They don't like that we have nuclear weapons and are working on rockets. Their fear is we will soon use them on other planets, never mind no one on Earth has suggested any such thing. So, to defend against this (nonexistent) threat, they have robots that can kill everything on the planet, humans, animals, everything. At which point the scientist is in awe that such technology exists, apparently missing entirely the moral (or, more accurately, utterly immoral) nature of such a proposition. The scientist, like the diplomat, is apparently a wimp and lacks the guts to stand up to this spacegoing threatener of global genocide. What are we to think of a form of "Justice" administered by planet smashing robots who apparently cannot or will not distinguish between guilty and innocent, who will engage in mass murder on a scale unimagined even by a Hitler or Stalin, and all out of fear of a species which, according to Klaatu and his kind, are way behind them in terms of technology? Indeed, if Klaatu really wanted peace with Earth, he could have gone about it the civilized way. Announced in advance via radio communication that he was coming so we would have been prepared, requested permission before landing, and then asked (not demanded) that we sign a peace treaty with them. That's the civilized method of handling such matters, showing respect for the people he was dealing with, as opposed to the heavy handed approach he used in the movie. Ironically, although this movie is clearly intended to have a message, the true message may be the opposite of what the filmmakers intended. Namely, that totalitarianism done in the name of "Idealism" may in fact be worse than totalitarianism served straight up. Klaatu is presented as an idealist, a man (or alien) of peace, but in reality his morality is that of a thug, the classic bully's line of "Do as I say, or I'll bash your face in!" Give me the aliens of "Independence Day" over Klaatu and his ilk any time. They, too, threaten to wipe us out, but at least they're not claiming to do it in the name of "Peace". Anyway, so much for that. Putting aside the rather disturbing moral and philosophical issues raised by this movie, how does it rate purely as entertainment? On that scale, pretty good. The story itself is simple and well told, the acting generally solid. Patricia Neal is the only real star in this movie, and it shows, since her acting is on a level well above the rest. The filmmakers seemed to recognize the low level of special effects available at the time, so, for example, they simply have KLaatu played by a human actor with no attempts to make him look "Alien", not even such gimmicks as Spock style pointy ears. The ship is your basic flying saucer, no attempt is made to explain its propulsion system nor other forms of alien technology. This was the early 1950's and the science fiction movie genre was in its infancy. Later movies, like the Star Wars, Terminator, Alien, and Matrix series would be far more sophisticated, but then they had earlier movies such as this one to learn from. 5/10

    While I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, I watched this classic for the first time last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it! Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu, a tall, dignified alien who travels 250 million miles from an unnamed planet to Washington, D.C. He is accompanied by Gort (Lock Martin), a gigantic robot that can destroy weapons with a powerful laser beam. Klaatu takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray). (Incidentally, Gray would later play Bud Anderson in the hit TV series "Father Knows Best".) In summary, Klaatu warns the people on earth that they must either pursue peace or face obliteration. For me, everything about this movie meshes very well - the intelligent plot, the superb cast, the eerie soundtrack, and the modest special effects. Trivia fans will note the obvious parallels between Klaatu and Jesus, e.g. Mr. Carpenter is Klaatu's alias, he prophesies destruction on earth, he dies and later comes back to life. The only thing I wish the screenwriters had changed would be to include Bobby in the final scene - especially considering that he and Klaatu become good friends during the alien's stay in Washington. Other than that, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a sci-fi masterpiece that just gets better with age! Yes, technology has changed, but the film's message remains highly relevant to this day.

    This movie is good, but not great. The movie's theme is obvious - war is bad, peace is good, and the human race better listen up, or else. Michael Rennie plays the principal role with dignity, which prevents the movie from becoming a spoof. Hugh Marlowe plays what is perhaps the most realistic character in the story and whose character reveals the kind of character flaws which have brought the human race to the brink of destruction. The special effects are surprisingly good. What is not that good is the contrived nature of the story with its obvious political spin. Also, the response to the alien's arrival is surprisingly understated. True, the alien is shot, twice, but given his unexpected arrival and the weapon he brought, a robot that could destroy the earth, such a response is not implausible. That is, the humans have cause to feel alarmed which this movie seems to suggest is an overreaction. The alien's unveiled threat of destruction should have been enough to send this alien packing. Any message delivered at the point of gun, so to speak, is a message that is not worth its weight in words. Now, the movie is well made - the story is straight forward and the acting is strong. This movie had great value as a cinematic antique.

    "Klaatu barada nikto!" When it comes to the Sci-Fi sub-genre of "Alien Visitation" flicks, I honestly don't think that they get much more intelligent and thought-provoking as this sparkling gem from 1951. If there are other such "Alien Visitation" flicks out there that do promote this satisfying level of genuine intelligence in their stories, then I would sure like to hear about them. (Please feel free to message me with their titles) Impressively directed by Robert Wise, The Day The Earth Stood Still (TDTESS) actually did manage to deliver quite a seamless and evocative blend of the ordinary melded very nicely with the fantastic. This is the sort of motion picture that really gives the viewer the pleasant opportunity of actually getting to know (and, maybe, even like) its characters. Even the 10 year-old kid, Bobby Benson, was a likable sort. And, believe me, I usually loathe kids in movies. They almost never fail to be totally irksome and nothing but spoiled, little, snot-nosed brats. Yet, here in TDTESS, the young Billy Gray's portrayal of Bobby was very much like a literal breath of fresh air. This youthful, wide-eyed actor really seemed to understand his character and make him interesting. Anyways - Traveling at warp-speed (that's 4000 mph.) and taking a 5-month, 250 million mile journey to get here, TDTESS's story has Klaatu, the very distinguished and cool-headed alien, arriving in Washington, DC in order to deliver his dire, top-priority message to all of us naughty-naughty Earthlings. After being observed for many years by other outer-planetary civilizations, it has been determined that (through the discovery of atomic power) we Earthlings, with our unbridled destructiveness, have become a very-very serious threat to the overall peace and security of the other planets which exist in this endlessly vast universe. Klaatu must now address all nations of the Earth and somehow convince one and all to cease with these violent ways, or else face some mighty devastating consequences. You can bet that if Klaatu's firm words of warning can't induce us Earthlings to reconsider our ways, then, believe me, Gort, the all-powerful robot, definitely has his own special brand of persuasion that doesn't take "No" for an answer. Trust me - In spite of its flaws, TDTESS is, without question, a classic Sci-Fi/Thriller that's really worth its weight in gold. And "Klaatu barada nikto!" to you, too! P.S. - This film's 2008 remake was an absolutely despicable desecration of the highest order.

    I first saw this on NBC's "Saturday Night at the Movies". I never saw it on a big screen. The robot, "Gort" was not as scary on a 21" TV set, but when his "laser eye" opened it gave me chills and it still does. Remarkably simple special effects by today's standards yet highly effective. That "creepy" classic music. Gaunt and tall (6'4") Michael Rennie looks like an alien. Sam Jaffe is the perfect "Einstein-like" eccentric scientist. Patricia Neal, Billy Gray and Hugh Marlowe are credible as the supporting cast in the most unusual sci-fi film ever made. The studio "sold" it as a "monster" movie, which it never was. The robot carries a blond-haired bimbo (in a sultry red dress) in its arms on the lobby cards. Patricia was not blond and did not wear a "red" dress, though it's hard to tell in a b/w movie. It's one of the most thoughtful fantasy films ever made, although not perfect. The "speeded-up" film in the panic scenes looks very fake. The Army is portrayed as brainless and heartless. Poor Gort had wardrobe issues: You can see his air holes and zipper. Even the support "wires" as he carries Patricia back to the spaceship. The Earth doesn't really "stand still". The aliens just neutralize most electricity. That's not very scary, or is it? The movie's "message" is still relevant after 60 years. The people of Earth must learn to live in peace or someday we will all be blasted off the Earth. Whether we will kill ourselves off or are vaporized by alien robots like "Gort" still remains to be seen. A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.

    I can see why critics are giving this one a lot of positive reviews. It's a sci-fi film with substance and way ahead of it's time. It has elements of humanity and what we take for granted. Even in today's society people are just mad about the world and after each others throats. Even if this movie was made in the 50's the nature of human beings didn't change one bit but gotten worse. I can tell why this movie stands out even today and how it was such a unique movie when it first came out. It doesn't have that generic monstrous looking aliens with ray guns or that super friendly alien thing going on. In fact the alien that comes from outer space is the most human like alien I have ever seen. I am not saying this is a positive or negative aspect to the alien genre. But the only difference seems to be the fact that the alien Klaatu has more knowledge and better technology. I thought this movie would have been better though if it showed Klaatue getting to have more of a bonding and relationship with the human race. He does to a degree but not that much with just the scene of him hanging out in Washington D.C. with a boy. Now to be honest I didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining but it does have substance and a message. And I thought the ending was great. It's one of those endings where the message is clear but leaves it up to the audiences. 7/10

    Being a science fiction lover, I forced myself to see this movie. Fact remains that in our time, such movie can not carry our imagination away anymore... but it's interesting to think that in those years (1950's) it probably did! When seeing it now, I get bored and often thought "clichee", but the reason for that is that this was probably a trend setting movie for many SF stories later on. Also, I was wondering the link between how "the world/society/politics" would act in the real world vs in the movie; and how that has changed over time. IN the movie I often got irritated by thinking "damn, how stupid can they (the world) be to act in such foolish way (shooting an a friendly and innocent alien), it seems so logic that that is not the right thing to do now, but back then... it was maybe different (that's just one example). Anyway. I gave it a 7. It's always hard to judge an old movie. If today was 1955, then I would maybe have given it a 10?

    Science Fiction explores endless possibilities, in particular the future and advancement of mankind. During the 50s however, the genre was not given the credit it deserves. Works of cinematic science fiction lumped into the B-movie class and no one ever expected much of them. Back then, people had yet to realize the genre's full potential, which would later become evident in Star Trek and Star Wars. It wasn't until Robert Wise, indisputably one of films most accomplished directors made The Day the Earth Stood Still and delivered an approach like no other in science fiction that the genre achieved a whole new level of appreciation. As an avid fan of science fiction, I have been familiar with this movie for a long time, but I never understood just how impactful and revolutionary it was until now. In the movie, humanity was at the dawn of a new age. With the discovery of nuclear power, it was thought that mankind would soon be ready to explore the depths of outer space and discover that we are not alone in the universe. But the human race, given its fallible and conflicting nature, was not yet ready to take the next step without risking the annihilation of the human race. It falls to the humanoid extra-terrestrial being Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to warn the leaders of the planet Earth of the dangerous path they were on. Realizing that the leaders are unwilling to cooperate, Klaatu is forced to go into hiding. He takes refuge in a boarding house under the alias "Mr. Carpenter" and lives among a family that personifies the goodness of human nature. He realizes that someday soon, humans may be ready for the great beyond. Some of the effects, although crude by today's standards, are very appealing, but Robert Wise's film is not about how spectacular special effects can be, nor does it adhere to the conventional formula of human heroes triumphing over villainous aliens. The brilliance is in the many themes that Wise develops in a world at a time of warfare and fear. One of my favorite moments involves Klaatu and the young Bobby (Billy Gray) as Klaatu and the rest of the viewers are given a glimpse of 50s lifestyle. Klaatu perfectly captures the essence of being a stranger in a strange land as alien to the human world as humans are to his own. Klaatu sees the world through the perspective of Bobby. Looking through the eyes of an innocent child is often the best way to view life. Backed up by a strong script and adrenaline pumping tension, the theme of human goodness and the need to emphasize the better side of human nature is expressed beautifully with Robert Wise's unique blend of irresistible charm and drama features. Robert Wise boldly went where no filmmaker had gone before with The Day the Earth Stood Still, giving us a science fiction movie that made people question the nature of mankind and the direction we are heading. In the post war/cold war era, a time of desperation and terror, Wise ushered a ray of hope and delivered a small glimpse of Sci-fi potential that future generations would build on. People would never look at the genre the same way again and for that Mr. Wise has my everlasting gratitude.

    When a spaceship lands in Washington DC it is surrounded by an army fearing it may be dangerous. After a couple of hours it opens and a man in a strange space suit emerges; as he approaches the soldiers with his hand outstretched a solder thinks he is preparing to fire a weapon so shoots him. After this a giant robot comes out and fires a beam that destroys the weapons aimed at it. The man, named Klaatu, is taken to hospital and after he is treated he says he must talk to all world leaders to deliver a message; the problem is the world it too divided for leaders to agree to such a demand. Klaatu is told he must stay in the hospital but he escapes creating a panic as everybody wonders where the dangerous spaceman has gone he has taken up residence with a local family where he rents a room under the name of Carpenter. He makes friends with the young boy of the family and from him learns the identity of the leading scientist so pays him a visit. He agrees to arrange a meeting of world scientists but by now people are starting to get suspicious of him and, as he warns, if he dies the robot could destroy everything on Earth. This film is rightfully considered a classic; many things we see here would be repeated in films for decades to come what alien invasion film these days doesn't feature reaction shots from people around the world? It makes a refreshing change that the 'invader' is not really part of an invasion force; he is just there to warn the world that more powerful planets see Earth's development of rockets and nuclear weapons as a threat that will be eliminated if necessary. The film nicely captures the paranoia of the cold war as almost everybody fears Klaatu. Klaatu himself provides the voice of reason as he tries to persuade people of the importance of his message; some people listen of course but not those that matter and his demonstration of power just makes the authorities more determined to kill him. If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must see; obviously some aspects are slightly dated but it is far less dated than one might expect from as sixty year old black and white film; I'm sure that sixty years from now people will be watching this not the recent remake.

    Welcome to Earth (Smack!), now go home! About 15 minutes into this movie, that's what I wanted to see some Earthling say(and do) to the alien Klaatu, who, after only a couple hours on Earth, was throwing his weight around and acting like he owned the place.

The story itself is simple and well told, the acting generally solid. Patricia Neal is the only real star in this movie, and it shows, since her acting is on a level well above the rest. The filmmakers seemed to recognize the low level of special effects available at the time, so, for example, they simply have KLaatu played by a human actor with no attempts to make him look "Alien", not even such gimmicks as Spock style pointy ears. The ship is your basic flying saucer, no attempt is made to explain its propulsion system nor other forms of alien technology. This was the early 1950's and the science fiction movie genre was in its infancy. Later movies, like the Star Wars, Terminator, Alien, and Matrix series would be far more sophisticated, but then they had earlier movies such as this one to learn from. 5/10

    While I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, I watched this classic for the first time last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it! Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu, a tall, dignified alien who travels 250 million miles from an unnamed planet to Washington, D.C. He is accompanied by Gort (Lock Martin), a gigantic robot that can destroy weapons with a powerful laser beam. Klaatu takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray). (Incidentally, Gray would later play Bud Anderson in the hit TV series "Father Knows Best".) In summary, Klaatu warns the people on earth that they must either pursue peace or face obliteration. For me, everything about this movie meshes very well - the intelligent plot, the superb cast, the eerie soundtrack, and the modest special effects. Trivia fans will note the obvious parallels between Klaatu and Jesus, e.g. Mr. Carpenter is Klaatu's alias, he prophesies destruction on earth, he dies and later comes back to life. The only thing I wish the screenwriters had changed would be to include Bobby in the final scene - especially considering that he and Klaatu become good friends during the alien's stay in Washington. Other than that, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a sci-fi masterpiece that just gets better with age! Yes, technology has changed, but the film's message remains highly relevant to this day.

    This movie is good, but not great. The movie's theme is obvious - war is bad, peace is good, and the human race better listen up, or else. Michael Rennie plays the principal role with dignity, which prevents the movie from becoming a spoof. Hugh Marlowe plays what is perhaps the most realistic character in the story and whose character reveals the kind of character flaws which have brought the human race to the brink of destruction. The special effects are surprisingly good. What is not that good is the contrived nature of the story with its obvious political spin. Also, the response to the alien's arrival is surprisingly understated. True, the alien is shot, twice, but given his unexpected arrival and the weapon he brought, a robot that could destroy the earth, such a response is not implausible. That is, the humans have cause to feel alarmed which this movie seems to suggest is an overreaction. The alien's unveiled threat of destruction should have been enough to send this alien packing. Any message delivered at the point of gun, so to speak, is a message that is not worth its weight in words. Now, the movie is well made - the story is straight forward and the acting is strong. This movie had great value as a cinematic antique.

    "Klaatu barada nikto!" When it comes to the Sci-Fi sub-genre of "Alien Visitation" flicks, I honestly don't think that they get much more intelligent and thought-provoking as this sparkling gem from 1951. If there are other such "Alien Visitation" flicks out there that do promote this satisfying level of genuine intelligence in their stories, then I would sure like to hear about them. (Please feel free to message me with their titles) Impressively directed by Robert Wise, The Day The Earth Stood Still (TDTESS) actually did manage to deliver quite a seamless and evocative blend of the ordinary melded very nicely with the fantastic. This is the sort of motion picture that really gives the viewer the pleasant opportunity of actually getting to know (and, maybe, even like) its characters. Even the 10 year-old kid, Bobby Benson, was a likable sort. And, believe me, I usually loathe kids in movies. They almost never fail to be totally irksome and nothing but spoiled, little, snot-nosed brats. Yet, here in TDTESS, the young Billy Gray's portrayal of Bobby was very much like a literal breath of fresh air. This youthful, wide-eyed actor really seemed to understand his character and make him interesting. Anyways - Traveling at warp-speed (that's 4000 mph.) and taking a 5-month, 250 million mile journey to get here, TDTESS's story has Klaatu, the very distinguished and cool-headed alien, arriving in Washington, DC in order to deliver his dire, top-priority message to all of us naughty-naughty Earthlings. After being observed for many years by other outer-planetary civilizations, it has been determined that (through the discovery of atomic power) we Earthlings, with our unbridled destructiveness, have become a very-very serious threat to the overall peace and security of the other planets which exist in this endlessly vast universe. Klaatu must now address all nations of the Earth and somehow convince one and all to cease with these violent ways, or else face some mighty devastating consequences. You can bet that if Klaatu's firm words of warning can't induce us Earthlings to reconsider our ways, then, believe me, Gort, the all-powerful robot, definitely has his own special brand of persuasion that doesn't take "No" for an answer. Trust me - In spite of its flaws, TDTESS is, without question, a classic Sci-Fi/Thriller that's really worth its weight in gold. And "Klaatu barada nikto!" to you, too! P.S. - This film's 2008 remake was an absolutely despicable desecration of the highest order.

    I first saw this on NBC's "Saturday Night at the Movies". I never saw it on a big screen. The robot, "Gort" was not as scary on a 21" TV set, but when his "laser eye" opened it gave me chills and it still does. Remarkably simple special effects by today's standards yet highly effective. That "creepy" classic music. Gaunt and tall (6'4") Michael Rennie looks like an alien. Sam Jaffe is the perfect "Einstein-like" eccentric scientist. Patricia Neal, Billy Gray and Hugh Marlowe are credible as the supporting cast in the most unusual sci-fi film ever made. The studio "sold" it as a "monster" movie, which it never was. The robot carries a blond-haired bimbo (in a sultry red dress) in its arms on the lobby cards. Patricia was not blond and did not wear a "red" dress, though it's hard to tell in a b/w movie. It's one of the most thoughtful fantasy films ever made, although not perfect. The "speeded-up" film in the panic scenes looks very fake. The Army is portrayed as brainless and heartless. Poor Gort had wardrobe issues: You can see his air holes and zipper. Even the support "wires" as he carries Patricia back to the spaceship. The Earth doesn't really "stand still". The aliens just neutralize most electricity. That's not very scary, or is it? The movie's "message" is still relevant after 60 years. The people of Earth must learn to live in peace or someday we will all be blasted off the Earth. Whether we will kill ourselves off or are vaporized by alien robots like "Gort" still remains to be seen. A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.

    I can see why critics are giving this one a lot of positive reviews. It's a sci-fi film with substance and way ahead of it's time. It has elements of humanity and what we take for granted. Even in today's society people are just mad about the world and after each others throats. Even if this movie was made in the 50's the nature of human beings didn't change one bit but gotten worse. I can tell why this movie stands out even today and how it was such a unique movie when it first came out. It doesn't have that generic monstrous looking aliens with ray guns or that super friendly alien thing going on. In fact the alien that comes from outer space is the most human like alien I have ever seen. I am not saying this is a positive or negative aspect to the alien genre. But the only difference seems to be the fact that the alien Klaatu has more knowledge and better technology. I thought this movie would have been better though if it showed Klaatue getting to have more of a bonding and relationship with the human race. He does to a degree but not that much with just the scene of him hanging out in Washington D.C. with a boy. Now to be honest I didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining but it does have substance and a message. And I thought the ending was great. It's one of those endings where the message is clear but leaves it up to the audiences. 7/10

    Being a science fiction lover, I forced myself to see this movie. Fact remains that in our time, such movie can not carry our imagination away anymore... but it's interesting to think that in those years (1950's) it probably did! When seeing it now, I get bored and often thought "clichee", but the reason for that is that this was probably a trend setting movie for many SF stories later on. Also, I was wondering the link between how "the world/society/politics" would act in the real world vs in the movie; and how that has changed over time. IN the movie I often got irritated by thinking "damn, how stupid can they (the world) be to act in such foolish way (shooting an a friendly and innocent alien), it seems so logic that that is not the right thing to do now, but back then... it was maybe different (that's just one example). Anyway. I gave it a 7. It's always hard to judge an old movie. If today was 1955, then I would maybe have given it a 10?

    Science Fiction explores endless possibilities, in particular the future and advancement of mankind. During the 50s however, the genre was not given the credit it deserves. Works of cinematic science fiction lumped into the B-movie class and no one ever expected much of them. Back then, people had yet to realize the genre's full potential, which would later become evident in Star Trek and Star Wars. It wasn't until Robert Wise, indisputably one of films most accomplished directors made The Day the Earth Stood Still and delivered an approach like no other in science fiction that the genre achieved a whole new level of appreciation. As an avid fan of science fiction, I have been familiar with this movie for a long time, but I never understood just how impactful and revolutionary it was until now. In the movie, humanity was at the dawn of a new age. With the discovery of nuclear power, it was thought that mankind would soon be ready to explore the depths of outer space and discover that we are not alone in the universe. But the human race, given its fallible and conflicting nature, was not yet ready to take the next step without risking the annihilation of the human race. It falls to the humanoid extra-terrestrial being Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to warn the leaders of the planet Earth of the dangerous path they were on. Realizing that the leaders are unwilling to cooperate, Klaatu is forced to go into hiding. He takes refuge in a boarding house under the alias "Mr. Carpenter" and lives among a family that personifies the goodness of human nature. He realizes that someday soon, humans may be ready for the great beyond. Some of the effects, although crude by today's standards, are very appealing, but Robert Wise's film is not about how spectacular special effects can be, nor does it adhere to the conventional formula of human heroes triumphing over villainous aliens. The brilliance is in the many themes that Wise develops in a world at a time of warfare and fear. One of my favorite moments involves Klaatu and the young Bobby (Billy Gray) as Klaatu and the rest of the viewers are given a glimpse of 50s lifestyle. Klaatu perfectly captures the essence of being a stranger in a strange land as alien to the human world as humans are to his own. Klaatu sees the world through the perspective of Bobby. Looking through the eyes of an innocent child is often the best way to view life. Backed up by a strong script and adrenaline pumping tension, the theme of human goodness and the need to emphasize the better side of human nature is expressed beautifully with Robert Wise's unique blend of irresistible charm and drama features. Robert Wise boldly went where no filmmaker had gone before with The Day the Earth Stood Still, giving us a science fiction movie that made people question the nature of mankind and the direction we are heading. In the post war/cold war era, a time of desperation and terror, Wise ushered a ray of hope and delivered a small glimpse of Sci-fi potential that future generations would build on. People would never look at the genre the same way again and for that Mr. Wise has my everlasting gratitude.

    When a spaceship lands in Washington DC it is surrounded by an army fearing it may be dangerous. After a couple of hours it opens and a man in a strange space suit emerges; as he approaches the soldiers with his hand outstretched a solder thinks he is preparing to fire a weapon so shoots him. After this a giant robot comes out and fires a beam that destroys the weapons aimed at it. The man, named Klaatu, is taken to hospital and after he is treated he says he must talk to all world leaders to deliver a message; the problem is the world it too divided for leaders to agree to such a demand. Klaatu is told he must stay in the hospital but he escapes creating a panic as everybody wonders where the dangerous spaceman has gone he has taken up residence with a local family where he rents a room under the name of Carpenter. He makes friends with the young boy of the family and from him learns the identity of the leading scientist so pays him a visit. He agrees to arrange a meeting of world scientists but by now people are starting to get suspicious of him and, as he warns, if he dies the robot could destroy everything on Earth. This film is rightfully considered a classic; many things we see here would be repeated in films for decades to come what alien invasion film these days doesn't feature reaction shots from people around the world? It makes a refreshing change that the 'invader' is not really part of an invasion force; he is just there to warn the world that more powerful planets see Earth's development of rockets and nuclear weapons as a threat that will be eliminated if necessary. The film nicely captures the paranoia of the cold war as almost everybody fears Klaatu. Klaatu himself provides the voice of reason as he tries to persuade people of the importance of his message; some people listen of course but not those that matter and his demonstration of power just makes the authorities more determined to kill him. If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must see; obviously some aspects are slightly dated but it is far less dated than one might expect from as sixty year old black and white film; I'm sure that sixty years from now people will be watching this not the recent remake.

    "There must be security for all or no one is secure."- Klaatu, to the world's leaders at the conclusion of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Here is the ne plus ultra for sci-fi movies. It does not pander to the child in us like E.T. It does not befuddle with dazzling images like 2001. Though it does present a threat from outer space, it does not take the form of a drooling, acid-for-blood whatsis with razor fangs and a hunger for human flesh. Instead, it proposes that there are indeed humanoid lifeforms in existence off the Earth with, dare I write it, powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (though Klaatu can't fly and is in no way bulletproof). THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North's fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man's capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie's urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto..... (And please don't waste your time with the utter failure that is the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake; just revel in the enduring excellence of the original).

    Welcome to Earth (Smack!), now go home! About 15 minutes into this movie, that's what I wanted to see some Earthling say(and do) to the alien Klaatu, who, after only a couple hours on Earth, was throwing his weight around and acting like he owned the place. Of course, "Welcome to Earth!" was the line famously uttered by Will Smith in "Independence Day" as he's punching an invading alien in the head, but I guess Earthlings had more spunk and defiance in the 1990's than in the early 1950's when this movie was set. Klaatu, at this point, is demanding (among other things) an audience with all the world's leaders, indifferent, apparently, to whether we could or even wanted to do such a thing. At this point he was talking to some diplomat type, who should have shown some backbone and said something like: "Who the hell crowned you Emperor of the Universe? You show up on our planet, unannounced and uninvited, giving no indication whether you were hostile or friendly, pull out a device without telling us what it is, making an already nervous bunch of soldiers even more nervous, one of them shoots it, slightly injuring you in the process, we apologize profusely and take you into one of our hospitals, and then you start telling us what YOU want US to do!" Or he could just skip most of that and say "Welcome to Earth (smack!), now go home!" At this point Klaatu had merely been pushy, overbearing, and a bit condescending, but things soon got much worse. About halfway through the film he is meeting with a scientist. At first they just talk science stuff, specifically how to solve an equation the professor was working on. But he soon gets to the meat of the matter. They don't like that we have nuclear weapons and are working on rockets. Their fear is we will soon use them on other planets, never mind no one on Earth has suggested any such thing. So, to defend against this (nonexistent) threat, they have robots that can kill everything on the planet, humans, animals, everything. At which point the scientist is in awe that such technology exists, apparently missing entirely the moral (or, more accurately, utterly immoral) nature of such a proposition. The scientist, like the diplomat, is apparently a wimp and lacks the guts to stand up to this spacegoing threatener of global genocide. What are we to think of a form of "Justice" administered by planet smashing robots who apparently cannot or will not distinguish between guilty and innocent, who will engage in mass murder on a scale unimagined even by a Hitler or Stalin, and all out of fear of a species which, according to Klaatu and his kind, are way behind them in terms of technology? Indeed, if Klaatu really wanted peace with Earth, he could have gone about it the civilized way. Announced in advance via radio communication that he was coming so we would have been prepared, requested permission before landing, and then asked (not demanded) that we sign a peace treaty with them. That's the civilized method of handling such matters, showing respect for the people he was dealing with, as opposed to the heavy handed approach he used in the movie. Ironically, although this movie is clearly intended to have a message, the true message may be the opposite of what the filmmakers intended. Namely, that totalitarianism done in the name of "Idealism" may in fact be worse than totalitarianism served straight up. Klaatu is presented as an idealist, a man (or alien) of peace, but in reality his morality is that of a thug, the classic bully's line of "Do as I say, or I'll bash your face in!" Give me the aliens of "Independence Day" over Klaatu and his ilk any time. They, too, threaten to wipe us out, but at least they're not claiming to do it in the name of "Peace". Anyway, so much for that. Putting aside the rather disturbing moral and philosophical issues raised by this movie, how does it rate purely as entertainment? On that scale, pretty good. The story itself is simple and well told, the acting generally solid. Patricia Neal is the only real star in this movie, and it shows, since her acting is on a level well above the rest. The filmmakers seemed to recognize the low level of special effects available at the time, so, for example, they simply have KLaatu played by a human actor with no attempts to make him look "Alien", not even such gimmicks as Spock style pointy ears.

It's one of the most thoughtful fantasy films ever made, although not perfect. The "speeded-up" film in the panic scenes looks very fake. The Army is portrayed as brainless and heartless. Poor Gort had wardrobe issues: You can see his air holes and zipper. Even the support "wires" as he carries Patricia back to the spaceship. The Earth doesn't really "stand still". The aliens just neutralize most electricity. That's not very scary, or is it? The movie's "message" is still relevant after 60 years. The people of Earth must learn to live in peace or someday we will all be blasted off the Earth. Whether we will kill ourselves off or are vaporized by alien robots like "Gort" still remains to be seen. A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.

    I can see why critics are giving this one a lot of positive reviews. It's a sci-fi film with substance and way ahead of it's time. It has elements of humanity and what we take for granted. Even in today's society people are just mad about the world and after each others throats. Even if this movie was made in the 50's the nature of human beings didn't change one bit but gotten worse. I can tell why this movie stands out even today and how it was such a unique movie when it first came out. It doesn't have that generic monstrous looking aliens with ray guns or that super friendly alien thing going on. In fact the alien that comes from outer space is the most human like alien I have ever seen. I am not saying this is a positive or negative aspect to the alien genre. But the only difference seems to be the fact that the alien Klaatu has more knowledge and better technology. I thought this movie would have been better though if it showed Klaatue getting to have more of a bonding and relationship with the human race. He does to a degree but not that much with just the scene of him hanging out in Washington D.C. with a boy. Now to be honest I didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining but it does have substance and a message. And I thought the ending was great. It's one of those endings where the message is clear but leaves it up to the audiences. 7/10

    Being a science fiction lover, I forced myself to see this movie. Fact remains that in our time, such movie can not carry our imagination away anymore... but it's interesting to think that in those years (1950's) it probably did! When seeing it now, I get bored and often thought "clichee", but the reason for that is that this was probably a trend setting movie for many SF stories later on. Also, I was wondering the link between how "the world/society/politics" would act in the real world vs in the movie; and how that has changed over time. IN the movie I often got irritated by thinking "damn, how stupid can they (the world) be to act in such foolish way (shooting an a friendly and innocent alien), it seems so logic that that is not the right thing to do now, but back then... it was maybe different (that's just one example). Anyway. I gave it a 7. It's always hard to judge an old movie. If today was 1955, then I would maybe have given it a 10?

    Science Fiction explores endless possibilities, in particular the future and advancement of mankind. During the 50s however, the genre was not given the credit it deserves. Works of cinematic science fiction lumped into the B-movie class and no one ever expected much of them. Back then, people had yet to realize the genre's full potential, which would later become evident in Star Trek and Star Wars. It wasn't until Robert Wise, indisputably one of films most accomplished directors made The Day the Earth Stood Still and delivered an approach like no other in science fiction that the genre achieved a whole new level of appreciation. As an avid fan of science fiction, I have been familiar with this movie for a long time, but I never understood just how impactful and revolutionary it was until now. In the movie, humanity was at the dawn of a new age. With the discovery of nuclear power, it was thought that mankind would soon be ready to explore the depths of outer space and discover that we are not alone in the universe. But the human race, given its fallible and conflicting nature, was not yet ready to take the next step without risking the annihilation of the human race. It falls to the humanoid extra-terrestrial being Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to warn the leaders of the planet Earth of the dangerous path they were on. Realizing that the leaders are unwilling to cooperate, Klaatu is forced to go into hiding. He takes refuge in a boarding house under the alias "Mr. Carpenter" and lives among a family that personifies the goodness of human nature. He realizes that someday soon, humans may be ready for the great beyond. Some of the effects, although crude by today's standards, are very appealing, but Robert Wise's film is not about how spectacular special effects can be, nor does it adhere to the conventional formula of human heroes triumphing over villainous aliens. The brilliance is in the many themes that Wise develops in a world at a time of warfare and fear. One of my favorite moments involves Klaatu and the young Bobby (Billy Gray) as Klaatu and the rest of the viewers are given a glimpse of 50s lifestyle. Klaatu perfectly captures the essence of being a stranger in a strange land as alien to the human world as humans are to his own. Klaatu sees the world through the perspective of Bobby. Looking through the eyes of an innocent child is often the best way to view life. Backed up by a strong script and adrenaline pumping tension, the theme of human goodness and the need to emphasize the better side of human nature is expressed beautifully with Robert Wise's unique blend of irresistible charm and drama features. Robert Wise boldly went where no filmmaker had gone before with The Day the Earth Stood Still, giving us a science fiction movie that made people question the nature of mankind and the direction we are heading. In the post war/cold war era, a time of desperation and terror, Wise ushered a ray of hope and delivered a small glimpse of Sci-fi potential that future generations would build on. People would never look at the genre the same way again and for that Mr. Wise has my everlasting gratitude.

    When a spaceship lands in Washington DC it is surrounded by an army fearing it may be dangerous. After a couple of hours it opens and a man in a strange space suit emerges; as he approaches the soldiers with his hand outstretched a solder thinks he is preparing to fire a weapon so shoots him. After this a giant robot comes out and fires a beam that destroys the weapons aimed at it. The man, named Klaatu, is taken to hospital and after he is treated he says he must talk to all world leaders to deliver a message; the problem is the world it too divided for leaders to agree to such a demand. Klaatu is told he must stay in the hospital but he escapes creating a panic as everybody wonders where the dangerous spaceman has gone he has taken up residence with a local family where he rents a room under the name of Carpenter. He makes friends with the young boy of the family and from him learns the identity of the leading scientist so pays him a visit. He agrees to arrange a meeting of world scientists but by now people are starting to get suspicious of him and, as he warns, if he dies the robot could destroy everything on Earth. This film is rightfully considered a classic; many things we see here would be repeated in films for decades to come what alien invasion film these days doesn't feature reaction shots from people around the world? It makes a refreshing change that the 'invader' is not really part of an invasion force; he is just there to warn the world that more powerful planets see Earth's development of rockets and nuclear weapons as a threat that will be eliminated if necessary. The film nicely captures the paranoia of the cold war as almost everybody fears Klaatu. Klaatu himself provides the voice of reason as he tries to persuade people of the importance of his message; some people listen of course but not those that matter and his demonstration of power just makes the authorities more determined to kill him. If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must see; obviously some aspects are slightly dated but it is far less dated than one might expect from as sixty year old black and white film; I'm sure that sixty years from now people will be watching this not the recent remake.

    "There must be security for all or no one is secure."- Klaatu, to the world's leaders at the conclusion of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Here is the ne plus ultra for sci-fi movies. It does not pander to the child in us like E.T. It does not befuddle with dazzling images like 2001. Though it does present a threat from outer space, it does not take the form of a drooling, acid-for-blood whatsis with razor fangs and a hunger for human flesh. Instead, it proposes that there are indeed humanoid lifeforms in existence off the Earth with, dare I write it, powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (though Klaatu can't fly and is in no way bulletproof). THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North's fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man's capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie's urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto..... (And please don't waste your time with the utter failure that is the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake; just revel in the enduring excellence of the original).

    Welcome to Earth (Smack!), now go home! About 15 minutes into this movie, that's what I wanted to see some Earthling say(and do) to the alien Klaatu, who, after only a couple hours on Earth, was throwing his weight around and acting like he owned the place. Of course, "Welcome to Earth!" was the line famously uttered by Will Smith in "Independence Day" as he's punching an invading alien in the head, but I guess Earthlings had more spunk and defiance in the 1990's than in the early 1950's when this movie was set. Klaatu, at this point, is demanding (among other things) an audience with all the world's leaders, indifferent, apparently, to whether we could or even wanted to do such a thing. At this point he was talking to some diplomat type, who should have shown some backbone and said something like: "Who the hell crowned you Emperor of the Universe? You show up on our planet, unannounced and uninvited, giving no indication whether you were hostile or friendly, pull out a device without telling us what it is, making an already nervous bunch of soldiers even more nervous, one of them shoots it, slightly injuring you in the process, we apologize profusely and take you into one of our hospitals, and then you start telling us what YOU want US to do!" Or he could just skip most of that and say "Welcome to Earth (smack!), now go home!" At this point Klaatu had merely been pushy, overbearing, and a bit condescending, but things soon got much worse. About halfway through the film he is meeting with a scientist. At first they just talk science stuff, specifically how to solve an equation the professor was working on. But he soon gets to the meat of the matter. They don't like that we have nuclear weapons and are working on rockets. Their fear is we will soon use them on other planets, never mind no one on Earth has suggested any such thing. So, to defend against this (nonexistent) threat, they have robots that can kill everything on the planet, humans, animals, everything. At which point the scientist is in awe that such technology exists, apparently missing entirely the moral (or, more accurately, utterly immoral) nature of such a proposition. The scientist, like the diplomat, is apparently a wimp and lacks the guts to stand up to this spacegoing threatener of global genocide. What are we to think of a form of "Justice" administered by planet smashing robots who apparently cannot or will not distinguish between guilty and innocent, who will engage in mass murder on a scale unimagined even by a Hitler or Stalin, and all out of fear of a species which, according to Klaatu and his kind, are way behind them in terms of technology? Indeed, if Klaatu really wanted peace with Earth, he could have gone about it the civilized way. Announced in advance via radio communication that he was coming so we would have been prepared, requested permission before landing, and then asked (not demanded) that we sign a peace treaty with them. That's the civilized method of handling such matters, showing respect for the people he was dealing with, as opposed to the heavy handed approach he used in the movie. Ironically, although this movie is clearly intended to have a message, the true message may be the opposite of what the filmmakers intended. Namely, that totalitarianism done in the name of "Idealism" may in fact be worse than totalitarianism served straight up. Klaatu is presented as an idealist, a man (or alien) of peace, but in reality his morality is that of a thug, the classic bully's line of "Do as I say, or I'll bash your face in!" Give me the aliens of "Independence Day" over Klaatu and his ilk any time. They, too, threaten to wipe us out, but at least they're not claiming to do it in the name of "Peace". Anyway, so much for that. Putting aside the rather disturbing moral and philosophical issues raised by this movie, how does it rate purely as entertainment? On that scale, pretty good. The story itself is simple and well told, the acting generally solid. Patricia Neal is the only real star in this movie, and it shows, since her acting is on a level well above the rest. The filmmakers seemed to recognize the low level of special effects available at the time, so, for example, they simply have KLaatu played by a human actor with no attempts to make him look "Alien", not even such gimmicks as Spock style pointy ears. The ship is your basic flying saucer, no attempt is made to explain its propulsion system nor other forms of alien technology. This was the early 1950's and the science fiction movie genre was in its infancy. Later movies, like the Star Wars, Terminator, Alien, and Matrix series would be far more sophisticated, but then they had earlier movies such as this one to learn from. 5/10

    While I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, I watched this classic for the first time last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it! Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu, a tall, dignified alien who travels 250 million miles from an unnamed planet to Washington, D.C. He is accompanied by Gort (Lock Martin), a gigantic robot that can destroy weapons with a powerful laser beam. Klaatu takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray). (Incidentally, Gray would later play Bud Anderson in the hit TV series "Father Knows Best".) In summary, Klaatu warns the people on earth that they must either pursue peace or face obliteration. For me, everything about this movie meshes very well - the intelligent plot, the superb cast, the eerie soundtrack, and the modest special effects. Trivia fans will note the obvious parallels between Klaatu and Jesus, e.g. Mr. Carpenter is Klaatu's alias, he prophesies destruction on earth, he dies and later comes back to life. The only thing I wish the screenwriters had changed would be to include Bobby in the final scene - especially considering that he and Klaatu become good friends during the alien's stay in Washington. Other than that, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a sci-fi masterpiece that just gets better with age! Yes, technology has changed, but the film's message remains highly relevant to this day.

    This movie is good, but not great. The movie's theme is obvious - war is bad, peace is good, and the human race better listen up, or else. Michael Rennie plays the principal role with dignity, which prevents the movie from becoming a spoof. Hugh Marlowe plays what is perhaps the most realistic character in the story and whose character reveals the kind of character flaws which have brought the human race to the brink of destruction. The special effects are surprisingly good. What is not that good is the contrived nature of the story with its obvious political spin. Also, the response to the alien's arrival is surprisingly understated. True, the alien is shot, twice, but given his unexpected arrival and the weapon he brought, a robot that could destroy the earth, such a response is not implausible. That is, the humans have cause to feel alarmed which this movie seems to suggest is an overreaction. The alien's unveiled threat of destruction should have been enough to send this alien packing. Any message delivered at the point of gun, so to speak, is a message that is not worth its weight in words. Now, the movie is well made - the story is straight forward and the acting is strong. This movie had great value as a cinematic antique.

    "Klaatu barada nikto!" When it comes to the Sci-Fi sub-genre of "Alien Visitation" flicks, I honestly don't think that they get much more intelligent and thought-provoking as this sparkling gem from 1951. If there are other such "Alien Visitation" flicks out there that do promote this satisfying level of genuine intelligence in their stories, then I would sure like to hear about them. (Please feel free to message me with their titles) Impressively directed by Robert Wise, The Day The Earth Stood Still (TDTESS) actually did manage to deliver quite a seamless and evocative blend of the ordinary melded very nicely with the fantastic. This is the sort of motion picture that really gives the viewer the pleasant opportunity of actually getting to know (and, maybe, even like) its characters. Even the 10 year-old kid, Bobby Benson, was a likable sort. And, believe me, I usually loathe kids in movies. They almost never fail to be totally irksome and nothing but spoiled, little, snot-nosed brats. Yet, here in TDTESS, the young Billy Gray's portrayal of Bobby was very much like a literal breath of fresh air. This youthful, wide-eyed actor really seemed to understand his character and make him interesting. Anyways - Traveling at warp-speed (that's 4000 mph.) and taking a 5-month, 250 million mile journey to get here, TDTESS's story has Klaatu, the very distinguished and cool-headed alien, arriving in Washington, DC in order to deliver his dire, top-priority message to all of us naughty-naughty Earthlings. After being observed for many years by other outer-planetary civilizations, it has been determined that (through the discovery of atomic power) we Earthlings, with our unbridled destructiveness, have become a very-very serious threat to the overall peace and security of the other planets which exist in this endlessly vast universe. Klaatu must now address all nations of the Earth and somehow convince one and all to cease with these violent ways, or else face some mighty devastating consequences. You can bet that if Klaatu's firm words of warning can't induce us Earthlings to reconsider our ways, then, believe me, Gort, the all-powerful robot, definitely has his own special brand of persuasion that doesn't take "No" for an answer. Trust me - In spite of its flaws, TDTESS is, without question, a classic Sci-Fi/Thriller that's really worth its weight in gold. And "Klaatu barada nikto!" to you, too! P.S. - This film's 2008 remake was an absolutely despicable desecration of the highest order.

    I first saw this on NBC's "Saturday Night at the Movies". I never saw it on a big screen. The robot, "Gort" was not as scary on a 21" TV set, but when his "laser eye" opened it gave me chills and it still does. Remarkably simple special effects by today's standards yet highly effective. That "creepy" classic music. Gaunt and tall (6'4") Michael Rennie looks like an alien. Sam Jaffe is the perfect "Einstein-like" eccentric scientist. Patricia Neal, Billy Gray and Hugh Marlowe are credible as the supporting cast in the most unusual sci-fi film ever made. The studio "sold" it as a "monster" movie, which it never was. The robot carries a blond-haired bimbo (in a sultry red dress) in its arms on the lobby cards. Patricia was not blond and did not wear a "red" dress, though it's hard to tell in a b/w movie. It's one of the most thoughtful fantasy films ever made, although not perfect. The "speeded-up" film in the panic scenes looks very fake. The Army is portrayed as brainless and heartless. Poor Gort had wardrobe issues: You can see his air holes and zipper. Even the support "wires" as he carries Patricia back to the spaceship. The Earth doesn't really "stand still". The aliens just neutralize most electricity. That's not very scary, or is it? The movie's "message" is still relevant after 60 years. The people of Earth must learn to live in peace or someday we will all be blasted off the Earth. Whether we will kill ourselves off or are vaporized by alien robots like "Gort" still remains to be seen. A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.

Klaatu is told he must stay in the hospital but he escapes creating a panic as everybody wonders where the dangerous spaceman has gone he has taken up residence with a local family where he rents a room under the name of Carpenter. He makes friends with the young boy of the family and from him learns the identity of the leading scientist so pays him a visit. He agrees to arrange a meeting of world scientists but by now people are starting to get suspicious of him and, as he warns, if he dies the robot could destroy everything on Earth. This film is rightfully considered a classic; many things we see here would be repeated in films for decades to come what alien invasion film these days doesn't feature reaction shots from people around the world? It makes a refreshing change that the 'invader' is not really part of an invasion force; he is just there to warn the world that more powerful planets see Earth's development of rockets and nuclear weapons as a threat that will be eliminated if necessary. The film nicely captures the paranoia of the cold war as almost everybody fears Klaatu. Klaatu himself provides the voice of reason as he tries to persuade people of the importance of his message; some people listen of course but not those that matter and his demonstration of power just makes the authorities more determined to kill him. If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must see; obviously some aspects are slightly dated but it is far less dated than one might expect from as sixty year old black and white film; I'm sure that sixty years from now people will be watching this not the recent remake.

    "There must be security for all or no one is secure."- Klaatu, to the world's leaders at the conclusion of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Here is the ne plus ultra for sci-fi movies. It does not pander to the child in us like E.T. It does not befuddle with dazzling images like 2001. Though it does present a threat from outer space, it does not take the form of a drooling, acid-for-blood whatsis with razor fangs and a hunger for human flesh. Instead, it proposes that there are indeed humanoid lifeforms in existence off the Earth with, dare I write it, powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (though Klaatu can't fly and is in no way bulletproof). THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North's fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man's capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie's urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto..... (And please don't waste your time with the utter failure that is the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake; just revel in the enduring excellence of the original).

    Welcome to Earth (Smack!), now go home! About 15 minutes into this movie, that's what I wanted to see some Earthling say(and do) to the alien Klaatu, who, after only a couple hours on Earth, was throwing his weight around and acting like he owned the place. Of course, "Welcome to Earth!" was the line famously uttered by Will Smith in "Independence Day" as he's punching an invading alien in the head, but I guess Earthlings had more spunk and defiance in the 1990's than in the early 1950's when this movie was set. Klaatu, at this point, is demanding (among other things) an audience with all the world's leaders, indifferent, apparently, to whether we could or even wanted to do such a thing. At this point he was talking to some diplomat type, who should have shown some backbone and said something like: "Who the hell crowned you Emperor of the Universe? You show up on our planet, unannounced and uninvited, giving no indication whether you were hostile or friendly, pull out a device without telling us what it is, making an already nervous bunch of soldiers even more nervous, one of them shoots it, slightly injuring you in the process, we apologize profusely and take you into one of our hospitals, and then you start telling us what YOU want US to do!" Or he could just skip most of that and say "Welcome to Earth (smack!), now go home!" At this point Klaatu had merely been pushy, overbearing, and a bit condescending, but things soon got much worse. About halfway through the film he is meeting with a scientist. At first they just talk science stuff, specifically how to solve an equation the professor was working on. But he soon gets to the meat of the matter. They don't like that we have nuclear weapons and are working on rockets. Their fear is we will soon use them on other planets, never mind no one on Earth has suggested any such thing. So, to defend against this (nonexistent) threat, they have robots that can kill everything on the planet, humans, animals, everything. At which point the scientist is in awe that such technology exists, apparently missing entirely the moral (or, more accurately, utterly immoral) nature of such a proposition. The scientist, like the diplomat, is apparently a wimp and lacks the guts to stand up to this spacegoing threatener of global genocide. What are we to think of a form of "Justice" administered by planet smashing robots who apparently cannot or will not distinguish between guilty and innocent, who will engage in mass murder on a scale unimagined even by a Hitler or Stalin, and all out of fear of a species which, according to Klaatu and his kind, are way behind them in terms of technology? Indeed, if Klaatu really wanted peace with Earth, he could have gone about it the civilized way. Announced in advance via radio communication that he was coming so we would have been prepared, requested permission before landing, and then asked (not demanded) that we sign a peace treaty with them. That's the civilized method of handling such matters, showing respect for the people he was dealing with, as opposed to the heavy handed approach he used in the movie. Ironically, although this movie is clearly intended to have a message, the true message may be the opposite of what the filmmakers intended. Namely, that totalitarianism done in the name of "Idealism" may in fact be worse than totalitarianism served straight up. Klaatu is presented as an idealist, a man (or alien) of peace, but in reality his morality is that of a thug, the classic bully's line of "Do as I say, or I'll bash your face in!" Give me the aliens of "Independence Day" over Klaatu and his ilk any time. They, too, threaten to wipe us out, but at least they're not claiming to do it in the name of "Peace". Anyway, so much for that. Putting aside the rather disturbing moral and philosophical issues raised by this movie, how does it rate purely as entertainment? On that scale, pretty good. The story itself is simple and well told, the acting generally solid. Patricia Neal is the only real star in this movie, and it shows, since her acting is on a level well above the rest. The filmmakers seemed to recognize the low level of special effects available at the time, so, for example, they simply have KLaatu played by a human actor with no attempts to make him look "Alien", not even such gimmicks as Spock style pointy ears. The ship is your basic flying saucer, no attempt is made to explain its propulsion system nor other forms of alien technology. This was the early 1950's and the science fiction movie genre was in its infancy. Later movies, like the Star Wars, Terminator, Alien, and Matrix series would be far more sophisticated, but then they had earlier movies such as this one to learn from. 5/10

    While I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, I watched this classic for the first time last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it! Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu, a tall, dignified alien who travels 250 million miles from an unnamed planet to Washington, D.C. He is accompanied by Gort (Lock Martin), a gigantic robot that can destroy weapons with a powerful laser beam. Klaatu takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray). (Incidentally, Gray would later play Bud Anderson in the hit TV series "Father Knows Best".) In summary, Klaatu warns the people on earth that they must either pursue peace or face obliteration. For me, everything about this movie meshes very well - the intelligent plot, the superb cast, the eerie soundtrack, and the modest special effects. Trivia fans will note the obvious parallels between Klaatu and Jesus, e.g. Mr. Carpenter is Klaatu's alias, he prophesies destruction on earth, he dies and later comes back to life. The only thing I wish the screenwriters had changed would be to include Bobby in the final scene - especially considering that he and Klaatu become good friends during the alien's stay in Washington. Other than that, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a sci-fi masterpiece that just gets better with age! Yes, technology has changed, but the film's message remains highly relevant to this day.

    This movie is good, but not great. The movie's theme is obvious - war is bad, peace is good, and the human race better listen up, or else. Michael Rennie plays the principal role with dignity, which prevents the movie from becoming a spoof. Hugh Marlowe plays what is perhaps the most realistic character in the story and whose character reveals the kind of character flaws which have brought the human race to the brink of destruction. The special effects are surprisingly good. What is not that good is the contrived nature of the story with its obvious political spin. Also, the response to the alien's arrival is surprisingly understated. True, the alien is shot, twice, but given his unexpected arrival and the weapon he brought, a robot that could destroy the earth, such a response is not implausible. That is, the humans have cause to feel alarmed which this movie seems to suggest is an overreaction. The alien's unveiled threat of destruction should have been enough to send this alien packing. Any message delivered at the point of gun, so to speak, is a message that is not worth its weight in words. Now, the movie is well made - the story is straight forward and the acting is strong. This movie had great value as a cinematic antique.

    "Klaatu barada nikto!" When it comes to the Sci-Fi sub-genre of "Alien Visitation" flicks, I honestly don't think that they get much more intelligent and thought-provoking as this sparkling gem from 1951. If there are other such "Alien Visitation" flicks out there that do promote this satisfying level of genuine intelligence in their stories, then I would sure like to hear about them. (Please feel free to message me with their titles) Impressively directed by Robert Wise, The Day The Earth Stood Still (TDTESS) actually did manage to deliver quite a seamless and evocative blend of the ordinary melded very nicely with the fantastic. This is the sort of motion picture that really gives the viewer the pleasant opportunity of actually getting to know (and, maybe, even like) its characters. Even the 10 year-old kid, Bobby Benson, was a likable sort. And, believe me, I usually loathe kids in movies. They almost never fail to be totally irksome and nothing but spoiled, little, snot-nosed brats. Yet, here in TDTESS, the young Billy Gray's portrayal of Bobby was very much like a literal breath of fresh air. This youthful, wide-eyed actor really seemed to understand his character and make him interesting. Anyways - Traveling at warp-speed (that's 4000 mph.) and taking a 5-month, 250 million mile journey to get here, TDTESS's story has Klaatu, the very distinguished and cool-headed alien, arriving in Washington, DC in order to deliver his dire, top-priority message to all of us naughty-naughty Earthlings. After being observed for many years by other outer-planetary civilizations, it has been determined that (through the discovery of atomic power) we Earthlings, with our unbridled destructiveness, have become a very-very serious threat to the overall peace and security of the other planets which exist in this endlessly vast universe. Klaatu must now address all nations of the Earth and somehow convince one and all to cease with these violent ways, or else face some mighty devastating consequences. You can bet that if Klaatu's firm words of warning can't induce us Earthlings to reconsider our ways, then, believe me, Gort, the all-powerful robot, definitely has his own special brand of persuasion that doesn't take "No" for an answer. Trust me - In spite of its flaws, TDTESS is, without question, a classic Sci-Fi/Thriller that's really worth its weight in gold. And "Klaatu barada nikto!" to you, too! P.S. - This film's 2008 remake was an absolutely despicable desecration of the highest order.

    I first saw this on NBC's "Saturday Night at the Movies". I never saw it on a big screen. The robot, "Gort" was not as scary on a 21" TV set, but when his "laser eye" opened it gave me chills and it still does. Remarkably simple special effects by today's standards yet highly effective. That "creepy" classic music. Gaunt and tall (6'4") Michael Rennie looks like an alien. Sam Jaffe is the perfect "Einstein-like" eccentric scientist. Patricia Neal, Billy Gray and Hugh Marlowe are credible as the supporting cast in the most unusual sci-fi film ever made. The studio "sold" it as a "monster" movie, which it never was. The robot carries a blond-haired bimbo (in a sultry red dress) in its arms on the lobby cards. Patricia was not blond and did not wear a "red" dress, though it's hard to tell in a b/w movie. It's one of the most thoughtful fantasy films ever made, although not perfect. The "speeded-up" film in the panic scenes looks very fake. The Army is portrayed as brainless and heartless. Poor Gort had wardrobe issues: You can see his air holes and zipper. Even the support "wires" as he carries Patricia back to the spaceship. The Earth doesn't really "stand still". The aliens just neutralize most electricity. That's not very scary, or is it? The movie's "message" is still relevant after 60 years. The people of Earth must learn to live in peace or someday we will all be blasted off the Earth. Whether we will kill ourselves off or are vaporized by alien robots like "Gort" still remains to be seen. A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.

    I can see why critics are giving this one a lot of positive reviews. It's a sci-fi film with substance and way ahead of it's time. It has elements of humanity and what we take for granted. Even in today's society people are just mad about the world and after each others throats. Even if this movie was made in the 50's the nature of human beings didn't change one bit but gotten worse. I can tell why this movie stands out even today and how it was such a unique movie when it first came out. It doesn't have that generic monstrous looking aliens with ray guns or that super friendly alien thing going on. In fact the alien that comes from outer space is the most human like alien I have ever seen. I am not saying this is a positive or negative aspect to the alien genre. But the only difference seems to be the fact that the alien Klaatu has more knowledge and better technology. I thought this movie would have been better though if it showed Klaatue getting to have more of a bonding and relationship with the human race. He does to a degree but not that much with just the scene of him hanging out in Washington D.C. with a boy. Now to be honest I didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining but it does have substance and a message. And I thought the ending was great. It's one of those endings where the message is clear but leaves it up to the audiences. 7/10

    Being a science fiction lover, I forced myself to see this movie. Fact remains that in our time, such movie can not carry our imagination away anymore... but it's interesting to think that in those years (1950's) it probably did! When seeing it now, I get bored and often thought "clichee", but the reason for that is that this was probably a trend setting movie for many SF stories later on. Also, I was wondering the link between how "the world/society/politics" would act in the real world vs in the movie; and how that has changed over time. IN the movie I often got irritated by thinking "damn, how stupid can they (the world) be to act in such foolish way (shooting an a friendly and innocent alien), it seems so logic that that is not the right thing to do now, but back then... it was maybe different (that's just one example). Anyway. I gave it a 7. It's always hard to judge an old movie. If today was 1955, then I would maybe have given it a 10?

    Science Fiction explores endless possibilities, in particular the future and advancement of mankind. During the 50s however, the genre was not given the credit it deserves. Works of cinematic science fiction lumped into the B-movie class and no one ever expected much of them. Back then, people had yet to realize the genre's full potential, which would later become evident in Star Trek and Star Wars. It wasn't until Robert Wise, indisputably one of films most accomplished directors made The Day the Earth Stood Still and delivered an approach like no other in science fiction that the genre achieved a whole new level of appreciation. As an avid fan of science fiction, I have been familiar with this movie for a long time, but I never understood just how impactful and revolutionary it was until now. In the movie, humanity was at the dawn of a new age. With the discovery of nuclear power, it was thought that mankind would soon be ready to explore the depths of outer space and discover that we are not alone in the universe. But the human race, given its fallible and conflicting nature, was not yet ready to take the next step without risking the annihilation of the human race. It falls to the humanoid extra-terrestrial being Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to warn the leaders of the planet Earth of the dangerous path they were on. Realizing that the leaders are unwilling to cooperate, Klaatu is forced to go into hiding. He takes refuge in a boarding house under the alias "Mr. Carpenter" and lives among a family that personifies the goodness of human nature. He realizes that someday soon, humans may be ready for the great beyond. Some of the effects, although crude by today's standards, are very appealing, but Robert Wise's film is not about how spectacular special effects can be, nor does it adhere to the conventional formula of human heroes triumphing over villainous aliens. The brilliance is in the many themes that Wise develops in a world at a time of warfare and fear. One of my favorite moments involves Klaatu and the young Bobby (Billy Gray) as Klaatu and the rest of the viewers are given a glimpse of 50s lifestyle. Klaatu perfectly captures the essence of being a stranger in a strange land as alien to the human world as humans are to his own. Klaatu sees the world through the perspective of Bobby. Looking through the eyes of an innocent child is often the best way to view life. Backed up by a strong script and adrenaline pumping tension, the theme of human goodness and the need to emphasize the better side of human nature is expressed beautifully with Robert Wise's unique blend of irresistible charm and drama features. Robert Wise boldly went where no filmmaker had gone before with The Day the Earth Stood Still, giving us a science fiction movie that made people question the nature of mankind and the direction we are heading. In the post war/cold war era, a time of desperation and terror, Wise ushered a ray of hope and delivered a small glimpse of Sci-fi potential that future generations would build on. People would never look at the genre the same way again and for that Mr. Wise has my everlasting gratitude.

    When a spaceship lands in Washington DC it is surrounded by an army fearing it may be dangerous. After a couple of hours it opens and a man in a strange space suit emerges; as he approaches the soldiers with his hand outstretched a solder thinks he is preparing to fire a weapon so shoots him. After this a giant robot comes out and fires a beam that destroys the weapons aimed at it. The man, named Klaatu, is taken to hospital and after he is treated he says he must talk to all world leaders to deliver a message; the problem is the world it too divided for leaders to agree to such a demand. Klaatu is told he must stay in the hospital but he escapes creating a panic as everybody wonders where the dangerous spaceman has gone he has taken up residence with a local family where he rents a room under the name of Carpenter.

He agrees to arrange a meeting of world scientists but by now people are starting to get suspicious of him and, as he warns, if he dies the robot could destroy everything on Earth. This film is rightfully considered a classic; many things we see here would be repeated in films for decades to come what alien invasion film these days doesn't feature reaction shots from people around the world?

    Welcome to Earth (Smack!), now go home! About 15 minutes into this movie, that's what I wanted to see some Earthling say(and do) to the alien Klaatu, who, after only a couple hours on Earth, was throwing his weight around and acting like he owned the place.

Later movies, like the Star Wars, Terminator, Alien, and Matrix series would be far more sophisticated, but then they had earlier movies such as this one to learn from. 5/10

    While I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, I watched this classic for the first time last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it! Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu, a tall, dignified alien who travels 250 million miles from an unnamed planet to Washington, D.C. He is accompanied by Gort (Lock Martin), a gigantic robot that can destroy weapons with a powerful laser beam. Klaatu takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray). (Incidentally, Gray would later play Bud Anderson in the hit TV series "Father Knows Best".) In summary, Klaatu warns the people on earth that they must either pursue peace or face obliteration. For me, everything about this movie meshes very well - the intelligent plot, the superb cast, the eerie soundtrack, and the modest special effects. Trivia fans will note the obvious parallels between Klaatu and Jesus, e.g. Mr. Carpenter is Klaatu's alias, he prophesies destruction on earth, he dies and later comes back to life. The only thing I wish the screenwriters had changed would be to include Bobby in the final scene - especially considering that he and Klaatu become good friends during the alien's stay in Washington. Other than that, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a sci-fi masterpiece that just gets better with age! Yes, technology has changed, but the film's message remains highly relevant to this day.

    This movie is good, but not great. The movie's theme is obvious - war is bad, peace is good, and the human race better listen up, or else. Michael Rennie plays the principal role with dignity, which prevents the movie from becoming a spoof. Hugh Marlowe plays what is perhaps the most realistic character in the story and whose character reveals the kind of character flaws which have brought the human race to the brink of destruction. The special effects are surprisingly good. What is not that good is the contrived nature of the story with its obvious political spin. Also, the response to the alien's arrival is surprisingly understated. True, the alien is shot, twice, but given his unexpected arrival and the weapon he brought, a robot that could destroy the earth, such a response is not implausible. That is, the humans have cause to feel alarmed which this movie seems to suggest is an overreaction. The alien's unveiled threat of destruction should have been enough to send this alien packing. Any message delivered at the point of gun, so to speak, is a message that is not worth its weight in words. Now, the movie is well made - the story is straight forward and the acting is strong. This movie had great value as a cinematic antique.

    "Klaatu barada nikto!" When it comes to the Sci-Fi sub-genre of "Alien Visitation" flicks, I honestly don't think that they get much more intelligent and thought-provoking as this sparkling gem from 1951. If there are other such "Alien Visitation" flicks out there that do promote this satisfying level of genuine intelligence in their stories, then I would sure like to hear about them. (Please feel free to message me with their titles) Impressively directed by Robert Wise, The Day The Earth Stood Still (TDTESS) actually did manage to deliver quite a seamless and evocative blend of the ordinary melded very nicely with the fantastic. This is the sort of motion picture that really gives the viewer the pleasant opportunity of actually getting to know (and, maybe, even like) its characters. Even the 10 year-old kid, Bobby Benson, was a likable sort. And, believe me, I usually loathe kids in movies. They almost never fail to be totally irksome and nothing but spoiled, little, snot-nosed brats. Yet, here in TDTESS, the young Billy Gray's portrayal of Bobby was very much like a literal breath of fresh air. This youthful, wide-eyed actor really seemed to understand his character and make him interesting. Anyways - Traveling at warp-speed (that's 4000 mph.) and taking a 5-month, 250 million mile journey to get here, TDTESS's story has Klaatu, the very distinguished and cool-headed alien, arriving in Washington, DC in order to deliver his dire, top-priority message to all of us naughty-naughty Earthlings. After being observed for many years by other outer-planetary civilizations, it has been determined that (through the discovery of atomic power) we Earthlings, with our unbridled destructiveness, have become a very-very serious threat to the overall peace and security of the other planets which exist in this endlessly vast universe. Klaatu must now address all nations of the Earth and somehow convince one and all to cease with these violent ways, or else face some mighty devastating consequences. You can bet that if Klaatu's firm words of warning can't induce us Earthlings to reconsider our ways, then, believe me, Gort, the all-powerful robot, definitely has his own special brand of persuasion that doesn't take "No" for an answer. Trust me - In spite of its flaws, TDTESS is, without question, a classic Sci-Fi/Thriller that's really worth its weight in gold. And "Klaatu barada nikto!" to you, too! P.S. - This film's 2008 remake was an absolutely despicable desecration of the highest order.

    I first saw this on NBC's "Saturday Night at the Movies". I never saw it on a big screen. The robot, "Gort" was not as scary on a 21" TV set, but when his "laser eye" opened it gave me chills and it still does. Remarkably simple special effects by today's standards yet highly effective. That "creepy" classic music. Gaunt and tall (6'4") Michael Rennie looks like an alien. Sam Jaffe is the perfect "Einstein-like" eccentric scientist. Patricia Neal, Billy Gray and Hugh Marlowe are credible as the supporting cast in the most unusual sci-fi film ever made. The studio "sold" it as a "monster" movie, which it never was. The robot carries a blond-haired bimbo (in a sultry red dress) in its arms on the lobby cards. Patricia was not blond and did not wear a "red" dress, though it's hard to tell in a b/w movie. It's one of the most thoughtful fantasy films ever made, although not perfect. The "speeded-up" film in the panic scenes looks very fake. The Army is portrayed as brainless and heartless. Poor Gort had wardrobe issues: You can see his air holes and zipper. Even the support "wires" as he carries Patricia back to the spaceship. The Earth doesn't really "stand still". The aliens just neutralize most electricity. That's not very scary, or is it? The movie's "message" is still relevant after 60 years. The people of Earth must learn to live in peace or someday we will all be blasted off the Earth. Whether we will kill ourselves off or are vaporized by alien robots like "Gort" still remains to be seen. A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.

    I can see why critics are giving this one a lot of positive reviews. It's a sci-fi film with substance and way ahead of it's time. It has elements of humanity and what we take for granted. Even in today's society people are just mad about the world and after each others throats. Even if this movie was made in the 50's the nature of human beings didn't change one bit but gotten worse. I can tell why this movie stands out even today and how it was such a unique movie when it first came out. It doesn't have that generic monstrous looking aliens with ray guns or that super friendly alien thing going on. In fact the alien that comes from outer space is the most human like alien I have ever seen. I am not saying this is a positive or negative aspect to the alien genre. But the only difference seems to be the fact that the alien Klaatu has more knowledge and better technology. I thought this movie would have been better though if it showed Klaatue getting to have more of a bonding and relationship with the human race. He does to a degree but not that much with just the scene of him hanging out in Washington D.C. with a boy. Now to be honest I didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining but it does have substance and a message. And I thought the ending was great. It's one of those endings where the message is clear but leaves it up to the audiences. 7/10

    Being a science fiction lover, I forced myself to see this movie. Fact remains that in our time, such movie can not carry our imagination away anymore... but it's interesting to think that in those years (1950's) it probably did! When seeing it now, I get bored and often thought "clichee", but the reason for that is that this was probably a trend setting movie for many SF stories later on. Also, I was wondering the link between how "the world/society/politics" would act in the real world vs in the movie; and how that has changed over time. IN the movie I often got irritated by thinking "damn, how stupid can they (the world) be to act in such foolish way (shooting an a friendly and innocent alien), it seems so logic that that is not the right thing to do now, but back then... it was maybe different (that's just one example). Anyway. I gave it a 7. It's always hard to judge an old movie. If today was 1955, then I would maybe have given it a 10?

    Science Fiction explores endless possibilities, in particular the future and advancement of mankind. During the 50s however, the genre was not given the credit it deserves. Works of cinematic science fiction lumped into the B-movie class and no one ever expected much of them. Back then, people had yet to realize the genre's full potential, which would later become evident in Star Trek and Star Wars. It wasn't until Robert Wise, indisputably one of films most accomplished directors made The Day the Earth Stood Still and delivered an approach like no other in science fiction that the genre achieved a whole new level of appreciation. As an avid fan of science fiction, I have been familiar with this movie for a long time, but I never understood just how impactful and revolutionary it was until now. In the movie, humanity was at the dawn of a new age. With the discovery of nuclear power, it was thought that mankind would soon be ready to explore the depths of outer space and discover that we are not alone in the universe. But the human race, given its fallible and conflicting nature, was not yet ready to take the next step without risking the annihilation of the human race. It falls to the humanoid extra-terrestrial being Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to warn the leaders of the planet Earth of the dangerous path they were on. Realizing that the leaders are unwilling to cooperate, Klaatu is forced to go into hiding. He takes refuge in a boarding house under the alias "Mr. Carpenter" and lives among a family that personifies the goodness of human nature. He realizes that someday soon, humans may be ready for the great beyond. Some of the effects, although crude by today's standards, are very appealing, but Robert Wise's film is not about how spectacular special effects can be, nor does it adhere to the conventional formula of human heroes triumphing over villainous aliens. The brilliance is in the many themes that Wise develops in a world at a time of warfare and fear. One of my favorite moments involves Klaatu and the young Bobby (Billy Gray) as Klaatu and the rest of the viewers are given a glimpse of 50s lifestyle. Klaatu perfectly captures the essence of being a stranger in a strange land as alien to the human world as humans are to his own. Klaatu sees the world through the perspective of Bobby. Looking through the eyes of an innocent child is often the best way to view life. Backed up by a strong script and adrenaline pumping tension, the theme of human goodness and the need to emphasize the better side of human nature is expressed beautifully with Robert Wise's unique blend of irresistible charm and drama features. Robert Wise boldly went where no filmmaker had gone before with The Day the Earth Stood Still, giving us a science fiction movie that made people question the nature of mankind and the direction we are heading. In the post war/cold war era, a time of desperation and terror, Wise ushered a ray of hope and delivered a small glimpse of Sci-fi potential that future generations would build on. People would never look at the genre the same way again and for that Mr. Wise has my everlasting gratitude.

    When a spaceship lands in Washington DC it is surrounded by an army fearing it may be dangerous. After a couple of hours it opens and a man in a strange space suit emerges; as he approaches the soldiers with his hand outstretched a solder thinks he is preparing to fire a weapon so shoots him. After this a giant robot comes out and fires a beam that destroys the weapons aimed at it. The man, named Klaatu, is taken to hospital and after he is treated he says he must talk to all world leaders to deliver a message; the problem is the world it too divided for leaders to agree to such a demand. Klaatu is told he must stay in the hospital but he escapes creating a panic as everybody wonders where the dangerous spaceman has gone he has taken up residence with a local family where he rents a room under the name of Carpenter. He makes friends with the young boy of the family and from him learns the identity of the leading scientist so pays him a visit. He agrees to arrange a meeting of world scientists but by now people are starting to get suspicious of him and, as he warns, if he dies the robot could destroy everything on Earth. This film is rightfully considered a classic; many things we see here would be repeated in films for decades to come what alien invasion film these days doesn't feature reaction shots from people around the world? It makes a refreshing change that the 'invader' is not really part of an invasion force; he is just there to warn the world that more powerful planets see Earth's development of rockets and nuclear weapons as a threat that will be eliminated if necessary. The film nicely captures the paranoia of the cold war as almost everybody fears Klaatu. Klaatu himself provides the voice of reason as he tries to persuade people of the importance of his message; some people listen of course but not those that matter and his demonstration of power just makes the authorities more determined to kill him. If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must see; obviously some aspects are slightly dated but it is far less dated than one might expect from as sixty year old black and white film; I'm sure that sixty years from now people will be watching this not the recent remake.

    "There must be security for all or no one is secure."- Klaatu, to the world's leaders at the conclusion of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Here is the ne plus ultra for sci-fi movies. It does not pander to the child in us like E.T. It does not befuddle with dazzling images like 2001. Though it does present a threat from outer space, it does not take the form of a drooling, acid-for-blood whatsis with razor fangs and a hunger for human flesh. Instead, it proposes that there are indeed humanoid lifeforms in existence off the Earth with, dare I write it, powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (though Klaatu can't fly and is in no way bulletproof). THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North's fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man's capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie's urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto..... (And please don't waste your time with the utter failure that is the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake; just revel in the enduring excellence of the original).

    Welcome to Earth (Smack!), now go home! About 15 minutes into this movie, that's what I wanted to see some Earthling say(and do) to the alien Klaatu, who, after only a couple hours on Earth, was throwing his weight around and acting like he owned the place. Of course, "Welcome to Earth!" was the line famously uttered by Will Smith in "Independence Day" as he's punching an invading alien in the head, but I guess Earthlings had more spunk and defiance in the 1990's than in the early 1950's when this movie was set. Klaatu, at this point, is demanding (among other things) an audience with all the world's leaders, indifferent, apparently, to whether we could or even wanted to do such a thing. At this point he was talking to some diplomat type, who should have shown some backbone and said something like: "Who the hell crowned you Emperor of the Universe? You show up on our planet, unannounced and uninvited, giving no indication whether you were hostile or friendly, pull out a device without telling us what it is, making an already nervous bunch of soldiers even more nervous, one of them shoots it, slightly injuring you in the process, we apologize profusely and take you into one of our hospitals, and then you start telling us what YOU want US to do!" Or he could just skip most of that and say "Welcome to Earth (smack!), now go home!" At this point Klaatu had merely been pushy, overbearing, and a bit condescending, but things soon got much worse. About halfway through the film he is meeting with a scientist. At first they just talk science stuff, specifically how to solve an equation the professor was working on. But he soon gets to the meat of the matter. They don't like that we have nuclear weapons and are working on rockets. Their fear is we will soon use them on other planets, never mind no one on Earth has suggested any such thing. So, to defend against this (nonexistent) threat, they have robots that can kill everything on the planet, humans, animals, everything. At which point the scientist is in awe that such technology exists, apparently missing entirely the moral (or, more accurately, utterly immoral) nature of such a proposition. The scientist, like the diplomat, is apparently a wimp and lacks the guts to stand up to this spacegoing threatener of global genocide. What are we to think of a form of "Justice" administered by planet smashing robots who apparently cannot or will not distinguish between guilty and innocent, who will engage in mass murder on a scale unimagined even by a Hitler or Stalin, and all out of fear of a species which, according to Klaatu and his kind, are way behind them in terms of technology? Indeed, if Klaatu really wanted peace with Earth, he could have gone about it the civilized way. Announced in advance via radio communication that he was coming so we would have been prepared, requested permission before landing, and then asked (not demanded) that we sign a peace treaty with them. That's the civilized method of handling such matters, showing respect for the people he was dealing with, as opposed to the heavy handed approach he used in the movie. Ironically, although this movie is clearly intended to have a message, the true message may be the opposite of what the filmmakers intended. Namely, that totalitarianism done in the name of "Idealism" may in fact be worse than totalitarianism served straight up. Klaatu is presented as an idealist, a man (or alien) of peace, but in reality his morality is that of a thug, the classic bully's line of "Do as I say, or I'll bash your face in!" Give me the aliens of "Independence Day" over Klaatu and his ilk any time. They, too, threaten to wipe us out, but at least they're not claiming to do it in the name of "Peace". Anyway, so much for that. Putting aside the rather disturbing moral and philosophical issues raised by this movie, how does it rate purely as entertainment? On that scale, pretty good. The story itself is simple and well told, the acting generally solid. Patricia Neal is the only real star in this movie, and it shows, since her acting is on a level well above the rest. The filmmakers seemed to recognize the low level of special effects available at the time, so, for example, they simply have KLaatu played by a human actor with no attempts to make him look "Alien", not even such gimmicks as Spock style pointy ears. The ship is your basic flying saucer, no attempt is made to explain its propulsion system nor other forms of alien technology. This was the early 1950's and the science fiction movie genre was in its infancy. Later movies, like the Star Wars, Terminator, Alien, and Matrix series would be far more sophisticated, but then they had earlier movies such as this one to learn from. 5/10

A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.

    I can see why critics are giving this one a lot of positive reviews. It's a sci-fi film with substance and way ahead of it's time. It has elements of humanity and what we take for granted. Even in today's society people are just mad about the world and after each others throats. Even if this movie was made in the 50's the nature of human beings didn't change one bit but gotten worse. I can tell why this movie stands out even today and how it was such a unique movie when it first came out. It doesn't have that generic monstrous looking aliens with ray guns or that super friendly alien thing going on. In fact the alien that comes from outer space is the most human like alien I have ever seen. I am not saying this is a positive or negative aspect to the alien genre. But the only difference seems to be the fact that the alien Klaatu has more knowledge and better technology. I thought this movie would have been better though if it showed Klaatue getting to have more of a bonding and relationship with the human race. He does to a degree but not that much with just the scene of him hanging out in Washington D.C. with a boy. Now to be honest I didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining but it does have substance and a message. And I thought the ending was great. It's one of those endings where the message is clear but leaves it up to the audiences. 7/10

    Being a science fiction lover, I forced myself to see this movie. Fact remains that in our time, such movie can not carry our imagination away anymore... but it's interesting to think that in those years (1950's) it probably did! When seeing it now, I get bored and often thought "clichee", but the reason for that is that this was probably a trend setting movie for many SF stories later on. Also, I was wondering the link between how "the world/society/politics" would act in the real world vs in the movie; and how that has changed over time. IN the movie I often got irritated by thinking "damn, how stupid can they (the world) be to act in such foolish way (shooting an a friendly and innocent alien), it seems so logic that that is not the right thing to do now, but back then... it was maybe different (that's just one example). Anyway. I gave it a 7. It's always hard to judge an old movie. If today was 1955, then I would maybe have given it a 10?

    Science Fiction explores endless possibilities, in particular the future and advancement of mankind. During the 50s however, the genre was not given the credit it deserves. Works of cinematic science fiction lumped into the B-movie class and no one ever expected much of them. Back then, people had yet to realize the genre's full potential, which would later become evident in Star Trek and Star Wars. It wasn't until Robert Wise, indisputably one of films most accomplished directors made The Day the Earth Stood Still and delivered an approach like no other in science fiction that the genre achieved a whole new level of appreciation. As an avid fan of science fiction, I have been familiar with this movie for a long time, but I never understood just how impactful and revolutionary it was until now. In the movie, humanity was at the dawn of a new age. With the discovery of nuclear power, it was thought that mankind would soon be ready to explore the depths of outer space and discover that we are not alone in the universe. But the human race, given its fallible and conflicting nature, was not yet ready to take the next step without risking the annihilation of the human race. It falls to the humanoid extra-terrestrial being Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to warn the leaders of the planet Earth of the dangerous path they were on. Realizing that the leaders are unwilling to cooperate, Klaatu is forced to go into hiding. He takes refuge in a boarding house under the alias "Mr. Carpenter" and lives among a family that personifies the goodness of human nature. He realizes that someday soon, humans may be ready for the great beyond. Some of the effects, although crude by today's standards, are very appealing, but Robert Wise's film is not about how spectacular special effects can be, nor does it adhere to the conventional formula of human heroes triumphing over villainous aliens. The brilliance is in the many themes that Wise develops in a world at a time of warfare and fear. One of my favorite moments involves Klaatu and the young Bobby (Billy Gray) as Klaatu and the rest of the viewers are given a glimpse of 50s lifestyle. Klaatu perfectly captures the essence of being a stranger in a strange land as alien to the human world as humans are to his own. Klaatu sees the world through the perspective of Bobby. Looking through the eyes of an innocent child is often the best way to view life. Backed up by a strong script and adrenaline pumping tension, the theme of human goodness and the need to emphasize the better side of human nature is expressed beautifully with Robert Wise's unique blend of irresistible charm and drama features. Robert Wise boldly went where no filmmaker had gone before with The Day the Earth Stood Still, giving us a science fiction movie that made people question the nature of mankind and the direction we are heading. In the post war/cold war era, a time of desperation and terror, Wise ushered a ray of hope and delivered a small glimpse of Sci-fi potential that future generations would build on. People would never look at the genre the same way again and for that Mr. Wise has my everlasting gratitude.

    When a spaceship lands in Washington DC it is surrounded by an army fearing it may be dangerous. After a couple of hours it opens and a man in a strange space suit emerges; as he approaches the soldiers with his hand outstretched a solder thinks he is preparing to fire a weapon so shoots him. After this a giant robot comes out and fires a beam that destroys the weapons aimed at it. The man, named Klaatu, is taken to hospital and after he is treated he says he must talk to all world leaders to deliver a message; the problem is the world it too divided for leaders to agree to such a demand. Klaatu is told he must stay in the hospital but he escapes creating a panic as everybody wonders where the dangerous spaceman has gone he has taken up residence with a local family where he rents a room under the name of Carpenter. He makes friends with the young boy of the family and from him learns the identity of the leading scientist so pays him a visit. He agrees to arrange a meeting of world scientists but by now people are starting to get suspicious of him and, as he warns, if he dies the robot could destroy everything on Earth. This film is rightfully considered a classic; many things we see here would be repeated in films for decades to come what alien invasion film these days doesn't feature reaction shots from people around the world? It makes a refreshing change that the 'invader' is not really part of an invasion force; he is just there to warn the world that more powerful planets see Earth's development of rockets and nuclear weapons as a threat that will be eliminated if necessary. The film nicely captures the paranoia of the cold war as almost everybody fears Klaatu. Klaatu himself provides the voice of reason as he tries to persuade people of the importance of his message; some people listen of course but not those that matter and his demonstration of power just makes the authorities more determined to kill him. If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must see; obviously some aspects are slightly dated but it is far less dated than one might expect from as sixty year old black and white film; I'm sure that sixty years from now people will be watching this not the recent remake.

    "There must be security for all or no one is secure."- Klaatu, to the world's leaders at the conclusion of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Here is the ne plus ultra for sci-fi movies. It does not pander to the child in us like E.T. It does not befuddle with dazzling images like 2001. Though it does present a threat from outer space, it does not take the form of a drooling, acid-for-blood whatsis with razor fangs and a hunger for human flesh. Instead, it proposes that there are indeed humanoid lifeforms in existence off the Earth with, dare I write it, powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (though Klaatu can't fly and is in no way bulletproof). THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North's fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man's capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie's urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto..... (And please don't waste your time with the utter failure that is the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake; just revel in the enduring excellence of the original).

    Welcome to Earth (Smack!), now go home! About 15 minutes into this movie, that's what I wanted to see some Earthling say(and do) to the alien Klaatu, who, after only a couple hours on Earth, was throwing his weight around and acting like he owned the place. Of course, "Welcome to Earth!" was the line famously uttered by Will Smith in "Independence Day" as he's punching an invading alien in the head, but I guess Earthlings had more spunk and defiance in the 1990's than in the early 1950's when this movie was set. Klaatu, at this point, is demanding (among other things) an audience with all the world's leaders, indifferent, apparently, to whether we could or even wanted to do such a thing. At this point he was talking to some diplomat type, who should have shown some backbone and said something like: "Who the hell crowned you Emperor of the Universe? You show up on our planet, unannounced and uninvited, giving no indication whether you were hostile or friendly, pull out a device without telling us what it is, making an already nervous bunch of soldiers even more nervous, one of them shoots it, slightly injuring you in the process, we apologize profusely and take you into one of our hospitals, and then you start telling us what YOU want US to do!" Or he could just skip most of that and say "Welcome to Earth (smack!), now go home!" At this point Klaatu had merely been pushy, overbearing, and a bit condescending, but things soon got much worse. About halfway through the film he is meeting with a scientist. At first they just talk science stuff, specifically how to solve an equation the professor was working on. But he soon gets to the meat of the matter. They don't like that we have nuclear weapons and are working on rockets. Their fear is we will soon use them on other planets, never mind no one on Earth has suggested any such thing. So, to defend against this (nonexistent) threat, they have robots that can kill everything on the planet, humans, animals, everything. At which point the scientist is in awe that such technology exists, apparently missing entirely the moral (or, more accurately, utterly immoral) nature of such a proposition. The scientist, like the diplomat, is apparently a wimp and lacks the guts to stand up to this spacegoing threatener of global genocide. What are we to think of a form of "Justice" administered by planet smashing robots who apparently cannot or will not distinguish between guilty and innocent, who will engage in mass murder on a scale unimagined even by a Hitler or Stalin, and all out of fear of a species which, according to Klaatu and his kind, are way behind them in terms of technology? Indeed, if Klaatu really wanted peace with Earth, he could have gone about it the civilized way. Announced in advance via radio communication that he was coming so we would have been prepared, requested permission before landing, and then asked (not demanded) that we sign a peace treaty with them. That's the civilized method of handling such matters, showing respect for the people he was dealing with, as opposed to the heavy handed approach he used in the movie. Ironically, although this movie is clearly intended to have a message, the true message may be the opposite of what the filmmakers intended. Namely, that totalitarianism done in the name of "Idealism" may in fact be worse than totalitarianism served straight up. Klaatu is presented as an idealist, a man (or alien) of peace, but in reality his morality is that of a thug, the classic bully's line of "Do as I say, or I'll bash your face in!" Give me the aliens of "Independence Day" over Klaatu and his ilk any time. They, too, threaten to wipe us out, but at least they're not claiming to do it in the name of "Peace". Anyway, so much for that. Putting aside the rather disturbing moral and philosophical issues raised by this movie, how does it rate purely as entertainment? On that scale, pretty good. The story itself is simple and well told, the acting generally solid. Patricia Neal is the only real star in this movie, and it shows, since her acting is on a level well above the rest. The filmmakers seemed to recognize the low level of special effects available at the time, so, for example, they simply have KLaatu played by a human actor with no attempts to make him look "Alien", not even such gimmicks as Spock style pointy ears. The ship is your basic flying saucer, no attempt is made to explain its propulsion system nor other forms of alien technology. This was the early 1950's and the science fiction movie genre was in its infancy. Later movies, like the Star Wars, Terminator, Alien, and Matrix series would be far more sophisticated, but then they had earlier movies such as this one to learn from. 5/10

    While I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, I watched this classic for the first time last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it! Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu, a tall, dignified alien who travels 250 million miles from an unnamed planet to Washington, D.C. He is accompanied by Gort (Lock Martin), a gigantic robot that can destroy weapons with a powerful laser beam. Klaatu takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray). (Incidentally, Gray would later play Bud Anderson in the hit TV series "Father Knows Best".) In summary, Klaatu warns the people on earth that they must either pursue peace or face obliteration. For me, everything about this movie meshes very well - the intelligent plot, the superb cast, the eerie soundtrack, and the modest special effects. Trivia fans will note the obvious parallels between Klaatu and Jesus, e.g. Mr. Carpenter is Klaatu's alias, he prophesies destruction on earth, he dies and later comes back to life. The only thing I wish the screenwriters had changed would be to include Bobby in the final scene - especially considering that he and Klaatu become good friends during the alien's stay in Washington. Other than that, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a sci-fi masterpiece that just gets better with age! Yes, technology has changed, but the film's message remains highly relevant to this day.

    This movie is good, but not great. The movie's theme is obvious - war is bad, peace is good, and the human race better listen up, or else. Michael Rennie plays the principal role with dignity, which prevents the movie from becoming a spoof. Hugh Marlowe plays what is perhaps the most realistic character in the story and whose character reveals the kind of character flaws which have brought the human race to the brink of destruction. The special effects are surprisingly good. What is not that good is the contrived nature of the story with its obvious political spin. Also, the response to the alien's arrival is surprisingly understated. True, the alien is shot, twice, but given his unexpected arrival and the weapon he brought, a robot that could destroy the earth, such a response is not implausible. That is, the humans have cause to feel alarmed which this movie seems to suggest is an overreaction. The alien's unveiled threat of destruction should have been enough to send this alien packing. Any message delivered at the point of gun, so to speak, is a message that is not worth its weight in words. Now, the movie is well made - the story is straight forward and the acting is strong. This movie had great value as a cinematic antique.

    "Klaatu barada nikto!" When it comes to the Sci-Fi sub-genre of "Alien Visitation" flicks, I honestly don't think that they get much more intelligent and thought-provoking as this sparkling gem from 1951. If there are other such "Alien Visitation" flicks out there that do promote this satisfying level of genuine intelligence in their stories, then I would sure like to hear about them. (Please feel free to message me with their titles) Impressively directed by Robert Wise, The Day The Earth Stood Still (TDTESS) actually did manage to deliver quite a seamless and evocative blend of the ordinary melded very nicely with the fantastic. This is the sort of motion picture that really gives the viewer the pleasant opportunity of actually getting to know (and, maybe, even like) its characters. Even the 10 year-old kid, Bobby Benson, was a likable sort. And, believe me, I usually loathe kids in movies. They almost never fail to be totally irksome and nothing but spoiled, little, snot-nosed brats. Yet, here in TDTESS, the young Billy Gray's portrayal of Bobby was very much like a literal breath of fresh air. This youthful, wide-eyed actor really seemed to understand his character and make him interesting. Anyways - Traveling at warp-speed (that's 4000 mph.) and taking a 5-month, 250 million mile journey to get here, TDTESS's story has Klaatu, the very distinguished and cool-headed alien, arriving in Washington, DC in order to deliver his dire, top-priority message to all of us naughty-naughty Earthlings. After being observed for many years by other outer-planetary civilizations, it has been determined that (through the discovery of atomic power) we Earthlings, with our unbridled destructiveness, have become a very-very serious threat to the overall peace and security of the other planets which exist in this endlessly vast universe. Klaatu must now address all nations of the Earth and somehow convince one and all to cease with these violent ways, or else face some mighty devastating consequences. You can bet that if Klaatu's firm words of warning can't induce us Earthlings to reconsider our ways, then, believe me, Gort, the all-powerful robot, definitely has his own special brand of persuasion that doesn't take "No" for an answer. Trust me - In spite of its flaws, TDTESS is, without question, a classic Sci-Fi/Thriller that's really worth its weight in gold. And "Klaatu barada nikto!" to you, too! P.S. - This film's 2008 remake was an absolutely despicable desecration of the highest order.

    I first saw this on NBC's "Saturday Night at the Movies". I never saw it on a big screen. The robot, "Gort" was not as scary on a 21" TV set, but when his "laser eye" opened it gave me chills and it still does. Remarkably simple special effects by today's standards yet highly effective. That "creepy" classic music. Gaunt and tall (6'4") Michael Rennie looks like an alien. Sam Jaffe is the perfect "Einstein-like" eccentric scientist. Patricia Neal, Billy Gray and Hugh Marlowe are credible as the supporting cast in the most unusual sci-fi film ever made. The studio "sold" it as a "monster" movie, which it never was. The robot carries a blond-haired bimbo (in a sultry red dress) in its arms on the lobby cards. Patricia was not blond and did not wear a "red" dress, though it's hard to tell in a b/w movie. It's one of the most thoughtful fantasy films ever made, although not perfect. The "speeded-up" film in the panic scenes looks very fake. The Army is portrayed as brainless and heartless. Poor Gort had wardrobe issues: You can see his air holes and zipper. Even the support "wires" as he carries Patricia back to the spaceship. The Earth doesn't really "stand still". The aliens just neutralize most electricity. That's not very scary, or is it? The movie's "message" is still relevant after 60 years. The people of Earth must learn to live in peace or someday we will all be blasted off the Earth. Whether we will kill ourselves off or are vaporized by alien robots like "Gort" still remains to be seen. A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.

Klaatu himself provides the voice of reason as he tries to persuade people of the importance of his message; some people listen of course but not those that matter and his demonstration of power just makes the authorities more determined to kill him. If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must see; obviously some aspects are slightly dated but it is far less dated than one might expect from as sixty year old black and white film; I'm sure that sixty years from now people will be watching this not the recent remake.

    "There must be security for all or no one is secure."- Klaatu, to the world's leaders at the conclusion of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Here is the ne plus ultra for sci-fi movies. It does not pander to the child in us like E.T. It does not befuddle with dazzling images like 2001. Though it does present a threat from outer space, it does not take the form of a drooling, acid-for-blood whatsis with razor fangs and a hunger for human flesh. Instead, it proposes that there are indeed humanoid lifeforms in existence off the Earth with, dare I write it, powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (though Klaatu can't fly and is in no way bulletproof). THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North's fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man's capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie's urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto..... (And please don't waste your time with the utter failure that is the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake; just revel in the enduring excellence of the original).

    Welcome to Earth (Smack!), now go home! About 15 minutes into this movie, that's what I wanted to see some Earthling say(and do) to the alien Klaatu, who, after only a couple hours on Earth, was throwing his weight around and acting like he owned the place. Of course, "Welcome to Earth!" was the line famously uttered by Will Smith in "Independence Day" as he's punching an invading alien in the head, but I guess Earthlings had more spunk and defiance in the 1990's than in the early 1950's when this movie was set. Klaatu, at this point, is demanding (among other things) an audience with all the world's leaders, indifferent, apparently, to whether we could or even wanted to do such a thing. At this point he was talking to some diplomat type, who should have shown some backbone and said something like: "Who the hell crowned you Emperor of the Universe? You show up on our planet, unannounced and uninvited, giving no indication whether you were hostile or friendly, pull out a device without telling us what it is, making an already nervous bunch of soldiers even more nervous, one of them shoots it, slightly injuring you in the process, we apologize profusely and take you into one of our hospitals, and then you start telling us what YOU want US to do!" Or he could just skip most of that and say "Welcome to Earth (smack!), now go home!" At this point Klaatu had merely been pushy, overbearing, and a bit condescending, but things soon got much worse. About halfway through the film he is meeting with a scientist. At first they just talk science stuff, specifically how to solve an equation the professor was working on. But he soon gets to the meat of the matter. They don't like that we have nuclear weapons and are working on rockets. Their fear is we will soon use them on other planets, never mind no one on Earth has suggested any such thing. So, to defend against this (nonexistent) threat, they have robots that can kill everything on the planet, humans, animals, everything. At which point the scientist is in awe that such technology exists, apparently missing entirely the moral (or, more accurately, utterly immoral) nature of such a proposition. The scientist, like the diplomat, is apparently a wimp and lacks the guts to stand up to this spacegoing threatener of global genocide. What are we to think of a form of "Justice" administered by planet smashing robots who apparently cannot or will not distinguish between guilty and innocent, who will engage in mass murder on a scale unimagined even by a Hitler or Stalin, and all out of fear of a species which, according to Klaatu and his kind, are way behind them in terms of technology? Indeed, if Klaatu really wanted peace with Earth, he could have gone about it the civilized way. Announced in advance via radio communication that he was coming so we would have been prepared, requested permission before landing, and then asked (not demanded) that we sign a peace treaty with them. That's the civilized method of handling such matters, showing respect for the people he was dealing with, as opposed to the heavy handed approach he used in the movie. Ironically, although this movie is clearly intended to have a message, the true message may be the opposite of what the filmmakers intended. Namely, that totalitarianism done in the name of "Idealism" may in fact be worse than totalitarianism served straight up. Klaatu is presented as an idealist, a man (or alien) of peace, but in reality his morality is that of a thug, the classic bully's line of "Do as I say, or I'll bash your face in!" Give me the aliens of "Independence Day" over Klaatu and his ilk any time. They, too, threaten to wipe us out, but at least they're not claiming to do it in the name of "Peace". Anyway, so much for that. Putting aside the rather disturbing moral and philosophical issues raised by this movie, how does it rate purely as entertainment? On that scale, pretty good. The story itself is simple and well told, the acting generally solid. Patricia Neal is the only real star in this movie, and it shows, since her acting is on a level well above the rest. The filmmakers seemed to recognize the low level of special effects available at the time, so, for example, they simply have KLaatu played by a human actor with no attempts to make him look "Alien", not even such gimmicks as Spock style pointy ears. The ship is your basic flying saucer, no attempt is made to explain its propulsion system nor other forms of alien technology. This was the early 1950's and the science fiction movie genre was in its infancy. Later movies, like the Star Wars, Terminator, Alien, and Matrix series would be far more sophisticated, but then they had earlier movies such as this one to learn from. 5/10

    While I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, I watched this classic for the first time last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it! Michael Rennie stars as Klaatu, a tall, dignified alien who travels 250 million miles from an unnamed planet to Washington, D.C. He is accompanied by Gort (Lock Martin), a gigantic robot that can destroy weapons with a powerful laser beam. Klaatu takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray). (Incidentally, Gray would later play Bud Anderson in the hit TV series "Father Knows Best".) In summary, Klaatu warns the people on earth that they must either pursue peace or face obliteration. For me, everything about this movie meshes very well - the intelligent plot, the superb cast, the eerie soundtrack, and the modest special effects. Trivia fans will note the obvious parallels between Klaatu and Jesus, e.g. Mr. Carpenter is Klaatu's alias, he prophesies destruction on earth, he dies and later comes back to life. The only thing I wish the screenwriters had changed would be to include Bobby in the final scene - especially considering that he and Klaatu become good friends during the alien's stay in Washington. Other than that, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a sci-fi masterpiece that just gets better with age! Yes, technology has changed, but the film's message remains highly relevant to this day.

    This movie is good, but not great. The movie's theme is obvious - war is bad, peace is good, and the human race better listen up, or else. Michael Rennie plays the principal role with dignity, which prevents the movie from becoming a spoof. Hugh Marlowe plays what is perhaps the most realistic character in the story and whose character reveals the kind of character flaws which have brought the human race to the brink of destruction. The special effects are surprisingly good. What is not that good is the contrived nature of the story with its obvious political spin. Also, the response to the alien's arrival is surprisingly understated. True, the alien is shot, twice, but given his unexpected arrival and the weapon he brought, a robot that could destroy the earth, such a response is not implausible. That is, the humans have cause to feel alarmed which this movie seems to suggest is an overreaction. The alien's unveiled threat of destruction should have been enough to send this alien packing. Any message delivered at the point of gun, so to speak, is a message that is not worth its weight in words. Now, the movie is well made - the story is straight forward and the acting is strong. This movie had great value as a cinematic antique.

    "Klaatu barada nikto!" When it comes to the Sci-Fi sub-genre of "Alien Visitation" flicks, I honestly don't think that they get much more intelligent and thought-provoking as this sparkling gem from 1951. If there are other such "Alien Visitation" flicks out there that do promote this satisfying level of genuine intelligence in their stories, then I would sure like to hear about them. (Please feel free to message me with their titles) Impressively directed by Robert Wise, The Day The Earth Stood Still (TDTESS) actually did manage to deliver quite a seamless and evocative blend of the ordinary melded very nicely with the fantastic. This is the sort of motion picture that really gives the viewer the pleasant opportunity of actually getting to know (and, maybe, even like) its characters. Even the 10 year-old kid, Bobby Benson, was a likable sort. And, believe me, I usually loathe kids in movies. They almost never fail to be totally irksome and nothing but spoiled, little, snot-nosed brats. Yet, here in TDTESS, the young Billy Gray's portrayal of Bobby was very much like a literal breath of fresh air. This youthful, wide-eyed actor really seemed to understand his character and make him interesting. Anyways - Traveling at warp-speed (that's 4000 mph.) and taking a 5-month, 250 million mile journey to get here, TDTESS's story has Klaatu, the very distinguished and cool-headed alien, arriving in Washington, DC in order to deliver his dire, top-priority message to all of us naughty-naughty Earthlings. After being observed for many years by other outer-planetary civilizations, it has been determined that (through the discovery of atomic power) we Earthlings, with our unbridled destructiveness, have become a very-very serious threat to the overall peace and security of the other planets which exist in this endlessly vast universe. Klaatu must now address all nations of the Earth and somehow convince one and all to cease with these violent ways, or else face some mighty devastating consequences. You can bet that if Klaatu's firm words of warning can't induce us Earthlings to reconsider our ways, then, believe me, Gort, the all-powerful robot, definitely has his own special brand of persuasion that doesn't take "No" for an answer. Trust me - In spite of its flaws, TDTESS is, without question, a classic Sci-Fi/Thriller that's really worth its weight in gold. And "Klaatu barada nikto!" to you, too! P.S. - This film's 2008 remake was an absolutely despicable desecration of the highest order.

    I first saw this on NBC's "Saturday Night at the Movies". I never saw it on a big screen. The robot, "Gort" was not as scary on a 21" TV set, but when his "laser eye" opened it gave me chills and it still does. Remarkably simple special effects by today's standards yet highly effective. That "creepy" classic music. Gaunt and tall (6'4") Michael Rennie looks like an alien. Sam Jaffe is the perfect "Einstein-like" eccentric scientist. Patricia Neal, Billy Gray and Hugh Marlowe are credible as the supporting cast in the most unusual sci-fi film ever made. The studio "sold" it as a "monster" movie, which it never was. The robot carries a blond-haired bimbo (in a sultry red dress) in its arms on the lobby cards. Patricia was not blond and did not wear a "red" dress, though it's hard to tell in a b/w movie. It's one of the most thoughtful fantasy films ever made, although not perfect. The "speeded-up" film in the panic scenes looks very fake. The Army is portrayed as brainless and heartless. Poor Gort had wardrobe issues: You can see his air holes and zipper. Even the support "wires" as he carries Patricia back to the spaceship. The Earth doesn't really "stand still". The aliens just neutralize most electricity. That's not very scary, or is it? The movie's "message" is still relevant after 60 years. The people of Earth must learn to live in peace or someday we will all be blasted off the Earth. Whether we will kill ourselves off or are vaporized by alien robots like "Gort" still remains to be seen. A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.

    I can see why critics are giving this one a lot of positive reviews. It's a sci-fi film with substance and way ahead of it's time. It has elements of humanity and what we take for granted. Even in today's society people are just mad about the world and after each others throats. Even if this movie was made in the 50's the nature of human beings didn't change one bit but gotten worse. I can tell why this movie stands out even today and how it was such a unique movie when it first came out. It doesn't have that generic monstrous looking aliens with ray guns or that super friendly alien thing going on. In fact the alien that comes from outer space is the most human like alien I have ever seen. I am not saying this is a positive or negative aspect to the alien genre. But the only difference seems to be the fact that the alien Klaatu has more knowledge and better technology. I thought this movie would have been better though if it showed Klaatue getting to have more of a bonding and relationship with the human race. He does to a degree but not that much with just the scene of him hanging out in Washington D.C. with a boy. Now to be honest I didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining but it does have substance and a message. And I thought the ending was great. It's one of those endings where the message is clear but leaves it up to the audiences. 7/10

    Being a science fiction lover, I forced myself to see this movie. Fact remains that in our time, such movie can not carry our imagination away anymore... but it's interesting to think that in those years (1950's) it probably did! When seeing it now, I get bored and often thought "clichee", but the reason for that is that this was probably a trend setting movie for many SF stories later on. Also, I was wondering the link between how "the world/society/politics" would act in the real world vs in the movie; and how that has changed over time. IN the movie I often got irritated by thinking "damn, how stupid can they (the world) be to act in such foolish way (shooting an a friendly and innocent alien), it seems so logic that that is not the right thing to do now, but back then... it was maybe different (that's just one example). Anyway. I gave it a 7. It's always hard to judge an old movie. If today was 1955, then I would maybe have given it a 10?

    Science Fiction explores endless possibilities, in particular the future and advancement of mankind. During the 50s however, the genre was not given the credit it deserves. Works of cinematic science fiction lumped into the B-movie class and no one ever expected much of them. Back then, people had yet to realize the genre's full potential, which would later become evident in Star Trek and Star Wars. It wasn't until Robert Wise, indisputably one of films most accomplished directors made The Day the Earth Stood Still and delivered an approach like no other in science fiction that the genre achieved a whole new level of appreciation. As an avid fan of science fiction, I have been familiar with this movie for a long time, but I never understood just how impactful and revolutionary it was until now. In the movie, humanity was at the dawn of a new age. With the discovery of nuclear power, it was thought that mankind would soon be ready to explore the depths of outer space and discover that we are not alone in the universe. But the human race, given its fallible and conflicting nature, was not yet ready to take the next step without risking the annihilation of the human race. It falls to the humanoid extra-terrestrial being Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to warn the leaders of the planet Earth of the dangerous path they were on. Realizing that the leaders are unwilling to cooperate, Klaatu is forced to go into hiding. He takes refuge in a boarding house under the alias "Mr. Carpenter" and lives among a family that personifies the goodness of human nature. He realizes that someday soon, humans may be ready for the great beyond. Some of the effects, although crude by today's standards, are very appealing, but Robert Wise's film is not about how spectacular special effects can be, nor does it adhere to the conventional formula of human heroes triumphing over villainous aliens. The brilliance is in the many themes that Wise develops in a world at a time of warfare and fear. One of my favorite moments involves Klaatu and the young Bobby (Billy Gray) as Klaatu and the rest of the viewers are given a glimpse of 50s lifestyle. Klaatu perfectly captures the essence of being a stranger in a strange land as alien to the human world as humans are to his own. Klaatu sees the world through the perspective of Bobby. Looking through the eyes of an innocent child is often the best way to view life. Backed up by a strong script and adrenaline pumping tension, the theme of human goodness and the need to emphasize the better side of human nature is expressed beautifully with Robert Wise's unique blend of irresistible charm and drama features. Robert Wise boldly went where no filmmaker had gone before with The Day the Earth Stood Still, giving us a science fiction movie that made people question the nature of mankind and the direction we are heading. In the post war/cold war era, a time of desperation and terror, Wise ushered a ray of hope and delivered a small glimpse of Sci-fi potential that future generations would build on. People would never look at the genre the same way again and for that Mr. Wise has my everlasting gratitude.

    When a spaceship lands in Washington DC it is surrounded by an army fearing it may be dangerous. After a couple of hours it opens and a man in a strange space suit emerges; as he approaches the soldiers with his hand outstretched a solder thinks he is preparing to fire a weapon so shoots him. After this a giant robot comes out and fires a beam that destroys the weapons aimed at it. The man, named Klaatu, is taken to hospital and after he is treated he says he must talk to all world leaders to deliver a message; the problem is the world it too divided for leaders to agree to such a demand. Klaatu is told he must stay in the hospital but he escapes creating a panic as everybody wonders where the dangerous spaceman has gone he has taken up residence with a local family where he rents a room under the name of Carpenter. He makes friends with the young boy of the family and from him learns the identity of the leading scientist so pays him a visit. He agrees to arrange a meeting of world scientists but by now people are starting to get suspicious of him and, as he warns, if he dies the robot could destroy everything on Earth. This film is rightfully considered a classic; many things we see here would be repeated in films for decades to come what alien invasion film these days doesn't feature reaction shots from people around the world? It makes a refreshing change that the 'invader' is not really part of an invasion force; he is just there to warn the world that more powerful planets see Earth's development of rockets and nuclear weapons as a threat that will be eliminated if necessary. The film nicely captures the paranoia of the cold war as almost everybody fears Klaatu. Klaatu himself provides the voice of reason as he tries to persuade people of the importance of his message; some people listen of course but not those that matter and his demonstration of power just makes the authorities more determined to kill him. If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must see; obviously some aspects are slightly dated but it is far less dated than one might expect from as sixty year old black and white film; I'm sure that sixty years from now people will be watching this not the recent remake.

    Welcome to Earth (Smack!), now go home! About 15 minutes into this movie, that's what I wanted to see some Earthling say(and do) to the alien Klaatu, who, after only a couple hours on Earth, was throwing his weight around and acting like he owned the place.

Klaatu takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son Bobby (Billy Gray). (Incidentally, Gray would later play Bud Anderson in the hit TV series "Father Knows Best".) In summary, Klaatu warns the people on earth that they must either pursue peace or face obliteration. For me, everything about this movie meshes very well - the intelligent plot, the superb cast, the eerie soundtrack, and the modest special effects. Trivia fans will note the obvious parallels between Klaatu and Jesus, e.g. Mr. Carpenter is Klaatu's alias, he prophesies destruction on earth, he dies and later comes back to life. The only thing I wish the screenwriters had changed would be to include Bobby in the final scene - especially considering that he and Klaatu become good friends during the alien's stay in Washington. Other than that, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a sci-fi masterpiece that just gets better with age! Yes, technology has changed, but the film's message remains highly relevant to this day.

    This movie is good, but not great. The movie's theme is obvious - war is bad, peace is good, and the human race better listen up, or else. Michael Rennie plays the principal role with dignity, which prevents the movie from becoming a spoof. Hugh Marlowe plays what is perhaps the most realistic character in the story and whose character reveals the kind of character flaws which have brought the human race to the brink of destruction. The special effects are surprisingly good. What is not that good is the contrived nature of the story with its obvious political spin. Also, the response to the alien's arrival is surprisingly understated. True, the alien is shot, twice, but given his unexpected arrival and the weapon he brought, a robot that could destroy the earth, such a response is not implausible. That is, the humans have cause to feel alarmed which this movie seems to suggest is an overreaction. The alien's unveiled threat of destruction should have been enough to send this alien packing. Any message delivered at the point of gun, so to speak, is a message that is not worth its weight in words. Now, the movie is well made - the story is straight forward and the acting is strong. This movie had great value as a cinematic antique.

    "Klaatu barada nikto!" When it comes to the Sci-Fi sub-genre of "Alien Visitation" flicks, I honestly don't think that they get much more intelligent and thought-provoking as this sparkling gem from 1951. If there are other such "Alien Visitation" flicks out there that do promote this satisfying level of genuine intelligence in their stories, then I would sure like to hear about them. (Please feel free to message me with their titles) Impressively directed by Robert Wise, The Day The Earth Stood Still (TDTESS) actually did manage to deliver quite a seamless and evocative blend of the ordinary melded very nicely with the fantastic. This is the sort of motion picture that really gives the viewer the pleasant opportunity of actually getting to know (and, maybe, even like) its characters. Even the 10 year-old kid, Bobby Benson, was a likable sort. And, believe me, I usually loathe kids in movies. They almost never fail to be totally irksome and nothing but spoiled, little, snot-nosed brats. Yet, here in TDTESS, the young Billy Gray's portrayal of Bobby was very much like a literal breath of fresh air. This youthful, wide-eyed actor really seemed to understand his character and make him interesting. Anyways - Traveling at warp-speed (that's 4000 mph.) and taking a 5-month, 250 million mile journey to get here, TDTESS's story has Klaatu, the very distinguished and cool-headed alien, arriving in Washington, DC in order to deliver his dire, top-priority message to all of us naughty-naughty Earthlings. After being observed for many years by other outer-planetary civilizations, it has been determined that (through the discovery of atomic power) we Earthlings, with our unbridled destructiveness, have become a very-very serious threat to the overall peace and security of the other planets which exist in this endlessly vast universe. Klaatu must now address all nations of the Earth and somehow convince one and all to cease with these violent ways, or else face some mighty devastating consequences. You can bet that if Klaatu's firm words of warning can't induce us Earthlings to reconsider our ways, then, believe me, Gort, the all-powerful robot, definitely has his own special brand of persuasion that doesn't take "No" for an answer. Trust me - In spite of its flaws, TDTESS is, without question, a classic Sci-Fi/Thriller that's really worth its weight in gold. And "Klaatu barada nikto!" to you, too! P.S. - This film's 2008 remake was an absolutely despicable desecration of the highest order.

    I first saw this on NBC's "Saturday Night at the Movies". I never saw it on a big screen. The robot, "Gort" was not as scary on a 21" TV set, but when his "laser eye" opened it gave me chills and it still does. Remarkably simple special effects by today's standards yet highly effective. That "creepy" classic music. Gaunt and tall (6'4") Michael Rennie looks like an alien. Sam Jaffe is the perfect "Einstein-like" eccentric scientist. Patricia Neal, Billy Gray and Hugh Marlowe are credible as the supporting cast in the most unusual sci-fi film ever made. The studio "sold" it as a "monster" movie, which it never was. The robot carries a blond-haired bimbo (in a sultry red dress) in its arms on the lobby cards. Patricia was not blond and did not wear a "red" dress, though it's hard to tell in a b/w movie. It's one of the most thoughtful fantasy films ever made, although not perfect. The "speeded-up" film in the panic scenes looks very fake. The Army is portrayed as brainless and heartless. Poor Gort had wardrobe issues: You can see his air holes and zipper. Even the support "wires" as he carries Patricia back to the spaceship. The Earth doesn't really "stand still". The aliens just neutralize most electricity. That's not very scary, or is it? The movie's "message" is still relevant after 60 years. The people of Earth must learn to live in peace or someday we will all be blasted off the Earth. Whether we will kill ourselves off or are vaporized by alien robots like "Gort" still remains to be seen. A note to "Fox" and everyone else: A movie does not have to remade just because it's in black and white.

    I can see why critics are giving this one a lot of positive reviews. It's a sci-fi film with substance and way ahead of it's time. It has elements of humanity and what we take for granted. Even in today's society people are just mad about the world and after each others throats. Even if this movie was made in the 50's the nature of human beings didn't change one bit but gotten worse. I can tell why this movie stands out even today and how it was such a unique movie when it first came out. It doesn't have that generic monstrous looking aliens with ray guns or that super friendly alien thing going on. In fact the alien that comes from outer space is the most human like alien I have ever seen. I am not saying this is a positive or negative aspect to the alien genre. But the only difference seems to be the fact that the alien Klaatu has more knowledge and better technology. I thought this movie would have been better though if it showed Klaatue getting to have more of a bonding and relationship with the human race. He does to a degree but not that much with just the scene of him hanging out in Washington D.C. with a boy. Now to be honest I didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining but it does have substance and a message. And I thought the ending was great. It's one of those endings where the message is clear but leaves it up to the audiences. 7/10

    Being a science fiction lover, I forced myself to see this movie. Fact remains that in our time, such movie can not carry our imagination away anymore... but it's interesting to think that in those years (1950's) it probably did! When seeing it now, I get bored and often thought "clichee", but the reason for that is that this was probably a trend setting movie for many SF stories later on. Also, I was wondering the link between how "the world/society/politics" would act in the real world vs in the movie; and how that has changed over time. IN the movie I often got irritated by thinking "damn, how stupid can they (the world) be to act in such foolish way (shooting an a friendly and innocent alien), it seems so logic that that is not the right thing to do now, but back then... it was maybe different (that's just one example). Anyway. I gave it a 7. It's always hard to judge an old movie. If today was 1955, then I would maybe have given it a 10?

    A Small Glimpse of Sci-Fi Potential That Future Generations Would Build On

    Science Fiction explores endless possibilities, in particular the future and advancement of mankind. During the 50s however, the genre was not given the credit it deserves. Works of cinematic science fiction lumped into the B-movie class and no one ever expected much of them. Back then, people had yet to realize the genre's full potential, which would later become evident in Star Trek and Star Wars. It wasn't until Robert Wise, indisputably one of films most accomplished directors made The Day the Earth Stood Still and delivered an approach like no other in science fiction that the genre achieved a whole new level of appreciation. As an avid fan of science fiction, I have been familiar with this movie for a long time, but I never understood just how impactful and revolutionary it was until now. In the movie, humanity was at the dawn of a new age. With the discovery of nuclear power, it was thought that mankind would soon be ready to explore the depths of outer space and discover that we are not alone in the universe. But the human race, given its fallible and conflicting nature, was not yet ready to take the next step without risking the annihilation of the human race. It falls to the humanoid extra-terrestrial being Klaatu (Michael Rennie) to warn the leaders of the planet Earth of the dangerous path they were on. Realizing that the leaders are unwilling to cooperate, Klaatu is forced to go into hiding. He takes refuge in a boarding house under the alias "Mr. Carpenter" and lives among a family that personifies the goodness of human nature. He realizes that someday soon, humans may be ready for the great beyond. Some of the effects, although crude by today's standards, are very appealing, but Robert Wise's film is not about how spectacular special effects can be, nor does it adhere to the conventional formula of human heroes triumphing over villainous aliens. The brilliance is in the many themes that Wise develops in a world at a time of warfare and fear. One of my favorite moments involves Klaatu and the young Bobby (Billy Gray) as Klaatu and the rest of the viewers are given a glimpse of 50s lifestyle. Klaatu perfectly captures the essence of being a stranger in a strange land as alien to the human world as humans are to his own. Klaatu sees the world through the perspective of Bobby. Looking through the eyes of an innocent child is often the best way to view life. Backed up by a strong script and adrenaline pumping tension, the theme of human goodness and the need to emphasize the better side of human nature is expressed beautifully with Robert Wise's unique blend of irresistible charm and drama features. Robert Wise boldly went where no filmmaker had gone before with The Day the Earth Stood Still, giving us a science fiction movie that made people question the nature of mankind and the direction we are heading. In the post war/cold war era, a time of desperation and terror, Wise ushered a ray of hope and delivered a small glimpse of Sci-fi potential that future generations would build on. People would never look at the genre the same way again and for that Mr. Wise has my everlasting gratitude.

    When a spaceship lands in Washington DC it is surrounded by an army fearing it may be dangerous. After a couple of hours it opens and a man in a strange space suit emerges; as he approaches the soldiers with his hand outstretched a solder thinks he is preparing to fire a weapon so shoots him. After this a giant robot comes out and fires a beam that destroys the weapons aimed at it. The man, named Klaatu, is taken to hospital and after he is treated he says he must talk to all world leaders to deliver a message; the problem is the world it too divided for leaders to agree to such a demand. Klaatu is told he must stay in the hospital but he escapes creating a panic as everybody wonders where the dangerous spaceman has gone he has taken up residence with a local family where he rents a room under the name of Carpenter. He makes friends with the young boy of the family and from him learns the identity of the leading scientist so pays him a visit. He agrees to arrange a meeting of world scientists but by now people are starting to get suspicious of him and, as he warns, if he dies the robot could destroy everything on Earth. This film is rightfully considered a classic; many things we see here would be repeated in films for decades to come what alien invasion film these days doesn't feature reaction shots from people around the world? It makes a refreshing change that the 'invader' is not really part of an invasion force; he is just there to warn the world that more powerful planets see Earth's development of rockets and nuclear weapons as a threat that will be eliminated if necessary. The film nicely captures the paranoia of the cold war as almost everybody fears Klaatu. Klaatu himself provides the voice of reason as he tries to persuade people of the importance of his message; some people listen of course but not those that matter and his demonstration of power just makes the authorities more determined to kill him. If you are a fan of science fiction this is a must see; obviously some aspects are slightly dated but it is far less dated than one might expect from as sixty year old black and white film; I'm sure that sixty years from now people will be watching this not the recent remake.
