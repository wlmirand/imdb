    Some Kind of Wonderful was written and produced by John Hughes, the man who most people call the 80s king. His teen based movies did very well with audiences of all ages and are still hailed as some of the best movies of that decade. But then you get this movie, which by all accounts should be excellent, but when you look at the trite storyline and shallow characters you think "John Hughes wrote this?" Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 7/10 because, for some reason or other, this movie, with all of its unoriginality and basically second rate story, captures your attention and you find yourself watching it over and over again. The character Watts was perhaps the only refreshing thing in the film. Her blatant disdain for her friend Keith's interest in a preppy girl isn't subtle and isn't annoying. She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him. Mary Stuart Masterson did an impeccable job as the sexy tomboy best friend. Keith's character, although cute in his naive and unsure manner, isn't as likable as Watts; But this is masterfully done because you feel that his character shouldn't be as cool as Watts. You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in "The Breakfast Club" and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in "Pretty in Pink" and "Sixteen Candles." They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, "Yes, this is John Hughes."

    This is a film written by the late John Hughes. He has always had a talent for writing realistic and engaging characters as shown in many of his other films including The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, & Uncle Buck. All great films and with this one he pulls it off again. The story follows Keith (Eric Stoltz) as he tries to discover his place in the world dealing with his overbearing father who is desperate for him to go to college. Keith is infatuated by popular girl Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and he invites her on a date, she accepts and Keith along with help from his best friend, a tomboy called Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), plan the most amazing date. The cast including Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, Lea Thompson, Craig Sheffer, John Ashton & Elias Koteas is great and all bring something great to each character. The story is basic but it draws you in and doesn't let go. The scenes are beautifully shot and the soundtrack brings the film come to life. This is a really fun film with some great twists and fun characters. The standout character is the skinhead Duncan played by Elias Koteas who steals every scene he is in. John Hughes has created another under rated masterpiece. It is not as well known as Ferris Bueller's Day Off & Home Alone, but due to the more serious tone of the film, this is better. This is a great film, perfectly made and flawless. It's one I can watch time and time again.

    I was shocked to find out  don't ask me when, but I did realize it (possibly again) this viewing  that John Hughes did NOT direct Some Kind of Wonderful, a movie I've always labeled as my favorite John Hughes movie. Well, it still can be, thankfully. He did write it and produced it. So he did have his hands in some of the most important parts of the filmmaking process. Now, I do go up against many a Hughes fan of the 80s teen gen films because everyone's favorites always seem to be either Pretty in Pink or The Breakfast Club  both good, notwithstanding  and sometimes they even mention the excellent Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But, Some Kind of Wonderful, was just that: WONDERFUL, in every aspect. Music, acting, heart, dialogue, cast, comedy and romance. I viewed Pretty in Pink as a funny movie with a good heart  but not great. Breakfast Club was more about social commentary in the school. And Ferrisstrictly comedy with a dash of drama. It was my sister who introduced me to this movie (and Dirty Dancing) in the 1980s and I simply can't thank her enough. It made me a lifelong fan of both Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, though it's hard to see either in many more movies. I love the soundtrack from beginning to end, and it's one of the most listened to soundtracks in my life. And the dialogue (thank you, Mr. Hughes) is so good, I've used a lot of the lines multiple times in my life. Such as: (paraphrasing) "You can't judge a book by its coverbut you can tell how much it's gonna cost" and "I'm driving you crazy, and you're driving me crazy. And I'd rather not see you, and have you say good things about me, than see you and have you hate me. Cuz, I can't afford to have you hate me" Also, the romance was beautiful. Yeah, I understand the concepts in this movie are not entirely original, i.e. love triangle whereas one is completely blind to the one that loves him. But when the "so-called secret" is revealed, it's breathtaking. (Spoiler coming, sorry) And it doesn't hurt that the two who do get together all but walk off into the sunset (or is that moonlight?) leaving you believing this is forever. And that's my favorite type of ending where reality isn't at play. I really don't want to know what happens next. It's just enough for me to believe "they'll make it after all." The opposite also works here in this movie; I LOVED the beginning. What I refer to as "Watts at Play" is a great intro: She's playing the drums while the opening credits role and all the main characters are introduced. So well are both the drum solo by Watts (Masterson) and the first shots of the leads, that you really get a feeling of who's who and what status they play in both the high school they attend and in the movie as a hole. Brilliant. I'd like to believe the high school scenes hold up today, but its doubtful I would get others to agree with me, especially any young folk who would watch this for the first time in today's time. That's okay for several reasons: it is, in fact, based in 1987 as Watts directly points out in one scene. So, if the movie were based in a one-room school in 1865, it's a poor argument to say it doesn't hold true today. Also, I feel the themes  rebels, outcast, shy, popular, stuck up, money, disobedience, nagging parents, gossip, detention, talking backall still apply. Kids today. Whoa, let me continueKids today might be turned off by the dated nature of this film and I surely hope that doesn't happen. As I pointed out, I believe this to be as relevant today as it was 24 years ago. This is a simple movie of a boy, Keith (Stoltz) who is infatuated with taken Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and is blind to the true love that's right in front of him. Also, it helps Keith's plight that Amanda's boyfriend, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer  in a role I will forever and ONLY remember him in) is a cheatin' jerk. The story gets complicated with who's using who, who's loving who and who's supposed to be saving up for college. And there's a lot of room left over for extremely funny lines, comic tensions and deep insights into real people. I do like the script and the acting is pitch-perfect, even from the secondary roles  namely from Elias Koteas as, uh, "Skinhead." Another role I will define him as in my mind  even though I've seen him elsewhere, such as the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. But from all the things I loved about this film, such as the aforementioned great tunes, Watts (or Mary Stuart Masterson) is on my list of all-time favorite characters. She's tough yet insecure, hard though soft, smart but slacks, devoted however distant and both funny and sincere at the same time. She might have been overlooked for the Oscars or the casual viewer of this movie, but she steals every scene and shows the most depth of an already established fantastic cast. For someone 21 at the time, she acted her heart out and made an impact on me. Oh, and did I mention she plays a mean set of drums? I would love her in real lifeand it helps, she does kinda look like a guy. I'm going to sum up the above with: SEE IT. Don't miss one of the smaller Hughes (involved) films because everyone and their motherwait, probably mostly their motherslike Pretty in Pink more or think The Breakfast Club is superior. This 1980s relatively unknown film is a CLASSIC.

    I saw one site giving this movie a high recommendation as one of the best high school movies that were ever made. I decided to research the movie here on IMDb and saw mostly good praise. The rating was average, but I was bored, so I thought, "Oh, what the hell. Might as well give it a try!" Plus the summary seemed interesting and invited me in. 'A young tomboy, Watts, finds her feelings for her best friend, Keith, run deeper than just friendship when he gets a date with the most popular girl in school.' The summary makes it seem like the movie would be from Watts' point of view, but it wasn't. We only see glimpses of her 'agonizing' face every now and then when Keith's with Amanda. I was disappointed, since I was looking forward to see the whole movie from the "tomboy's perspective". Instead, the movie focuses on Keith, which I wasn't very fond of. I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was focusing more on Watts. I didn't like the ending. (SPOILERS) I mean, when did Keith even realize that he liked Watts? It was too rushed! There wasn't enough development! Except for the hot little practice kiss they shared and that bar moment. Mhm. (/SPOILERS) I also didn't like the whole message that this movie gave. (SPOILERS) Keith used all the money that he and his father saved up for his future- his college!- for a pair of earrings for some girl. I mean, I found that pretty stupid. I'm not a love hater or anything, but seriously, I know the limits. (/SPOILERS) I'm aware that this is a pretty old film and many people find it popular, but this just wasn't my type. If you're like me, who is kind of cynical and doesn't necessarily believe that you MUST give up everything for love, then maybe you won't enjoy it that much either. But if you feel like giving it a try, then go on. The practice kiss that Watts and Keith shared was well worth the watch, anyway.

    Ahh, 80's Lea Thompson. That'll do it for me, but I'll tell you more reasons to watch this love story. It might be perceived as more of a chick flick but it's not a typical one thanks to the acting and the master of teen angst John Hughes who wrote the screenplay. Stoltz isn't sappy and Thompson brings a lot of depth to a character usually played 2-dimensionally in movies. Masterson plays a tomboy to perfection but is sexy and emotional at the same time. Keith (Stoltz) has a chance to go out on a date with Amanda Jones (Thompson), the most popular girl in school, but the problem is that her ex-boyfriend is also the most popular guy in school and he happens to be a jealous jock. Sounds clich&eacute;? Not the way Craig Sheffer plays the jock. He's menacing and intimidating but Keith's way of taking it lightly and without caring is rarely seen in that type of situation. Oh yeah, and his best friend Watts (Masterson) is secretly in love with him. The acting is great in this movie and to be honest, I'm not sure why a lot of people haven't seen or heard of it. To me it's along the lines of Say Anything in terms of a good story and great and engaging acting. Elias Koteas' small part as the problematic high school student is a great one, too. Also, if you're a Back to the Future fan, it's fun to see Thompson and Stoltz together again after he got fired from BTTF. There's so much chemistry between them two that it makes you think how BTTF would have ended up looking.

    Moxie is one of my favorite words and Eric Stoltz's character showed a lot of it in this movie. He showed courage and had no fear in several situations. First, he stood up to the "skinhead" guy at school. Then he asked a popular girl like Amanda for a date and risked his life savings on her. Though at first he avoided telling his father about his college plans, he finally stood up to him as well. And finally, he stood up to the rich jerk from school. Overall, this is an above average romantic comedy with a satisfying conclusion and a great title. I love the title. The Eric Stoltz character really was wonderful. Besides his courage, he really knew how to treat a woman well. By the way, even though she was supposed to be a tomboy, Mary Stuart Masterson looked more attractive than Lea Thompson IMO.

    Director Howard Deutch and writer John Hughes team up again for "Some Kind of Wonderful", a film which rehashes the plot of their earlier collaboration, "Pretty in Pink", and simply reverses the gender roles. And so instead of a Cinderella story about a girl with class anxieties shrugging off her lowly best friend and living happily ever after with a rich and handsome prince charming, we have a Cinderella story about a guy with class anxieties who pushes aside his dreams of living happily ever after with a wealthy princess and falling in love instead with his scruffy best friend. The film is better written than most of these teen movies, sports some nice dramatic moments, and features an excellent performance by Mary Masterson, but Hughes has done better and his notion that high school cliques form due to wealth differences, is way off base. 7.9/10  This is a lightweight teen movie which nevertheless has that auteurial John Hughes stamp. Several sequences here are variations of scenes from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", released the year before. Post 1987, all of Hughes' movies would become increasingly worthless (though stuff like "Home Alone" and "Beethoven" have merit as children's flicks), the director's brand of teen angst being replaced by the foul mouthed shenanigans of Kevin Smith, the View Askew maverick stealing the plots of Hughes' films and spicing them up with sex jokes and swearing. Worth one viewing.

    On the surface, SKoW is just another teen angst movie of the 80s. Lots of parents who are squares and teenagers who are misunderstood and, my personal favorite, brooding. Where would the 80s be without the brooding, I ask ya? But what saves this movie from spiraling into a heap of self-loathing is the trio of truly likable leads. What sunk films like Breakfast Club or St Elmo's was entire ensembles of unsympathetic characters that offered no foothold to build kinship with. Mary Sue Masterson as Watts was the undeniable show-stopper. She fit her character to a tee- lovely, but covered with rough edges and a tough demeanor. Even her rival, Lea Thompson as Amanda, garnered sympathy without coming off as whiny and "poor little popular girl." The weak link may have been Keith, played by Eric Stolz, who was borderline emo at times. Plus it annoyed me that as soon as he got the girl he spent an entire movie chasing, he no longer wanted her. But maybe that's just my own frustration at high school boys. Styupid boyz >_< Overall, a very sweet film with enjoyable characters you want to see succeed, not just get a punch in the kisser. Speaking of kissers, the last scene is worth the whole film, truly some kind of wonderful.

    What, Mary Stuart Masterson's throbbing, stomping, drumming montage in the beginning doesn't count as Action or Adventure in this sensitive portrayal of sensitive youths in 1987 high school? At least the accompanying synth-track Masterson drums to sounds eerily familiar to Wang Chung's equally masterful Wang Chung soundtrack, "To Live And Die In LA". Other than that, no, there's no action, unless you count kissing. It's a reasonably intelligent relationship comedy/drama about loner-artist Eric Stoltz longing for pseudo-rich fantasy girl Lea Thompson--though, aside from her body, Thompson comes across as kind of creepy with her pre-adolescent boy's face; she certainly doesn't hold a candle to Masterson's sexy tomboy. Elias Koteas provides some humor as a punk criminal, there's tons of 80s music, and the characters all wear Miami Vice fashions to high school. On a realism level, it's a little weird when Stoltz's friends wish him as well as he's lured to the big rich-kid party where he's openly going to get stomped by a bunch of guys. Doesn't anybody care he's going to end up in a hospital? Masterson is the best actor of the movie's trio, and though her mannerisms often bring to mind a twitchy Sandy Dennis, nothing compares to the girl's close-ups. HOT! Personally, I think the flick would be brilliant if Stoltz appeared as Rocky Dennis, thus upping the emotional stakes in a sort of sequel to "Mask".

    I saw this movie when it was released in theaters back in 1987. I had just turned 19 and had finished high school only six or so months before. God this movie made an impact on me! I loved it! It is so total 80's. What does every U.S. kid in high school seem to want? He/She wants to fit in. To be accepted. Yet others in high school can be so cruel. John Hughes certainly knew how to get into the heart of an 80's American teenager. I could relate so much with Eric Stoltz's character (Keith Nelson) and with Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Watts). In high school, I had a female friend who hung around with me a lot and I had a huge crush on her. I never let her know of the crush for fear of losing her altogether. Also, I didn't live in the city where I went to school. That was basically like living on the other side of the tracks. To top it off, I even had my dad pushing me hard to go to college (which I did). One thing about seeing this movie on cable, DVD or VHSit is not the same as seeing it in a movie theater with an audience. Elias Koteas as "Duncan" the skinhead steals all the scenes he is in and makes you laugh hard. That laughter was further amplified by everyone else who laughed in the movie theater. However, Mary Stuart Masterson's heart wrenching emotion transfers very well on both the big screen and on the silver screen. In my opinion, she was the true star of the movie. Over twenty years later, I still enjoy watching this movie and consider it one of my top ten favorites. I highly recommend it.

That's okay for several reasons: it is, in fact, based in 1987 as Watts directly points out in one scene. So, if the movie were based in a one-room school in 1865, it's a poor argument to say it doesn't hold true today. Also, I feel the themes  rebels, outcast, shy, popular, stuck up, money, disobedience, nagging parents, gossip, detention, talking backall still apply. Kids today. Whoa, let me continueKids today might be turned off by the dated nature of this film and I surely hope that doesn't happen. As I pointed out, I believe this to be as relevant today as it was 24 years ago. This is a simple movie of a boy, Keith (Stoltz) who is infatuated with taken Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and is blind to the true love that's right in front of him. Also, it helps Keith's plight that Amanda's boyfriend, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer  in a role I will forever and ONLY remember him in) is a cheatin' jerk. The story gets complicated with who's using who, who's loving who and who's supposed to be saving up for college. And there's a lot of room left over for extremely funny lines, comic tensions and deep insights into real people. I do like the script and the acting is pitch-perfect, even from the secondary roles  namely from Elias Koteas as, uh, "Skinhead." Another role I will define him as in my mind  even though I've seen him elsewhere, such as the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. But from all the things I loved about this film, such as the aforementioned great tunes, Watts (or Mary Stuart Masterson) is on my list of all-time favorite characters. She's tough yet insecure, hard though soft, smart but slacks, devoted however distant and both funny and sincere at the same time. She might have been overlooked for the Oscars or the casual viewer of this movie, but she steals every scene and shows the most depth of an already established fantastic cast. For someone 21 at the time, she acted her heart out and made an impact on me. Oh, and did I mention she plays a mean set of drums? I would love her in real lifeand it helps, she does kinda look like a guy. I'm going to sum up the above with: SEE IT. Don't miss one of the smaller Hughes (involved) films because everyone and their motherwait, probably mostly their motherslike Pretty in Pink more or think The Breakfast Club is superior. This 1980s relatively unknown film is a CLASSIC.

    I saw one site giving this movie a high recommendation as one of the best high school movies that were ever made. I decided to research the movie here on IMDb and saw mostly good praise. The rating was average, but I was bored, so I thought, "Oh, what the hell. Might as well give it a try!" Plus the summary seemed interesting and invited me in. 'A young tomboy, Watts, finds her feelings for her best friend, Keith, run deeper than just friendship when he gets a date with the most popular girl in school.' The summary makes it seem like the movie would be from Watts' point of view, but it wasn't. We only see glimpses of her 'agonizing' face every now and then when Keith's with Amanda. I was disappointed, since I was looking forward to see the whole movie from the "tomboy's perspective". Instead, the movie focuses on Keith, which I wasn't very fond of. I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was focusing more on Watts. I didn't like the ending. (SPOILERS) I mean, when did Keith even realize that he liked Watts? It was too rushed! There wasn't enough development! Except for the hot little practice kiss they shared and that bar moment. Mhm. (/SPOILERS) I also didn't like the whole message that this movie gave. (SPOILERS) Keith used all the money that he and his father saved up for his future- his college!- for a pair of earrings for some girl. I mean, I found that pretty stupid. I'm not a love hater or anything, but seriously, I know the limits. (/SPOILERS) I'm aware that this is a pretty old film and many people find it popular, but this just wasn't my type. If you're like me, who is kind of cynical and doesn't necessarily believe that you MUST give up everything for love, then maybe you won't enjoy it that much either. But if you feel like giving it a try, then go on. The practice kiss that Watts and Keith shared was well worth the watch, anyway.

    Ahh, 80's Lea Thompson. That'll do it for me, but I'll tell you more reasons to watch this love story. It might be perceived as more of a chick flick but it's not a typical one thanks to the acting and the master of teen angst John Hughes who wrote the screenplay. Stoltz isn't sappy and Thompson brings a lot of depth to a character usually played 2-dimensionally in movies. Masterson plays a tomboy to perfection but is sexy and emotional at the same time. Keith (Stoltz) has a chance to go out on a date with Amanda Jones (Thompson), the most popular girl in school, but the problem is that her ex-boyfriend is also the most popular guy in school and he happens to be a jealous jock. Sounds clich&eacute;? Not the way Craig Sheffer plays the jock. He's menacing and intimidating but Keith's way of taking it lightly and without caring is rarely seen in that type of situation. Oh yeah, and his best friend Watts (Masterson) is secretly in love with him. The acting is great in this movie and to be honest, I'm not sure why a lot of people haven't seen or heard of it. To me it's along the lines of Say Anything in terms of a good story and great and engaging acting. Elias Koteas' small part as the problematic high school student is a great one, too. Also, if you're a Back to the Future fan, it's fun to see Thompson and Stoltz together again after he got fired from BTTF. There's so much chemistry between them two that it makes you think how BTTF would have ended up looking.

    Moxie is one of my favorite words and Eric Stoltz's character showed a lot of it in this movie. He showed courage and had no fear in several situations. First, he stood up to the "skinhead" guy at school. Then he asked a popular girl like Amanda for a date and risked his life savings on her. Though at first he avoided telling his father about his college plans, he finally stood up to him as well. And finally, he stood up to the rich jerk from school. Overall, this is an above average romantic comedy with a satisfying conclusion and a great title. I love the title. The Eric Stoltz character really was wonderful. Besides his courage, he really knew how to treat a woman well. By the way, even though she was supposed to be a tomboy, Mary Stuart Masterson looked more attractive than Lea Thompson IMO.

    Director Howard Deutch and writer John Hughes team up again for "Some Kind of Wonderful", a film which rehashes the plot of their earlier collaboration, "Pretty in Pink", and simply reverses the gender roles. And so instead of a Cinderella story about a girl with class anxieties shrugging off her lowly best friend and living happily ever after with a rich and handsome prince charming, we have a Cinderella story about a guy with class anxieties who pushes aside his dreams of living happily ever after with a wealthy princess and falling in love instead with his scruffy best friend. The film is better written than most of these teen movies, sports some nice dramatic moments, and features an excellent performance by Mary Masterson, but Hughes has done better and his notion that high school cliques form due to wealth differences, is way off base. 7.9/10  This is a lightweight teen movie which nevertheless has that auteurial John Hughes stamp. Several sequences here are variations of scenes from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", released the year before. Post 1987, all of Hughes' movies would become increasingly worthless (though stuff like "Home Alone" and "Beethoven" have merit as children's flicks), the director's brand of teen angst being replaced by the foul mouthed shenanigans of Kevin Smith, the View Askew maverick stealing the plots of Hughes' films and spicing them up with sex jokes and swearing. Worth one viewing.

    On the surface, SKoW is just another teen angst movie of the 80s. Lots of parents who are squares and teenagers who are misunderstood and, my personal favorite, brooding. Where would the 80s be without the brooding, I ask ya? But what saves this movie from spiraling into a heap of self-loathing is the trio of truly likable leads. What sunk films like Breakfast Club or St Elmo's was entire ensembles of unsympathetic characters that offered no foothold to build kinship with. Mary Sue Masterson as Watts was the undeniable show-stopper. She fit her character to a tee- lovely, but covered with rough edges and a tough demeanor. Even her rival, Lea Thompson as Amanda, garnered sympathy without coming off as whiny and "poor little popular girl." The weak link may have been Keith, played by Eric Stolz, who was borderline emo at times. Plus it annoyed me that as soon as he got the girl he spent an entire movie chasing, he no longer wanted her. But maybe that's just my own frustration at high school boys. Styupid boyz >_< Overall, a very sweet film with enjoyable characters you want to see succeed, not just get a punch in the kisser. Speaking of kissers, the last scene is worth the whole film, truly some kind of wonderful.

    What, Mary Stuart Masterson's throbbing, stomping, drumming montage in the beginning doesn't count as Action or Adventure in this sensitive portrayal of sensitive youths in 1987 high school? At least the accompanying synth-track Masterson drums to sounds eerily familiar to Wang Chung's equally masterful Wang Chung soundtrack, "To Live And Die In LA". Other than that, no, there's no action, unless you count kissing. It's a reasonably intelligent relationship comedy/drama about loner-artist Eric Stoltz longing for pseudo-rich fantasy girl Lea Thompson--though, aside from her body, Thompson comes across as kind of creepy with her pre-adolescent boy's face; she certainly doesn't hold a candle to Masterson's sexy tomboy. Elias Koteas provides some humor as a punk criminal, there's tons of 80s music, and the characters all wear Miami Vice fashions to high school. On a realism level, it's a little weird when Stoltz's friends wish him as well as he's lured to the big rich-kid party where he's openly going to get stomped by a bunch of guys. Doesn't anybody care he's going to end up in a hospital? Masterson is the best actor of the movie's trio, and though her mannerisms often bring to mind a twitchy Sandy Dennis, nothing compares to the girl's close-ups. HOT! Personally, I think the flick would be brilliant if Stoltz appeared as Rocky Dennis, thus upping the emotional stakes in a sort of sequel to "Mask".

    I saw this movie when it was released in theaters back in 1987. I had just turned 19 and had finished high school only six or so months before. God this movie made an impact on me! I loved it! It is so total 80's. What does every U.S. kid in high school seem to want? He/She wants to fit in. To be accepted. Yet others in high school can be so cruel. John Hughes certainly knew how to get into the heart of an 80's American teenager. I could relate so much with Eric Stoltz's character (Keith Nelson) and with Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Watts). In high school, I had a female friend who hung around with me a lot and I had a huge crush on her. I never let her know of the crush for fear of losing her altogether. Also, I didn't live in the city where I went to school. That was basically like living on the other side of the tracks. To top it off, I even had my dad pushing me hard to go to college (which I did). One thing about seeing this movie on cable, DVD or VHSit is not the same as seeing it in a movie theater with an audience. Elias Koteas as "Duncan" the skinhead steals all the scenes he is in and makes you laugh hard. That laughter was further amplified by everyone else who laughed in the movie theater. However, Mary Stuart Masterson's heart wrenching emotion transfers very well on both the big screen and on the silver screen. In my opinion, she was the true star of the movie. Over twenty years later, I still enjoy watching this movie and consider it one of my top ten favorites. I highly recommend it.

    Some Kind of Wonderful was written and produced by John Hughes, the man who most people call the 80s king. His teen based movies did very well with audiences of all ages and are still hailed as some of the best movies of that decade. But then you get this movie, which by all accounts should be excellent, but when you look at the trite storyline and shallow characters you think "John Hughes wrote this?" Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 7/10 because, for some reason or other, this movie, with all of its unoriginality and basically second rate story, captures your attention and you find yourself watching it over and over again. The character Watts was perhaps the only refreshing thing in the film. Her blatant disdain for her friend Keith's interest in a preppy girl isn't subtle and isn't annoying. She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him. Mary Stuart Masterson did an impeccable job as the sexy tomboy best friend. Keith's character, although cute in his naive and unsure manner, isn't as likable as Watts; But this is masterfully done because you feel that his character shouldn't be as cool as Watts. You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in "The Breakfast Club" and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in "Pretty in Pink" and "Sixteen Candles." They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, "Yes, this is John Hughes."

    This is a film written by the late John Hughes. He has always had a talent for writing realistic and engaging characters as shown in many of his other films including The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, & Uncle Buck. All great films and with this one he pulls it off again. The story follows Keith (Eric Stoltz) as he tries to discover his place in the world dealing with his overbearing father who is desperate for him to go to college. Keith is infatuated by popular girl Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and he invites her on a date, she accepts and Keith along with help from his best friend, a tomboy called Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), plan the most amazing date. The cast including Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, Lea Thompson, Craig Sheffer, John Ashton & Elias Koteas is great and all bring something great to each character. The story is basic but it draws you in and doesn't let go. The scenes are beautifully shot and the soundtrack brings the film come to life. This is a really fun film with some great twists and fun characters. The standout character is the skinhead Duncan played by Elias Koteas who steals every scene he is in. John Hughes has created another under rated masterpiece. It is not as well known as Ferris Bueller's Day Off & Home Alone, but due to the more serious tone of the film, this is better. This is a great film, perfectly made and flawless. It's one I can watch time and time again.

    I was shocked to find out  don't ask me when, but I did realize it (possibly again) this viewing  that John Hughes did NOT direct Some Kind of Wonderful, a movie I've always labeled as my favorite John Hughes movie. Well, it still can be, thankfully. He did write it and produced it. So he did have his hands in some of the most important parts of the filmmaking process. Now, I do go up against many a Hughes fan of the 80s teen gen films because everyone's favorites always seem to be either Pretty in Pink or The Breakfast Club  both good, notwithstanding  and sometimes they even mention the excellent Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But, Some Kind of Wonderful, was just that: WONDERFUL, in every aspect. Music, acting, heart, dialogue, cast, comedy and romance. I viewed Pretty in Pink as a funny movie with a good heart  but not great. Breakfast Club was more about social commentary in the school. And Ferrisstrictly comedy with a dash of drama. It was my sister who introduced me to this movie (and Dirty Dancing) in the 1980s and I simply can't thank her enough. It made me a lifelong fan of both Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, though it's hard to see either in many more movies. I love the soundtrack from beginning to end, and it's one of the most listened to soundtracks in my life. And the dialogue (thank you, Mr. Hughes) is so good, I've used a lot of the lines multiple times in my life. Such as: (paraphrasing) "You can't judge a book by its coverbut you can tell how much it's gonna cost" and "I'm driving you crazy, and you're driving me crazy. And I'd rather not see you, and have you say good things about me, than see you and have you hate me. Cuz, I can't afford to have you hate me" Also, the romance was beautiful. Yeah, I understand the concepts in this movie are not entirely original, i.e. love triangle whereas one is completely blind to the one that loves him. But when the "so-called secret" is revealed, it's breathtaking. (Spoiler coming, sorry) And it doesn't hurt that the two who do get together all but walk off into the sunset (or is that moonlight?) leaving you believing this is forever. And that's my favorite type of ending where reality isn't at play. I really don't want to know what happens next. It's just enough for me to believe "they'll make it after all." The opposite also works here in this movie; I LOVED the beginning. What I refer to as "Watts at Play" is a great intro: She's playing the drums while the opening credits role and all the main characters are introduced. So well are both the drum solo by Watts (Masterson) and the first shots of the leads, that you really get a feeling of who's who and what status they play in both the high school they attend and in the movie as a hole. Brilliant. I'd like to believe the high school scenes hold up today, but its doubtful I would get others to agree with me, especially any young folk who would watch this for the first time in today's time. That's okay for several reasons: it is, in fact, based in 1987 as Watts directly points out in one scene. So, if the movie were based in a one-room school in 1865, it's a poor argument to say it doesn't hold true today. Also, I feel the themes  rebels, outcast, shy, popular, stuck up, money, disobedience, nagging parents, gossip, detention, talking backall still apply. Kids today. Whoa, let me continueKids today might be turned off by the dated nature of this film and I surely hope that doesn't happen. As I pointed out, I believe this to be as relevant today as it was 24 years ago.

Also, it helps Keith's plight that Amanda's boyfriend, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer  in a role I will forever and ONLY remember him in) is a cheatin' jerk. The story gets complicated with who's using who, who's loving who and who's supposed to be saving up for college. And there's a lot of room left over for extremely funny lines, comic tensions and deep insights into real people. I do like the script and the acting is pitch-perfect, even from the secondary roles  namely from Elias Koteas as, uh, "Skinhead."

    On the surface, SKoW is just another teen angst movie of the 80s. Lots of parents who are squares and teenagers who are misunderstood and, my personal favorite, brooding. Where would the 80s be without the brooding, I ask ya? But what saves this movie from spiraling into a heap of self-loathing is the trio of truly likable leads. What sunk films like Breakfast Club or St Elmo's was entire ensembles of unsympathetic characters that offered no foothold to build kinship with. Mary Sue Masterson as Watts was the undeniable show-stopper. She fit her character to a tee- lovely, but covered with rough edges and a tough demeanor. Even her rival, Lea Thompson as Amanda, garnered sympathy without coming off as whiny and "poor little popular girl." The weak link may have been Keith, played by Eric Stolz, who was borderline emo at times. Plus it annoyed me that as soon as he got the girl he spent an entire movie chasing, he no longer wanted her. But maybe that's just my own frustration at high school boys. Styupid boyz >_< Overall, a very sweet film with enjoyable characters you want to see succeed, not just get a punch in the kisser. Speaking of kissers, the last scene is worth the whole film, truly some kind of wonderful.

    What, Mary Stuart Masterson's throbbing, stomping, drumming montage in the beginning doesn't count as Action or Adventure in this sensitive portrayal of sensitive youths in 1987 high school? At least the accompanying synth-track Masterson drums to sounds eerily familiar to Wang Chung's equally masterful Wang Chung soundtrack, "To Live And Die In LA". Other than that, no, there's no action, unless you count kissing. It's a reasonably intelligent relationship comedy/drama about loner-artist Eric Stoltz longing for pseudo-rich fantasy girl Lea Thompson--though, aside from her body, Thompson comes across as kind of creepy with her pre-adolescent boy's face; she certainly doesn't hold a candle to Masterson's sexy tomboy. Elias Koteas provides some humor as a punk criminal, there's tons of 80s music, and the characters all wear Miami Vice fashions to high school. On a realism level, it's a little weird when Stoltz's friends wish him as well as he's lured to the big rich-kid party where he's openly going to get stomped by a bunch of guys. Doesn't anybody care he's going to end up in a hospital? Masterson is the best actor of the movie's trio, and though her mannerisms often bring to mind a twitchy Sandy Dennis, nothing compares to the girl's close-ups. HOT! Personally, I think the flick would be brilliant if Stoltz appeared as Rocky Dennis, thus upping the emotional stakes in a sort of sequel to "Mask".

    I saw this movie when it was released in theaters back in 1987. I had just turned 19 and had finished high school only six or so months before. God this movie made an impact on me! I loved it! It is so total 80's. What does every U.S. kid in high school seem to want? He/She wants to fit in. To be accepted. Yet others in high school can be so cruel. John Hughes certainly knew how to get into the heart of an 80's American teenager. I could relate so much with Eric Stoltz's character (Keith Nelson) and with Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Watts). In high school, I had a female friend who hung around with me a lot and I had a huge crush on her. I never let her know of the crush for fear of losing her altogether. Also, I didn't live in the city where I went to school. That was basically like living on the other side of the tracks. To top it off, I even had my dad pushing me hard to go to college (which I did). One thing about seeing this movie on cable, DVD or VHSit is not the same as seeing it in a movie theater with an audience. Elias Koteas as "Duncan" the skinhead steals all the scenes he is in and makes you laugh hard. That laughter was further amplified by everyone else who laughed in the movie theater. However, Mary Stuart Masterson's heart wrenching emotion transfers very well on both the big screen and on the silver screen. In my opinion, she was the true star of the movie. Over twenty years later, I still enjoy watching this movie and consider it one of my top ten favorites. I highly recommend it.

    Some Kind of Wonderful was written and produced by John Hughes, the man who most people call the 80s king. His teen based movies did very well with audiences of all ages and are still hailed as some of the best movies of that decade. But then you get this movie, which by all accounts should be excellent, but when you look at the trite storyline and shallow characters you think "John Hughes wrote this?" Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 7/10 because, for some reason or other, this movie, with all of its unoriginality and basically second rate story, captures your attention and you find yourself watching it over and over again. The character Watts was perhaps the only refreshing thing in the film. Her blatant disdain for her friend Keith's interest in a preppy girl isn't subtle and isn't annoying. She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him. Mary Stuart Masterson did an impeccable job as the sexy tomboy best friend. Keith's character, although cute in his naive and unsure manner, isn't as likable as Watts; But this is masterfully done because you feel that his character shouldn't be as cool as Watts. You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in "The Breakfast Club" and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in "Pretty in Pink" and "Sixteen Candles." They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, "Yes, this is John Hughes."

    This is a film written by the late John Hughes. He has always had a talent for writing realistic and engaging characters as shown in many of his other films including The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, & Uncle Buck. All great films and with this one he pulls it off again. The story follows Keith (Eric Stoltz) as he tries to discover his place in the world dealing with his overbearing father who is desperate for him to go to college. Keith is infatuated by popular girl Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and he invites her on a date, she accepts and Keith along with help from his best friend, a tomboy called Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), plan the most amazing date. The cast including Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, Lea Thompson, Craig Sheffer, John Ashton & Elias Koteas is great and all bring something great to each character. The story is basic but it draws you in and doesn't let go. The scenes are beautifully shot and the soundtrack brings the film come to life. This is a really fun film with some great twists and fun characters. The standout character is the skinhead Duncan played by Elias Koteas who steals every scene he is in. John Hughes has created another under rated masterpiece. It is not as well known as Ferris Bueller's Day Off & Home Alone, but due to the more serious tone of the film, this is better. This is a great film, perfectly made and flawless. It's one I can watch time and time again.

    I was shocked to find out  don't ask me when, but I did realize it (possibly again) this viewing  that John Hughes did NOT direct Some Kind of Wonderful, a movie I've always labeled as my favorite John Hughes movie. Well, it still can be, thankfully. He did write it and produced it. So he did have his hands in some of the most important parts of the filmmaking process. Now, I do go up against many a Hughes fan of the 80s teen gen films because everyone's favorites always seem to be either Pretty in Pink or The Breakfast Club  both good, notwithstanding  and sometimes they even mention the excellent Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But, Some Kind of Wonderful, was just that: WONDERFUL, in every aspect. Music, acting, heart, dialogue, cast, comedy and romance. I viewed Pretty in Pink as a funny movie with a good heart  but not great. Breakfast Club was more about social commentary in the school. And Ferrisstrictly comedy with a dash of drama. It was my sister who introduced me to this movie (and Dirty Dancing) in the 1980s and I simply can't thank her enough. It made me a lifelong fan of both Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, though it's hard to see either in many more movies. I love the soundtrack from beginning to end, and it's one of the most listened to soundtracks in my life. And the dialogue (thank you, Mr. Hughes) is so good, I've used a lot of the lines multiple times in my life. Such as: (paraphrasing) "You can't judge a book by its coverbut you can tell how much it's gonna cost" and "I'm driving you crazy, and you're driving me crazy. And I'd rather not see you, and have you say good things about me, than see you and have you hate me. Cuz, I can't afford to have you hate me" Also, the romance was beautiful. Yeah, I understand the concepts in this movie are not entirely original, i.e. love triangle whereas one is completely blind to the one that loves him. But when the "so-called secret" is revealed, it's breathtaking. (Spoiler coming, sorry) And it doesn't hurt that the two who do get together all but walk off into the sunset (or is that moonlight?) leaving you believing this is forever. And that's my favorite type of ending where reality isn't at play. I really don't want to know what happens next. It's just enough for me to believe "they'll make it after all." The opposite also works here in this movie; I LOVED the beginning. What I refer to as "Watts at Play" is a great intro: She's playing the drums while the opening credits role and all the main characters are introduced. So well are both the drum solo by Watts (Masterson) and the first shots of the leads, that you really get a feeling of who's who and what status they play in both the high school they attend and in the movie as a hole. Brilliant. I'd like to believe the high school scenes hold up today, but its doubtful I would get others to agree with me, especially any young folk who would watch this for the first time in today's time. That's okay for several reasons: it is, in fact, based in 1987 as Watts directly points out in one scene. So, if the movie were based in a one-room school in 1865, it's a poor argument to say it doesn't hold true today. Also, I feel the themes  rebels, outcast, shy, popular, stuck up, money, disobedience, nagging parents, gossip, detention, talking backall still apply. Kids today. Whoa, let me continueKids today might be turned off by the dated nature of this film and I surely hope that doesn't happen. As I pointed out, I believe this to be as relevant today as it was 24 years ago. This is a simple movie of a boy, Keith (Stoltz) who is infatuated with taken Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and is blind to the true love that's right in front of him. Also, it helps Keith's plight that Amanda's boyfriend, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer  in a role I will forever and ONLY remember him in) is a cheatin' jerk. The story gets complicated with who's using who, who's loving who and who's supposed to be saving up for college. And there's a lot of room left over for extremely funny lines, comic tensions and deep insights into real people. I do like the script and the acting is pitch-perfect, even from the secondary roles  namely from Elias Koteas as, uh, "Skinhead." Another role I will define him as in my mind  even though I've seen him elsewhere, such as the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. But from all the things I loved about this film, such as the aforementioned great tunes, Watts (or Mary Stuart Masterson) is on my list of all-time favorite characters. She's tough yet insecure, hard though soft, smart but slacks, devoted however distant and both funny and sincere at the same time. She might have been overlooked for the Oscars or the casual viewer of this movie, but she steals every scene and shows the most depth of an already established fantastic cast. For someone 21 at the time, she acted her heart out and made an impact on me. Oh, and did I mention she plays a mean set of drums? I would love her in real lifeand it helps, she does kinda look like a guy. I'm going to sum up the above with: SEE IT. Don't miss one of the smaller Hughes (involved) films because everyone and their motherwait, probably mostly their motherslike Pretty in Pink more or think The Breakfast Club is superior. This 1980s relatively unknown film is a CLASSIC.

    I saw one site giving this movie a high recommendation as one of the best high school movies that were ever made. I decided to research the movie here on IMDb and saw mostly good praise. The rating was average, but I was bored, so I thought, "Oh, what the hell. Might as well give it a try!" Plus the summary seemed interesting and invited me in. 'A young tomboy, Watts, finds her feelings for her best friend, Keith, run deeper than just friendship when he gets a date with the most popular girl in school.' The summary makes it seem like the movie would be from Watts' point of view, but it wasn't. We only see glimpses of her 'agonizing' face every now and then when Keith's with Amanda. I was disappointed, since I was looking forward to see the whole movie from the "tomboy's perspective". Instead, the movie focuses on Keith, which I wasn't very fond of. I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was focusing more on Watts. I didn't like the ending. (SPOILERS) I mean, when did Keith even realize that he liked Watts? It was too rushed! There wasn't enough development! Except for the hot little practice kiss they shared and that bar moment. Mhm. (/SPOILERS) I also didn't like the whole message that this movie gave. (SPOILERS) Keith used all the money that he and his father saved up for his future- his college!- for a pair of earrings for some girl. I mean, I found that pretty stupid. I'm not a love hater or anything, but seriously, I know the limits. (/SPOILERS) I'm aware that this is a pretty old film and many people find it popular, but this just wasn't my type. If you're like me, who is kind of cynical and doesn't necessarily believe that you MUST give up everything for love, then maybe you won't enjoy it that much either. But if you feel like giving it a try, then go on. The practice kiss that Watts and Keith shared was well worth the watch, anyway.

    Ahh, 80's Lea Thompson. That'll do it for me, but I'll tell you more reasons to watch this love story. It might be perceived as more of a chick flick but it's not a typical one thanks to the acting and the master of teen angst John Hughes who wrote the screenplay. Stoltz isn't sappy and Thompson brings a lot of depth to a character usually played 2-dimensionally in movies. Masterson plays a tomboy to perfection but is sexy and emotional at the same time. Keith (Stoltz) has a chance to go out on a date with Amanda Jones (Thompson), the most popular girl in school, but the problem is that her ex-boyfriend is also the most popular guy in school and he happens to be a jealous jock. Sounds clich&eacute;? Not the way Craig Sheffer plays the jock. He's menacing and intimidating but Keith's way of taking it lightly and without caring is rarely seen in that type of situation. Oh yeah, and his best friend Watts (Masterson) is secretly in love with him. The acting is great in this movie and to be honest, I'm not sure why a lot of people haven't seen or heard of it. To me it's along the lines of Say Anything in terms of a good story and great and engaging acting. Elias Koteas' small part as the problematic high school student is a great one, too. Also, if you're a Back to the Future fan, it's fun to see Thompson and Stoltz together again after he got fired from BTTF. There's so much chemistry between them two that it makes you think how BTTF would have ended up looking.

    Moxie is one of my favorite words and Eric Stoltz's character showed a lot of it in this movie. He showed courage and had no fear in several situations. First, he stood up to the "skinhead" guy at school. Then he asked a popular girl like Amanda for a date and risked his life savings on her. Though at first he avoided telling his father about his college plans, he finally stood up to him as well. And finally, he stood up to the rich jerk from school. Overall, this is an above average romantic comedy with a satisfying conclusion and a great title. I love the title. The Eric Stoltz character really was wonderful. Besides his courage, he really knew how to treat a woman well. By the way, even though she was supposed to be a tomboy, Mary Stuart Masterson looked more attractive than Lea Thompson IMO.

    Director Howard Deutch and writer John Hughes team up again for "Some Kind of Wonderful", a film which rehashes the plot of their earlier collaboration, "Pretty in Pink", and simply reverses the gender roles. And so instead of a Cinderella story about a girl with class anxieties shrugging off her lowly best friend and living happily ever after with a rich and handsome prince charming, we have a Cinderella story about a guy with class anxieties who pushes aside his dreams of living happily ever after with a wealthy princess and falling in love instead with his scruffy best friend. The film is better written than most of these teen movies, sports some nice dramatic moments, and features an excellent performance by Mary Masterson, but Hughes has done better and his notion that high school cliques form due to wealth differences, is way off base. 7.9/10  This is a lightweight teen movie which nevertheless has that auteurial John Hughes stamp. Several sequences here are variations of scenes from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", released the year before. Post 1987, all of Hughes' movies would become increasingly worthless (though stuff like "Home Alone" and "Beethoven" have merit as children's flicks), the director's brand of teen angst being replaced by the foul mouthed shenanigans of Kevin Smith, the View Askew maverick stealing the plots of Hughes' films and spicing them up with sex jokes and swearing. Worth one viewing.

    I was shocked to find out  don't ask me when, but I did realize it (possibly again) this viewing  that John Hughes did NOT direct Some Kind of Wonderful, a movie I've always labeled as my favorite John Hughes movie. Well, it still can be, thankfully. He did write it and produced it. So he did have his hands in some of the most important parts of the filmmaking process. Now, I do go up against many a Hughes fan of the 80s teen gen films because everyone's favorites always seem to be either Pretty in Pink or The Breakfast Club  both good, notwithstanding  and sometimes they even mention the excellent Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But, Some Kind of Wonderful, was just that: WONDERFUL, in every aspect. Music, acting, heart, dialogue, cast, comedy and romance. I viewed Pretty in Pink as a funny movie with a good heart  but not great. Breakfast Club was more about social commentary in the school. And Ferrisstrictly comedy with a dash of drama. It was my sister who introduced me to this movie (and Dirty Dancing) in the 1980s and I simply can't thank her enough. It made me a lifelong fan of both Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, though it's hard to see either in many more movies. I love the soundtrack from beginning to end, and it's one of the most listened to soundtracks in my life. And the dialogue (thank you, Mr. Hughes) is so good, I've used a lot of the lines multiple times in my life. Such as: (paraphrasing) "You can't judge a book by its coverbut you can tell how much it's gonna cost" and "I'm driving you crazy, and you're driving me crazy. And I'd rather not see you, and have you say good things about me, than see you and have you hate me. Cuz, I can't afford to have you hate me" Also, the romance was beautiful. Yeah, I understand the concepts in this movie are not entirely original, i.e. love triangle whereas one is completely blind to the one that loves him. But when the "so-called secret" is revealed, it's breathtaking. (Spoiler coming, sorry) And it doesn't hurt that the two who do get together all but walk off into the sunset (or is that moonlight?) leaving you believing this is forever. And that's my favorite type of ending where reality isn't at play. I really don't want to know what happens next. It's just enough for me to believe "they'll make it after all." The opposite also works here in this movie; I LOVED the beginning. What I refer to as "Watts at Play" is a great intro: She's playing the drums while the opening credits role and all the main characters are introduced. So well are both the drum solo by Watts (Masterson) and the first shots of the leads, that you really get a feeling of who's who and what status they play in both the high school they attend and in the movie as a hole. Brilliant. I'd like to believe the high school scenes hold up today, but its doubtful I would get others to agree with me, especially any young folk who would watch this for the first time in today's time. That's okay for several reasons: it is, in fact, based in 1987 as Watts directly points out in one scene. So, if the movie were based in a one-room school in 1865, it's a poor argument to say it doesn't hold true today. Also, I feel the themes  rebels, outcast, shy, popular, stuck up, money, disobedience, nagging parents, gossip, detention, talking backall still apply. Kids today. Whoa, let me continueKids today might be turned off by the dated nature of this film and I surely hope that doesn't happen. As I pointed out, I believe this to be as relevant today as it was 24 years ago. This is a simple movie of a boy, Keith (Stoltz) who is infatuated with taken Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and is blind to the true love that's right in front of him. Also, it helps Keith's plight that Amanda's boyfriend, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer  in a role I will forever and ONLY remember him in) is a cheatin' jerk. The story gets complicated with who's using who, who's loving who and who's supposed to be saving up for college. And there's a lot of room left over for extremely funny lines, comic tensions and deep insights into real people. I do like the script and the acting is pitch-perfect, even from the secondary roles  namely from Elias Koteas as, uh, "Skinhead." Another role I will define him as in my mind  even though I've seen him elsewhere, such as the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. But from all the things I loved about this film, such as the aforementioned great tunes, Watts (or Mary Stuart Masterson) is on my list of all-time favorite characters. She's tough yet insecure, hard though soft, smart but slacks, devoted however distant and both funny and sincere at the same time. She might have been overlooked for the Oscars or the casual viewer of this movie, but she steals every scene and shows the most depth of an already established fantastic cast. For someone 21 at the time, she acted her heart out and made an impact on me. Oh, and did I mention she plays a mean set of drums? I would love her in real lifeand it helps, she does kinda look like a guy. I'm going to sum up the above with: SEE IT. Don't miss one of the smaller Hughes (involved) films because everyone and their motherwait, probably mostly their motherslike Pretty in Pink more or think The Breakfast Club is superior. This 1980s relatively unknown film is a CLASSIC.

    I saw one site giving this movie a high recommendation as one of the best high school movies that were ever made. I decided to research the movie here on IMDb and saw mostly good praise. The rating was average, but I was bored, so I thought, "Oh, what the hell. Might as well give it a try!" Plus the summary seemed interesting and invited me in. 'A young tomboy, Watts, finds her feelings for her best friend, Keith, run deeper than just friendship when he gets a date with the most popular girl in school.' The summary makes it seem like the movie would be from Watts' point of view, but it wasn't. We only see glimpses of her 'agonizing' face every now and then when Keith's with Amanda. I was disappointed, since I was looking forward to see the whole movie from the "tomboy's perspective". Instead, the movie focuses on Keith, which I wasn't very fond of. I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was focusing more on Watts. I didn't like the ending. (SPOILERS) I mean, when did Keith even realize that he liked Watts? It was too rushed! There wasn't enough development! Except for the hot little practice kiss they shared and that bar moment. Mhm. (/SPOILERS) I also didn't like the whole message that this movie gave. (SPOILERS) Keith used all the money that he and his father saved up for his future- his college!- for a pair of earrings for some girl. I mean, I found that pretty stupid. I'm not a love hater or anything, but seriously, I know the limits. (/SPOILERS) I'm aware that this is a pretty old film and many people find it popular, but this just wasn't my type. If you're like me, who is kind of cynical and doesn't necessarily believe that you MUST give up everything for love, then maybe you won't enjoy it that much either. But if you feel like giving it a try, then go on. The practice kiss that Watts and Keith shared was well worth the watch, anyway.

    Ahh, 80's Lea Thompson. That'll do it for me, but I'll tell you more reasons to watch this love story. It might be perceived as more of a chick flick but it's not a typical one thanks to the acting and the master of teen angst John Hughes who wrote the screenplay. Stoltz isn't sappy and Thompson brings a lot of depth to a character usually played 2-dimensionally in movies. Masterson plays a tomboy to perfection but is sexy and emotional at the same time. Keith (Stoltz) has a chance to go out on a date with Amanda Jones (Thompson), the most popular girl in school, but the problem is that her ex-boyfriend is also the most popular guy in school and he happens to be a jealous jock. Sounds clich&eacute;? Not the way Craig Sheffer plays the jock. He's menacing and intimidating but Keith's way of taking it lightly and without caring is rarely seen in that type of situation. Oh yeah, and his best friend Watts (Masterson) is secretly in love with him. The acting is great in this movie and to be honest, I'm not sure why a lot of people haven't seen or heard of it. To me it's along the lines of Say Anything in terms of a good story and great and engaging acting. Elias Koteas' small part as the problematic high school student is a great one, too. Also, if you're a Back to the Future fan, it's fun to see Thompson and Stoltz together again after he got fired from BTTF. There's so much chemistry between them two that it makes you think how BTTF would have ended up looking.

    Moxie is one of my favorite words and Eric Stoltz's character showed a lot of it in this movie. He showed courage and had no fear in several situations. First, he stood up to the "skinhead" guy at school. Then he asked a popular girl like Amanda for a date and risked his life savings on her. Though at first he avoided telling his father about his college plans, he finally stood up to him as well. And finally, he stood up to the rich jerk from school. Overall, this is an above average romantic comedy with a satisfying conclusion and a great title. I love the title. The Eric Stoltz character really was wonderful. Besides his courage, he really knew how to treat a woman well. By the way, even though she was supposed to be a tomboy, Mary Stuart Masterson looked more attractive than Lea Thompson IMO.

    Director Howard Deutch and writer John Hughes team up again for "Some Kind of Wonderful", a film which rehashes the plot of their earlier collaboration, "Pretty in Pink", and simply reverses the gender roles. And so instead of a Cinderella story about a girl with class anxieties shrugging off her lowly best friend and living happily ever after with a rich and handsome prince charming, we have a Cinderella story about a guy with class anxieties who pushes aside his dreams of living happily ever after with a wealthy princess and falling in love instead with his scruffy best friend. The film is better written than most of these teen movies, sports some nice dramatic moments, and features an excellent performance by Mary Masterson, but Hughes has done better and his notion that high school cliques form due to wealth differences, is way off base. 7.9/10  This is a lightweight teen movie which nevertheless has that auteurial John Hughes stamp. Several sequences here are variations of scenes from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", released the year before. Post 1987, all of Hughes' movies would become increasingly worthless (though stuff like "Home Alone" and "Beethoven" have merit as children's flicks), the director's brand of teen angst being replaced by the foul mouthed shenanigans of Kevin Smith, the View Askew maverick stealing the plots of Hughes' films and spicing them up with sex jokes and swearing. Worth one viewing.

    On the surface, SKoW is just another teen angst movie of the 80s. Lots of parents who are squares and teenagers who are misunderstood and, my personal favorite, brooding. Where would the 80s be without the brooding, I ask ya? But what saves this movie from spiraling into a heap of self-loathing is the trio of truly likable leads. What sunk films like Breakfast Club or St Elmo's was entire ensembles of unsympathetic characters that offered no foothold to build kinship with. Mary Sue Masterson as Watts was the undeniable show-stopper. She fit her character to a tee- lovely, but covered with rough edges and a tough demeanor. Even her rival, Lea Thompson as Amanda, garnered sympathy without coming off as whiny and "poor little popular girl." The weak link may have been Keith, played by Eric Stolz, who was borderline emo at times. Plus it annoyed me that as soon as he got the girl he spent an entire movie chasing, he no longer wanted her. But maybe that's just my own frustration at high school boys. Styupid boyz >_< Overall, a very sweet film with enjoyable characters you want to see succeed, not just get a punch in the kisser. Speaking of kissers, the last scene is worth the whole film, truly some kind of wonderful.

    What, Mary Stuart Masterson's throbbing, stomping, drumming montage in the beginning doesn't count as Action or Adventure in this sensitive portrayal of sensitive youths in 1987 high school? At least the accompanying synth-track Masterson drums to sounds eerily familiar to Wang Chung's equally masterful Wang Chung soundtrack, "To Live And Die In LA". Other than that, no, there's no action, unless you count kissing. It's a reasonably intelligent relationship comedy/drama about loner-artist Eric Stoltz longing for pseudo-rich fantasy girl Lea Thompson--though, aside from her body, Thompson comes across as kind of creepy with her pre-adolescent boy's face; she certainly doesn't hold a candle to Masterson's sexy tomboy. Elias Koteas provides some humor as a punk criminal, there's tons of 80s music, and the characters all wear Miami Vice fashions to high school. On a realism level, it's a little weird when Stoltz's friends wish him as well as he's lured to the big rich-kid party where he's openly going to get stomped by a bunch of guys. Doesn't anybody care he's going to end up in a hospital? Masterson is the best actor of the movie's trio, and though her mannerisms often bring to mind a twitchy Sandy Dennis, nothing compares to the girl's close-ups. HOT! Personally, I think the flick would be brilliant if Stoltz appeared as Rocky Dennis, thus upping the emotional stakes in a sort of sequel to "Mask".

    I saw this movie when it was released in theaters back in 1987. I had just turned 19 and had finished high school only six or so months before. God this movie made an impact on me! I loved it! It is so total 80's. What does every U.S. kid in high school seem to want? He/She wants to fit in. To be accepted. Yet others in high school can be so cruel. John Hughes certainly knew how to get into the heart of an 80's American teenager. I could relate so much with Eric Stoltz's character (Keith Nelson) and with Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Watts). In high school, I had a female friend who hung around with me a lot and I had a huge crush on her. I never let her know of the crush for fear of losing her altogether. Also, I didn't live in the city where I went to school. That was basically like living on the other side of the tracks. To top it off, I even had my dad pushing me hard to go to college (which I did). One thing about seeing this movie on cable, DVD or VHSit is not the same as seeing it in a movie theater with an audience. Elias Koteas as "Duncan" the skinhead steals all the scenes he is in and makes you laugh hard. That laughter was further amplified by everyone else who laughed in the movie theater. However, Mary Stuart Masterson's heart wrenching emotion transfers very well on both the big screen and on the silver screen. In my opinion, she was the true star of the movie. Over twenty years later, I still enjoy watching this movie and consider it one of my top ten favorites. I highly recommend it.

    Some Kind of Wonderful was written and produced by John Hughes, the man who most people call the 80s king. His teen based movies did very well with audiences of all ages and are still hailed as some of the best movies of that decade. But then you get this movie, which by all accounts should be excellent, but when you look at the trite storyline and shallow characters you think "John Hughes wrote this?" Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 7/10 because, for some reason or other, this movie, with all of its unoriginality and basically second rate story, captures your attention and you find yourself watching it over and over again. The character Watts was perhaps the only refreshing thing in the film. Her blatant disdain for her friend Keith's interest in a preppy girl isn't subtle and isn't annoying. She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him. Mary Stuart Masterson did an impeccable job as the sexy tomboy best friend. Keith's character, although cute in his naive and unsure manner, isn't as likable as Watts; But this is masterfully done because you feel that his character shouldn't be as cool as Watts. You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in "The Breakfast Club" and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in "Pretty in Pink" and "Sixteen Candles." They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, "Yes, this is John Hughes."

    This is a film written by the late John Hughes. He has always had a talent for writing realistic and engaging characters as shown in many of his other films including The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, & Uncle Buck. All great films and with this one he pulls it off again. The story follows Keith (Eric Stoltz) as he tries to discover his place in the world dealing with his overbearing father who is desperate for him to go to college. Keith is infatuated by popular girl Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and he invites her on a date, she accepts and Keith along with help from his best friend, a tomboy called Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), plan the most amazing date. The cast including Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, Lea Thompson, Craig Sheffer, John Ashton & Elias Koteas is great and all bring something great to each character. The story is basic but it draws you in and doesn't let go. The scenes are beautifully shot and the soundtrack brings the film come to life. This is a really fun film with some great twists and fun characters. The standout character is the skinhead Duncan played by Elias Koteas who steals every scene he is in. John Hughes has created another under rated masterpiece. It is not as well known as Ferris Bueller's Day Off & Home Alone, but due to the more serious tone of the film, this is better. This is a great film, perfectly made and flawless. It's one I can watch time and time again.

There's so much chemistry between them two that it makes you think how BTTF would have ended up looking.

    Moxie is one of my favorite words and Eric Stoltz's character showed a lot of it in this movie. He showed courage and had no fear in several situations. First, he stood up to the "skinhead" guy at school. Then he asked a popular girl like Amanda for a date and risked his life savings on her. Though at first he avoided telling his father about his college plans, he finally stood up to him as well. And finally, he stood up to the rich jerk from school. Overall, this is an above average romantic comedy with a satisfying conclusion and a great title. I love the title. The Eric Stoltz character really was wonderful. Besides his courage, he really knew how to treat a woman well. By the way, even though she was supposed to be a tomboy, Mary Stuart Masterson looked more attractive than Lea Thompson IMO.

    Director Howard Deutch and writer John Hughes team up again for "Some Kind of Wonderful", a film which rehashes the plot of their earlier collaboration, "Pretty in Pink", and simply reverses the gender roles. And so instead of a Cinderella story about a girl with class anxieties shrugging off her lowly best friend and living happily ever after with a rich and handsome prince charming, we have a Cinderella story about a guy with class anxieties who pushes aside his dreams of living happily ever after with a wealthy princess and falling in love instead with his scruffy best friend. The film is better written than most of these teen movies, sports some nice dramatic moments, and features an excellent performance by Mary Masterson, but Hughes has done better and his notion that high school cliques form due to wealth differences, is way off base. 7.9/10  This is a lightweight teen movie which nevertheless has that auteurial John Hughes stamp. Several sequences here are variations of scenes from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", released the year before. Post 1987, all of Hughes' movies would become increasingly worthless (though stuff like "Home Alone" and "Beethoven" have merit as children's flicks), the director's brand of teen angst being replaced by the foul mouthed shenanigans of Kevin Smith, the View Askew maverick stealing the plots of Hughes' films and spicing them up with sex jokes and swearing. Worth one viewing.

    On the surface, SKoW is just another teen angst movie of the 80s. Lots of parents who are squares and teenagers who are misunderstood and, my personal favorite, brooding. Where would the 80s be without the brooding, I ask ya? But what saves this movie from spiraling into a heap of self-loathing is the trio of truly likable leads. What sunk films like Breakfast Club or St Elmo's was entire ensembles of unsympathetic characters that offered no foothold to build kinship with. Mary Sue Masterson as Watts was the undeniable show-stopper. She fit her character to a tee- lovely, but covered with rough edges and a tough demeanor. Even her rival, Lea Thompson as Amanda, garnered sympathy without coming off as whiny and "poor little popular girl." The weak link may have been Keith, played by Eric Stolz, who was borderline emo at times. Plus it annoyed me that as soon as he got the girl he spent an entire movie chasing, he no longer wanted her. But maybe that's just my own frustration at high school boys. Styupid boyz >_< Overall, a very sweet film with enjoyable characters you want to see succeed, not just get a punch in the kisser. Speaking of kissers, the last scene is worth the whole film, truly some kind of wonderful.

    What, Mary Stuart Masterson's throbbing, stomping, drumming montage in the beginning doesn't count as Action or Adventure in this sensitive portrayal of sensitive youths in 1987 high school? At least the accompanying synth-track Masterson drums to sounds eerily familiar to Wang Chung's equally masterful Wang Chung soundtrack, "To Live And Die In LA". Other than that, no, there's no action, unless you count kissing. It's a reasonably intelligent relationship comedy/drama about loner-artist Eric Stoltz longing for pseudo-rich fantasy girl Lea Thompson--though, aside from her body, Thompson comes across as kind of creepy with her pre-adolescent boy's face; she certainly doesn't hold a candle to Masterson's sexy tomboy. Elias Koteas provides some humor as a punk criminal, there's tons of 80s music, and the characters all wear Miami Vice fashions to high school. On a realism level, it's a little weird when Stoltz's friends wish him as well as he's lured to the big rich-kid party where he's openly going to get stomped by a bunch of guys. Doesn't anybody care he's going to end up in a hospital? Masterson is the best actor of the movie's trio, and though her mannerisms often bring to mind a twitchy Sandy Dennis, nothing compares to the girl's close-ups. HOT! Personally, I think the flick would be brilliant if Stoltz appeared as Rocky Dennis, thus upping the emotional stakes in a sort of sequel to "Mask".

    I saw this movie when it was released in theaters back in 1987. I had just turned 19 and had finished high school only six or so months before. God this movie made an impact on me! I loved it! It is so total 80's. What does every U.S. kid in high school seem to want? He/She wants to fit in. To be accepted. Yet others in high school can be so cruel. John Hughes certainly knew how to get into the heart of an 80's American teenager. I could relate so much with Eric Stoltz's character (Keith Nelson) and with Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Watts). In high school, I had a female friend who hung around with me a lot and I had a huge crush on her. I never let her know of the crush for fear of losing her altogether. Also, I didn't live in the city where I went to school. That was basically like living on the other side of the tracks. To top it off, I even had my dad pushing me hard to go to college (which I did). One thing about seeing this movie on cable, DVD or VHSit is not the same as seeing it in a movie theater with an audience. Elias Koteas as "Duncan" the skinhead steals all the scenes he is in and makes you laugh hard. That laughter was further amplified by everyone else who laughed in the movie theater. However, Mary Stuart Masterson's heart wrenching emotion transfers very well on both the big screen and on the silver screen. In my opinion, she was the true star of the movie. Over twenty years later, I still enjoy watching this movie and consider it one of my top ten favorites. I highly recommend it.

    Some Kind of Wonderful was written and produced by John Hughes, the man who most people call the 80s king. His teen based movies did very well with audiences of all ages and are still hailed as some of the best movies of that decade. But then you get this movie, which by all accounts should be excellent, but when you look at the trite storyline and shallow characters you think "John Hughes wrote this?" Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 7/10 because, for some reason or other, this movie, with all of its unoriginality and basically second rate story, captures your attention and you find yourself watching it over and over again. The character Watts was perhaps the only refreshing thing in the film. Her blatant disdain for her friend Keith's interest in a preppy girl isn't subtle and isn't annoying. She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him. Mary Stuart Masterson did an impeccable job as the sexy tomboy best friend. Keith's character, although cute in his naive and unsure manner, isn't as likable as Watts; But this is masterfully done because you feel that his character shouldn't be as cool as Watts. You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in "The Breakfast Club" and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in "Pretty in Pink" and "Sixteen Candles." They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, "Yes, this is John Hughes."

    This is a film written by the late John Hughes. He has always had a talent for writing realistic and engaging characters as shown in many of his other films including The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, & Uncle Buck. All great films and with this one he pulls it off again. The story follows Keith (Eric Stoltz) as he tries to discover his place in the world dealing with his overbearing father who is desperate for him to go to college. Keith is infatuated by popular girl Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and he invites her on a date, she accepts and Keith along with help from his best friend, a tomboy called Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), plan the most amazing date. The cast including Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, Lea Thompson, Craig Sheffer, John Ashton & Elias Koteas is great and all bring something great to each character. The story is basic but it draws you in and doesn't let go. The scenes are beautifully shot and the soundtrack brings the film come to life. This is a really fun film with some great twists and fun characters. The standout character is the skinhead Duncan played by Elias Koteas who steals every scene he is in. John Hughes has created another under rated masterpiece. It is not as well known as Ferris Bueller's Day Off & Home Alone, but due to the more serious tone of the film, this is better. This is a great film, perfectly made and flawless. It's one I can watch time and time again.

    I was shocked to find out  don't ask me when, but I did realize it (possibly again) this viewing  that John Hughes did NOT direct Some Kind of Wonderful, a movie I've always labeled as my favorite John Hughes movie. Well, it still can be, thankfully. He did write it and produced it. So he did have his hands in some of the most important parts of the filmmaking process. Now, I do go up against many a Hughes fan of the 80s teen gen films because everyone's favorites always seem to be either Pretty in Pink or The Breakfast Club  both good, notwithstanding  and sometimes they even mention the excellent Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But, Some Kind of Wonderful, was just that: WONDERFUL, in every aspect. Music, acting, heart, dialogue, cast, comedy and romance. I viewed Pretty in Pink as a funny movie with a good heart  but not great. Breakfast Club was more about social commentary in the school. And Ferrisstrictly comedy with a dash of drama. It was my sister who introduced me to this movie (and Dirty Dancing) in the 1980s and I simply can't thank her enough. It made me a lifelong fan of both Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, though it's hard to see either in many more movies. I love the soundtrack from beginning to end, and it's one of the most listened to soundtracks in my life. And the dialogue (thank you, Mr. Hughes) is so good, I've used a lot of the lines multiple times in my life. Such as: (paraphrasing) "You can't judge a book by its coverbut you can tell how much it's gonna cost" and "I'm driving you crazy, and you're driving me crazy. And I'd rather not see you, and have you say good things about me, than see you and have you hate me. Cuz, I can't afford to have you hate me" Also, the romance was beautiful. Yeah, I understand the concepts in this movie are not entirely original, i.e. love triangle whereas one is completely blind to the one that loves him. But when the "so-called secret" is revealed, it's breathtaking. (Spoiler coming, sorry) And it doesn't hurt that the two who do get together all but walk off into the sunset (or is that moonlight?) leaving you believing this is forever. And that's my favorite type of ending where reality isn't at play. I really don't want to know what happens next. It's just enough for me to believe "they'll make it after all." The opposite also works here in this movie; I LOVED the beginning. What I refer to as "Watts at Play" is a great intro: She's playing the drums while the opening credits role and all the main characters are introduced. So well are both the drum solo by Watts (Masterson) and the first shots of the leads, that you really get a feeling of who's who and what status they play in both the high school they attend and in the movie as a hole. Brilliant. I'd like to believe the high school scenes hold up today, but its doubtful I would get others to agree with me, especially any young folk who would watch this for the first time in today's time. That's okay for several reasons: it is, in fact, based in 1987 as Watts directly points out in one scene. So, if the movie were based in a one-room school in 1865, it's a poor argument to say it doesn't hold true today. Also, I feel the themes  rebels, outcast, shy, popular, stuck up, money, disobedience, nagging parents, gossip, detention, talking backall still apply. Kids today. Whoa, let me continueKids today might be turned off by the dated nature of this film and I surely hope that doesn't happen. As I pointed out, I believe this to be as relevant today as it was 24 years ago. This is a simple movie of a boy, Keith (Stoltz) who is infatuated with taken Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and is blind to the true love that's right in front of him. Also, it helps Keith's plight that Amanda's boyfriend, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer  in a role I will forever and ONLY remember him in) is a cheatin' jerk. The story gets complicated with who's using who, who's loving who and who's supposed to be saving up for college. And there's a lot of room left over for extremely funny lines, comic tensions and deep insights into real people. I do like the script and the acting is pitch-perfect, even from the secondary roles  namely from Elias Koteas as, uh, "Skinhead." Another role I will define him as in my mind  even though I've seen him elsewhere, such as the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. But from all the things I loved about this film, such as the aforementioned great tunes, Watts (or Mary Stuart Masterson) is on my list of all-time favorite characters. She's tough yet insecure, hard though soft, smart but slacks, devoted however distant and both funny and sincere at the same time. She might have been overlooked for the Oscars or the casual viewer of this movie, but she steals every scene and shows the most depth of an already established fantastic cast. For someone 21 at the time, she acted her heart out and made an impact on me. Oh, and did I mention she plays a mean set of drums? I would love her in real lifeand it helps, she does kinda look like a guy. I'm going to sum up the above with: SEE IT. Don't miss one of the smaller Hughes (involved) films because everyone and their motherwait, probably mostly their motherslike Pretty in Pink more or think The Breakfast Club is superior. This 1980s relatively unknown film is a CLASSIC.

    I saw one site giving this movie a high recommendation as one of the best high school movies that were ever made. I decided to research the movie here on IMDb and saw mostly good praise. The rating was average, but I was bored, so I thought, "Oh, what the hell. Might as well give it a try!" Plus the summary seemed interesting and invited me in. 'A young tomboy, Watts, finds her feelings for her best friend, Keith, run deeper than just friendship when he gets a date with the most popular girl in school.' The summary makes it seem like the movie would be from Watts' point of view, but it wasn't. We only see glimpses of her 'agonizing' face every now and then when Keith's with Amanda. I was disappointed, since I was looking forward to see the whole movie from the "tomboy's perspective". Instead, the movie focuses on Keith, which I wasn't very fond of. I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was focusing more on Watts. I didn't like the ending. (SPOILERS) I mean, when did Keith even realize that he liked Watts? It was too rushed! There wasn't enough development! Except for the hot little practice kiss they shared and that bar moment. Mhm. (/SPOILERS) I also didn't like the whole message that this movie gave. (SPOILERS) Keith used all the money that he and his father saved up for his future- his college!- for a pair of earrings for some girl. I mean, I found that pretty stupid. I'm not a love hater or anything, but seriously, I know the limits. (/SPOILERS) I'm aware that this is a pretty old film and many people find it popular, but this just wasn't my type. If you're like me, who is kind of cynical and doesn't necessarily believe that you MUST give up everything for love, then maybe you won't enjoy it that much either. But if you feel like giving it a try, then go on. The practice kiss that Watts and Keith shared was well worth the watch, anyway.

    Ahh, 80's Lea Thompson. That'll do it for me, but I'll tell you more reasons to watch this love story. It might be perceived as more of a chick flick but it's not a typical one thanks to the acting and the master of teen angst John Hughes who wrote the screenplay. Stoltz isn't sappy and Thompson brings a lot of depth to a character usually played 2-dimensionally in movies. Masterson plays a tomboy to perfection but is sexy and emotional at the same time. Keith (Stoltz) has a chance to go out on a date with Amanda Jones (Thompson), the most popular girl in school, but the problem is that her ex-boyfriend is also the most popular guy in school and he happens to be a jealous jock. Sounds clich&eacute;? Not the way Craig Sheffer plays the jock. He's menacing and intimidating but Keith's way of taking it lightly and without caring is rarely seen in that type of situation. Oh yeah, and his best friend Watts (Masterson) is secretly in love with him. The acting is great in this movie and to be honest, I'm not sure why a lot of people haven't seen or heard of it. To me it's along the lines of Say Anything in terms of a good story and great and engaging acting. Elias Koteas' small part as the problematic high school student is a great one, too. Also, if you're a Back to the Future fan, it's fun to see Thompson and Stoltz together again after he got fired from BTTF. There's so much chemistry between them two that it makes you think how BTTF would have ended up looking.

The character Watts was perhaps the only refreshing thing in the film. Her blatant disdain for her friend Keith's interest in a preppy girl isn't subtle and isn't annoying. She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him. Mary Stuart Masterson did an impeccable job as the sexy tomboy best friend. Keith's character, although cute in his naive and unsure manner, isn't as likable as Watts; But this is masterfully done because you feel that his character shouldn't be as cool as Watts. You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in "The Breakfast Club" and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in "Pretty in Pink" and "Sixteen Candles." They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, "Yes, this is John Hughes."

    This is a film written by the late John Hughes. He has always had a talent for writing realistic and engaging characters as shown in many of his other films including The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, & Uncle Buck. All great films and with this one he pulls it off again. The story follows Keith (Eric Stoltz) as he tries to discover his place in the world dealing with his overbearing father who is desperate for him to go to college. Keith is infatuated by popular girl Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and he invites her on a date, she accepts and Keith along with help from his best friend, a tomboy called Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), plan the most amazing date. The cast including Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, Lea Thompson, Craig Sheffer, John Ashton & Elias Koteas is great and all bring something great to each character. The story is basic but it draws you in and doesn't let go. The scenes are beautifully shot and the soundtrack brings the film come to life. This is a really fun film with some great twists and fun characters. The standout character is the skinhead Duncan played by Elias Koteas who steals every scene he is in. John Hughes has created another under rated masterpiece. It is not as well known as Ferris Bueller's Day Off & Home Alone, but due to the more serious tone of the film, this is better. This is a great film, perfectly made and flawless. It's one I can watch time and time again.

    I was shocked to find out  don't ask me when, but I did realize it (possibly again) this viewing  that John Hughes did NOT direct Some Kind of Wonderful, a movie I've always labeled as my favorite John Hughes movie. Well, it still can be, thankfully. He did write it and produced it. So he did have his hands in some of the most important parts of the filmmaking process. Now, I do go up against many a Hughes fan of the 80s teen gen films because everyone's favorites always seem to be either Pretty in Pink or The Breakfast Club  both good, notwithstanding  and sometimes they even mention the excellent Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But, Some Kind of Wonderful, was just that: WONDERFUL, in every aspect. Music, acting, heart, dialogue, cast, comedy and romance. I viewed Pretty in Pink as a funny movie with a good heart  but not great. Breakfast Club was more about social commentary in the school. And Ferrisstrictly comedy with a dash of drama. It was my sister who introduced me to this movie (and Dirty Dancing) in the 1980s and I simply can't thank her enough. It made me a lifelong fan of both Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, though it's hard to see either in many more movies. I love the soundtrack from beginning to end, and it's one of the most listened to soundtracks in my life. And the dialogue (thank you, Mr. Hughes) is so good, I've used a lot of the lines multiple times in my life. Such as: (paraphrasing) "You can't judge a book by its coverbut you can tell how much it's gonna cost" and "I'm driving you crazy, and you're driving me crazy. And I'd rather not see you, and have you say good things about me, than see you and have you hate me. Cuz, I can't afford to have you hate me" Also, the romance was beautiful. Yeah, I understand the concepts in this movie are not entirely original, i.e. love triangle whereas one is completely blind to the one that loves him. But when the "so-called secret" is revealed, it's breathtaking. (Spoiler coming, sorry) And it doesn't hurt that the two who do get together all but walk off into the sunset (or is that moonlight?) leaving you believing this is forever. And that's my favorite type of ending where reality isn't at play. I really don't want to know what happens next. It's just enough for me to believe "they'll make it after all." The opposite also works here in this movie; I LOVED the beginning. What I refer to as "Watts at Play" is a great intro: She's playing the drums while the opening credits role and all the main characters are introduced. So well are both the drum solo by Watts (Masterson) and the first shots of the leads, that you really get a feeling of who's who and what status they play in both the high school they attend and in the movie as a hole. Brilliant. I'd like to believe the high school scenes hold up today, but its doubtful I would get others to agree with me, especially any young folk who would watch this for the first time in today's time. That's okay for several reasons: it is, in fact, based in 1987 as Watts directly points out in one scene. So, if the movie were based in a one-room school in 1865, it's a poor argument to say it doesn't hold true today. Also, I feel the themes  rebels, outcast, shy, popular, stuck up, money, disobedience, nagging parents, gossip, detention, talking backall still apply. Kids today. Whoa, let me continueKids today might be turned off by the dated nature of this film and I surely hope that doesn't happen. As I pointed out, I believe this to be as relevant today as it was 24 years ago. This is a simple movie of a boy, Keith (Stoltz) who is infatuated with taken Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and is blind to the true love that's right in front of him. Also, it helps Keith's plight that Amanda's boyfriend, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer  in a role I will forever and ONLY remember him in) is a cheatin' jerk. The story gets complicated with who's using who, who's loving who and who's supposed to be saving up for college. And there's a lot of room left over for extremely funny lines, comic tensions and deep insights into real people. I do like the script and the acting is pitch-perfect, even from the secondary roles  namely from Elias Koteas as, uh, "Skinhead." Another role I will define him as in my mind  even though I've seen him elsewhere, such as the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. But from all the things I loved about this film, such as the aforementioned great tunes, Watts (or Mary Stuart Masterson) is on my list of all-time favorite characters. She's tough yet insecure, hard though soft, smart but slacks, devoted however distant and both funny and sincere at the same time. She might have been overlooked for the Oscars or the casual viewer of this movie, but she steals every scene and shows the most depth of an already established fantastic cast. For someone 21 at the time, she acted her heart out and made an impact on me. Oh, and did I mention she plays a mean set of drums? I would love her in real lifeand it helps, she does kinda look like a guy. I'm going to sum up the above with: SEE IT. Don't miss one of the smaller Hughes (involved) films because everyone and their motherwait, probably mostly their motherslike Pretty in Pink more or think The Breakfast Club is superior. This 1980s relatively unknown film is a CLASSIC.

    I saw one site giving this movie a high recommendation as one of the best high school movies that were ever made. I decided to research the movie here on IMDb and saw mostly good praise. The rating was average, but I was bored, so I thought, "Oh, what the hell. Might as well give it a try!" Plus the summary seemed interesting and invited me in. 'A young tomboy, Watts, finds her feelings for her best friend, Keith, run deeper than just friendship when he gets a date with the most popular girl in school.' The summary makes it seem like the movie would be from Watts' point of view, but it wasn't. We only see glimpses of her 'agonizing' face every now and then when Keith's with Amanda. I was disappointed, since I was looking forward to see the whole movie from the "tomboy's perspective". Instead, the movie focuses on Keith, which I wasn't very fond of. I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was focusing more on Watts. I didn't like the ending. (SPOILERS) I mean, when did Keith even realize that he liked Watts? It was too rushed! There wasn't enough development! Except for the hot little practice kiss they shared and that bar moment. Mhm. (/SPOILERS) I also didn't like the whole message that this movie gave. (SPOILERS) Keith used all the money that he and his father saved up for his future- his college!- for a pair of earrings for some girl. I mean, I found that pretty stupid. I'm not a love hater or anything, but seriously, I know the limits. (/SPOILERS) I'm aware that this is a pretty old film and many people find it popular, but this just wasn't my type. If you're like me, who is kind of cynical and doesn't necessarily believe that you MUST give up everything for love, then maybe you won't enjoy it that much either. But if you feel like giving it a try, then go on. The practice kiss that Watts and Keith shared was well worth the watch, anyway.

    Ahh, 80's Lea Thompson. That'll do it for me, but I'll tell you more reasons to watch this love story. It might be perceived as more of a chick flick but it's not a typical one thanks to the acting and the master of teen angst John Hughes who wrote the screenplay. Stoltz isn't sappy and Thompson brings a lot of depth to a character usually played 2-dimensionally in movies. Masterson plays a tomboy to perfection but is sexy and emotional at the same time. Keith (Stoltz) has a chance to go out on a date with Amanda Jones (Thompson), the most popular girl in school, but the problem is that her ex-boyfriend is also the most popular guy in school and he happens to be a jealous jock. Sounds clich&eacute;? Not the way Craig Sheffer plays the jock. He's menacing and intimidating but Keith's way of taking it lightly and without caring is rarely seen in that type of situation. Oh yeah, and his best friend Watts (Masterson) is secretly in love with him. The acting is great in this movie and to be honest, I'm not sure why a lot of people haven't seen or heard of it. To me it's along the lines of Say Anything in terms of a good story and great and engaging acting. Elias Koteas' small part as the problematic high school student is a great one, too. Also, if you're a Back to the Future fan, it's fun to see Thompson and Stoltz together again after he got fired from BTTF. There's so much chemistry between them two that it makes you think how BTTF would have ended up looking.

    Moxie is one of my favorite words and Eric Stoltz's character showed a lot of it in this movie. He showed courage and had no fear in several situations. First, he stood up to the "skinhead" guy at school. Then he asked a popular girl like Amanda for a date and risked his life savings on her. Though at first he avoided telling his father about his college plans, he finally stood up to him as well. And finally, he stood up to the rich jerk from school. Overall, this is an above average romantic comedy with a satisfying conclusion and a great title. I love the title. The Eric Stoltz character really was wonderful. Besides his courage, he really knew how to treat a woman well. By the way, even though she was supposed to be a tomboy, Mary Stuart Masterson looked more attractive than Lea Thompson IMO.

    Director Howard Deutch and writer John Hughes team up again for "Some Kind of Wonderful", a film which rehashes the plot of their earlier collaboration, "Pretty in Pink", and simply reverses the gender roles. And so instead of a Cinderella story about a girl with class anxieties shrugging off her lowly best friend and living happily ever after with a rich and handsome prince charming, we have a Cinderella story about a guy with class anxieties who pushes aside his dreams of living happily ever after with a wealthy princess and falling in love instead with his scruffy best friend. The film is better written than most of these teen movies, sports some nice dramatic moments, and features an excellent performance by Mary Masterson, but Hughes has done better and his notion that high school cliques form due to wealth differences, is way off base. 7.9/10  This is a lightweight teen movie which nevertheless has that auteurial John Hughes stamp. Several sequences here are variations of scenes from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", released the year before. Post 1987, all of Hughes' movies would become increasingly worthless (though stuff like "Home Alone" and "Beethoven" have merit as children's flicks), the director's brand of teen angst being replaced by the foul mouthed shenanigans of Kevin Smith, the View Askew maverick stealing the plots of Hughes' films and spicing them up with sex jokes and swearing. Worth one viewing.

    On the surface, SKoW is just another teen angst movie of the 80s. Lots of parents who are squares and teenagers who are misunderstood and, my personal favorite, brooding. Where would the 80s be without the brooding, I ask ya? But what saves this movie from spiraling into a heap of self-loathing is the trio of truly likable leads. What sunk films like Breakfast Club or St Elmo's was entire ensembles of unsympathetic characters that offered no foothold to build kinship with. Mary Sue Masterson as Watts was the undeniable show-stopper. She fit her character to a tee- lovely, but covered with rough edges and a tough demeanor. Even her rival, Lea Thompson as Amanda, garnered sympathy without coming off as whiny and "poor little popular girl." The weak link may have been Keith, played by Eric Stolz, who was borderline emo at times. Plus it annoyed me that as soon as he got the girl he spent an entire movie chasing, he no longer wanted her. But maybe that's just my own frustration at high school boys. Styupid boyz >_< Overall, a very sweet film with enjoyable characters you want to see succeed, not just get a punch in the kisser. Speaking of kissers, the last scene is worth the whole film, truly some kind of wonderful.

    What, Mary Stuart Masterson's throbbing, stomping, drumming montage in the beginning doesn't count as Action or Adventure in this sensitive portrayal of sensitive youths in 1987 high school? At least the accompanying synth-track Masterson drums to sounds eerily familiar to Wang Chung's equally masterful Wang Chung soundtrack, "To Live And Die In LA". Other than that, no, there's no action, unless you count kissing. It's a reasonably intelligent relationship comedy/drama about loner-artist Eric Stoltz longing for pseudo-rich fantasy girl Lea Thompson--though, aside from her body, Thompson comes across as kind of creepy with her pre-adolescent boy's face; she certainly doesn't hold a candle to Masterson's sexy tomboy. Elias Koteas provides some humor as a punk criminal, there's tons of 80s music, and the characters all wear Miami Vice fashions to high school. On a realism level, it's a little weird when Stoltz's friends wish him as well as he's lured to the big rich-kid party where he's openly going to get stomped by a bunch of guys. Doesn't anybody care he's going to end up in a hospital? Masterson is the best actor of the movie's trio, and though her mannerisms often bring to mind a twitchy Sandy Dennis, nothing compares to the girl's close-ups. HOT! Personally, I think the flick would be brilliant if Stoltz appeared as Rocky Dennis, thus upping the emotional stakes in a sort of sequel to "Mask".

    I saw this movie when it was released in theaters back in 1987. I had just turned 19 and had finished high school only six or so months before. God this movie made an impact on me! I loved it! It is so total 80's. What does every U.S. kid in high school seem to want? He/She wants to fit in. To be accepted. Yet others in high school can be so cruel. John Hughes certainly knew how to get into the heart of an 80's American teenager. I could relate so much with Eric Stoltz's character (Keith Nelson) and with Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Watts). In high school, I had a female friend who hung around with me a lot and I had a huge crush on her. I never let her know of the crush for fear of losing her altogether. Also, I didn't live in the city where I went to school. That was basically like living on the other side of the tracks. To top it off, I even had my dad pushing me hard to go to college (which I did). One thing about seeing this movie on cable, DVD or VHSit is not the same as seeing it in a movie theater with an audience. Elias Koteas as "Duncan" the skinhead steals all the scenes he is in and makes you laugh hard. That laughter was further amplified by everyone else who laughed in the movie theater. However, Mary Stuart Masterson's heart wrenching emotion transfers very well on both the big screen and on the silver screen. In my opinion, she was the true star of the movie. Over twenty years later, I still enjoy watching this movie and consider it one of my top ten favorites. I highly recommend it.

    Some Kind of Wonderful was written and produced by John Hughes, the man who most people call the 80s king. His teen based movies did very well with audiences of all ages and are still hailed as some of the best movies of that decade. But then you get this movie, which by all accounts should be excellent, but when you look at the trite storyline and shallow characters you think "John Hughes wrote this?" Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 7/10 because, for some reason or other, this movie, with all of its unoriginality and basically second rate story, captures your attention and you find yourself watching it over and over again.

    I saw one site giving this movie a high recommendation as one of the best high school movies that were ever made. I decided to research the movie here on IMDb and saw mostly good praise. The rating was average, but I was bored, so I thought, "Oh, what the hell. Might as well give it a try!" Plus the summary seemed interesting and invited me in. 'A young tomboy, Watts, finds her feelings for her best friend, Keith, run deeper than just friendship when he gets a date with the most popular girl in school.' The summary makes it seem like the movie would be from Watts' point of view, but it wasn't. We only see glimpses of her 'agonizing' face every now and then when Keith's with Amanda. I was disappointed, since I was looking forward to see the whole movie from the "tomboy's perspective". Instead, the movie focuses on Keith, which I wasn't very fond of. I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was focusing more on Watts. I didn't like the ending. (SPOILERS) I mean, when did Keith even realize that he liked Watts? It was too rushed! There wasn't enough development! Except for the hot little practice kiss they shared and that bar moment. Mhm. (/SPOILERS) I also didn't like the whole message that this movie gave. (SPOILERS) Keith used all the money that he and his father saved up for his future- his college!- for a pair of earrings for some girl. I mean, I found that pretty stupid. I'm not a love hater or anything, but seriously, I know the limits. (/SPOILERS) I'm aware that this is a pretty old film and many people find it popular, but this just wasn't my type. If you're like me, who is kind of cynical and doesn't necessarily believe that you MUST give up everything for love, then maybe you won't enjoy it that much either. But if you feel like giving it a try, then go on. The practice kiss that Watts and Keith shared was well worth the watch, anyway.

    Ahh, 80's Lea Thompson. That'll do it for me, but I'll tell you more reasons to watch this love story. It might be perceived as more of a chick flick but it's not a typical one thanks to the acting and the master of teen angst John Hughes who wrote the screenplay. Stoltz isn't sappy and Thompson brings a lot of depth to a character usually played 2-dimensionally in movies. Masterson plays a tomboy to perfection but is sexy and emotional at the same time. Keith (Stoltz) has a chance to go out on a date with Amanda Jones (Thompson), the most popular girl in school, but the problem is that her ex-boyfriend is also the most popular guy in school and he happens to be a jealous jock. Sounds clich&eacute;? Not the way Craig Sheffer plays the jock. He's menacing and intimidating but Keith's way of taking it lightly and without caring is rarely seen in that type of situation. Oh yeah, and his best friend Watts (Masterson) is secretly in love with him. The acting is great in this movie and to be honest, I'm not sure why a lot of people haven't seen or heard of it. To me it's along the lines of Say Anything in terms of a good story and great and engaging acting. Elias Koteas' small part as the problematic high school student is a great one, too. Also, if you're a Back to the Future fan, it's fun to see Thompson and Stoltz together again after he got fired from BTTF. There's so much chemistry between them two that it makes you think how BTTF would have ended up looking.

    Moxie is one of my favorite words and Eric Stoltz's character showed a lot of it in this movie. He showed courage and had no fear in several situations. First, he stood up to the "skinhead" guy at school. Then he asked a popular girl like Amanda for a date and risked his life savings on her. Though at first he avoided telling his father about his college plans, he finally stood up to him as well. And finally, he stood up to the rich jerk from school. Overall, this is an above average romantic comedy with a satisfying conclusion and a great title. I love the title. The Eric Stoltz character really was wonderful. Besides his courage, he really knew how to treat a woman well. By the way, even though she was supposed to be a tomboy, Mary Stuart Masterson looked more attractive than Lea Thompson IMO.

    Director Howard Deutch and writer John Hughes team up again for "Some Kind of Wonderful", a film which rehashes the plot of their earlier collaboration, "Pretty in Pink", and simply reverses the gender roles. And so instead of a Cinderella story about a girl with class anxieties shrugging off her lowly best friend and living happily ever after with a rich and handsome prince charming, we have a Cinderella story about a guy with class anxieties who pushes aside his dreams of living happily ever after with a wealthy princess and falling in love instead with his scruffy best friend. The film is better written than most of these teen movies, sports some nice dramatic moments, and features an excellent performance by Mary Masterson, but Hughes has done better and his notion that high school cliques form due to wealth differences, is way off base. 7.9/10  This is a lightweight teen movie which nevertheless has that auteurial John Hughes stamp. Several sequences here are variations of scenes from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", released the year before. Post 1987, all of Hughes' movies would become increasingly worthless (though stuff like "Home Alone" and "Beethoven" have merit as children's flicks), the director's brand of teen angst being replaced by the foul mouthed shenanigans of Kevin Smith, the View Askew maverick stealing the plots of Hughes' films and spicing them up with sex jokes and swearing. Worth one viewing.

    On the surface, SKoW is just another teen angst movie of the 80s. Lots of parents who are squares and teenagers who are misunderstood and, my personal favorite, brooding. Where would the 80s be without the brooding, I ask ya? But what saves this movie from spiraling into a heap of self-loathing is the trio of truly likable leads. What sunk films like Breakfast Club or St Elmo's was entire ensembles of unsympathetic characters that offered no foothold to build kinship with. Mary Sue Masterson as Watts was the undeniable show-stopper. She fit her character to a tee- lovely, but covered with rough edges and a tough demeanor. Even her rival, Lea Thompson as Amanda, garnered sympathy without coming off as whiny and "poor little popular girl." The weak link may have been Keith, played by Eric Stolz, who was borderline emo at times. Plus it annoyed me that as soon as he got the girl he spent an entire movie chasing, he no longer wanted her. But maybe that's just my own frustration at high school boys. Styupid boyz >_< Overall, a very sweet film with enjoyable characters you want to see succeed, not just get a punch in the kisser. Speaking of kissers, the last scene is worth the whole film, truly some kind of wonderful.

    What, Mary Stuart Masterson's throbbing, stomping, drumming montage in the beginning doesn't count as Action or Adventure in this sensitive portrayal of sensitive youths in 1987 high school? At least the accompanying synth-track Masterson drums to sounds eerily familiar to Wang Chung's equally masterful Wang Chung soundtrack, "To Live And Die In LA". Other than that, no, there's no action, unless you count kissing. It's a reasonably intelligent relationship comedy/drama about loner-artist Eric Stoltz longing for pseudo-rich fantasy girl Lea Thompson--though, aside from her body, Thompson comes across as kind of creepy with her pre-adolescent boy's face; she certainly doesn't hold a candle to Masterson's sexy tomboy. Elias Koteas provides some humor as a punk criminal, there's tons of 80s music, and the characters all wear Miami Vice fashions to high school. On a realism level, it's a little weird when Stoltz's friends wish him as well as he's lured to the big rich-kid party where he's openly going to get stomped by a bunch of guys. Doesn't anybody care he's going to end up in a hospital? Masterson is the best actor of the movie's trio, and though her mannerisms often bring to mind a twitchy Sandy Dennis, nothing compares to the girl's close-ups. HOT! Personally, I think the flick would be brilliant if Stoltz appeared as Rocky Dennis, thus upping the emotional stakes in a sort of sequel to "Mask".

    I saw this movie when it was released in theaters back in 1987. I had just turned 19 and had finished high school only six or so months before. God this movie made an impact on me! I loved it! It is so total 80's. What does every U.S. kid in high school seem to want? He/She wants to fit in. To be accepted. Yet others in high school can be so cruel. John Hughes certainly knew how to get into the heart of an 80's American teenager. I could relate so much with Eric Stoltz's character (Keith Nelson) and with Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Watts). In high school, I had a female friend who hung around with me a lot and I had a huge crush on her. I never let her know of the crush for fear of losing her altogether. Also, I didn't live in the city where I went to school. That was basically like living on the other side of the tracks. To top it off, I even had my dad pushing me hard to go to college (which I did). One thing about seeing this movie on cable, DVD or VHSit is not the same as seeing it in a movie theater with an audience. Elias Koteas as "Duncan" the skinhead steals all the scenes he is in and makes you laugh hard. That laughter was further amplified by everyone else who laughed in the movie theater. However, Mary Stuart Masterson's heart wrenching emotion transfers very well on both the big screen and on the silver screen. In my opinion, she was the true star of the movie. Over twenty years later, I still enjoy watching this movie and consider it one of my top ten favorites. I highly recommend it.

    Some Kind of Wonderful was written and produced by John Hughes, the man who most people call the 80s king. His teen based movies did very well with audiences of all ages and are still hailed as some of the best movies of that decade. But then you get this movie, which by all accounts should be excellent, but when you look at the trite storyline and shallow characters you think "John Hughes wrote this?" Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 7/10 because, for some reason or other, this movie, with all of its unoriginality and basically second rate story, captures your attention and you find yourself watching it over and over again. The character Watts was perhaps the only refreshing thing in the film. Her blatant disdain for her friend Keith's interest in a preppy girl isn't subtle and isn't annoying. She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him. Mary Stuart Masterson did an impeccable job as the sexy tomboy best friend. Keith's character, although cute in his naive and unsure manner, isn't as likable as Watts; But this is masterfully done because you feel that his character shouldn't be as cool as Watts. You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in "The Breakfast Club" and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in "Pretty in Pink" and "Sixteen Candles." They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, "Yes, this is John Hughes."

    This is a film written by the late John Hughes. He has always had a talent for writing realistic and engaging characters as shown in many of his other films including The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, & Uncle Buck. All great films and with this one he pulls it off again. The story follows Keith (Eric Stoltz) as he tries to discover his place in the world dealing with his overbearing father who is desperate for him to go to college. Keith is infatuated by popular girl Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and he invites her on a date, she accepts and Keith along with help from his best friend, a tomboy called Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), plan the most amazing date. The cast including Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, Lea Thompson, Craig Sheffer, John Ashton & Elias Koteas is great and all bring something great to each character. The story is basic but it draws you in and doesn't let go. The scenes are beautifully shot and the soundtrack brings the film come to life. This is a really fun film with some great twists and fun characters. The standout character is the skinhead Duncan played by Elias Koteas who steals every scene he is in. John Hughes has created another under rated masterpiece. It is not as well known as Ferris Bueller's Day Off & Home Alone, but due to the more serious tone of the film, this is better. This is a great film, perfectly made and flawless. It's one I can watch time and time again.

    I was shocked to find out  don't ask me when, but I did realize it (possibly again) this viewing  that John Hughes did NOT direct Some Kind of Wonderful, a movie I've always labeled as my favorite John Hughes movie. Well, it still can be, thankfully. He did write it and produced it. So he did have his hands in some of the most important parts of the filmmaking process. Now, I do go up against many a Hughes fan of the 80s teen gen films because everyone's favorites always seem to be either Pretty in Pink or The Breakfast Club  both good, notwithstanding  and sometimes they even mention the excellent Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But, Some Kind of Wonderful, was just that: WONDERFUL, in every aspect. Music, acting, heart, dialogue, cast, comedy and romance. I viewed Pretty in Pink as a funny movie with a good heart  but not great. Breakfast Club was more about social commentary in the school. And Ferrisstrictly comedy with a dash of drama. It was my sister who introduced me to this movie (and Dirty Dancing) in the 1980s and I simply can't thank her enough. It made me a lifelong fan of both Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, though it's hard to see either in many more movies. I love the soundtrack from beginning to end, and it's one of the most listened to soundtracks in my life. And the dialogue (thank you, Mr. Hughes) is so good, I've used a lot of the lines multiple times in my life. Such as: (paraphrasing) "You can't judge a book by its coverbut you can tell how much it's gonna cost" and "I'm driving you crazy, and you're driving me crazy. And I'd rather not see you, and have you say good things about me, than see you and have you hate me. Cuz, I can't afford to have you hate me" Also, the romance was beautiful. Yeah, I understand the concepts in this movie are not entirely original, i.e. love triangle whereas one is completely blind to the one that loves him. But when the "so-called secret" is revealed, it's breathtaking. (Spoiler coming, sorry) And it doesn't hurt that the two who do get together all but walk off into the sunset (or is that moonlight?) leaving you believing this is forever. And that's my favorite type of ending where reality isn't at play. I really don't want to know what happens next. It's just enough for me to believe "they'll make it after all." The opposite also works here in this movie; I LOVED the beginning. What I refer to as "Watts at Play" is a great intro: She's playing the drums while the opening credits role and all the main characters are introduced. So well are both the drum solo by Watts (Masterson) and the first shots of the leads, that you really get a feeling of who's who and what status they play in both the high school they attend and in the movie as a hole. Brilliant. I'd like to believe the high school scenes hold up today, but its doubtful I would get others to agree with me, especially any young folk who would watch this for the first time in today's time. That's okay for several reasons: it is, in fact, based in 1987 as Watts directly points out in one scene. So, if the movie were based in a one-room school in 1865, it's a poor argument to say it doesn't hold true today. Also, I feel the themes  rebels, outcast, shy, popular, stuck up, money, disobedience, nagging parents, gossip, detention, talking backall still apply. Kids today. Whoa, let me continueKids today might be turned off by the dated nature of this film and I surely hope that doesn't happen. As I pointed out, I believe this to be as relevant today as it was 24 years ago. This is a simple movie of a boy, Keith (Stoltz) who is infatuated with taken Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and is blind to the true love that's right in front of him. Also, it helps Keith's plight that Amanda's boyfriend, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer  in a role I will forever and ONLY remember him in) is a cheatin' jerk. The story gets complicated with who's using who, who's loving who and who's supposed to be saving up for college. And there's a lot of room left over for extremely funny lines, comic tensions and deep insights into real people. I do like the script and the acting is pitch-perfect, even from the secondary roles  namely from Elias Koteas as, uh, "Skinhead." Another role I will define him as in my mind  even though I've seen him elsewhere, such as the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. But from all the things I loved about this film, such as the aforementioned great tunes, Watts (or Mary Stuart Masterson) is on my list of all-time favorite characters. She's tough yet insecure, hard though soft, smart but slacks, devoted however distant and both funny and sincere at the same time. She might have been overlooked for the Oscars or the casual viewer of this movie, but she steals every scene and shows the most depth of an already established fantastic cast. For someone 21 at the time, she acted her heart out and made an impact on me. Oh, and did I mention she plays a mean set of drums? I would love her in real lifeand it helps, she does kinda look like a guy. I'm going to sum up the above with: SEE IT. Don't miss one of the smaller Hughes (involved) films because everyone and their motherwait, probably mostly their motherslike Pretty in Pink more or think The Breakfast Club is superior. This 1980s relatively unknown film is a CLASSIC.

Doesn't anybody care he's going to end up in a hospital? Masterson is the best actor of the movie's trio, and though her mannerisms often bring to mind a twitchy Sandy Dennis, nothing compares to the girl's close-ups. HOT! Personally, I think the flick would be brilliant if Stoltz appeared as Rocky Dennis, thus upping the emotional stakes in a sort of sequel to "Mask".

    I saw this movie when it was released in theaters back in 1987. I had just turned 19 and had finished high school only six or so months before. God this movie made an impact on me! I loved it! It is so total 80's. What does every U.S. kid in high school seem to want? He/She wants to fit in. To be accepted. Yet others in high school can be so cruel. John Hughes certainly knew how to get into the heart of an 80's American teenager. I could relate so much with Eric Stoltz's character (Keith Nelson) and with Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Watts). In high school, I had a female friend who hung around with me a lot and I had a huge crush on her. I never let her know of the crush for fear of losing her altogether. Also, I didn't live in the city where I went to school. That was basically like living on the other side of the tracks. To top it off, I even had my dad pushing me hard to go to college (which I did). One thing about seeing this movie on cable, DVD or VHSit is not the same as seeing it in a movie theater with an audience. Elias Koteas as "Duncan" the skinhead steals all the scenes he is in and makes you laugh hard. That laughter was further amplified by everyone else who laughed in the movie theater. However, Mary Stuart Masterson's heart wrenching emotion transfers very well on both the big screen and on the silver screen. In my opinion, she was the true star of the movie. Over twenty years later, I still enjoy watching this movie and consider it one of my top ten favorites. I highly recommend it.
