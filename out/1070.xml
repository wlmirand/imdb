    This is a low budget film about making a low budget film by a guy who seems to always make low budget films. What this film reveals to us is not only the problems and the stress that comes about with all film making, but that which is generally connected with making low budget films. What sets low budget films apart from other normal films is that because there is a huge limit on funds available, other things are needed to draw the crowds, such as real characters and experimental filming techniques. This film begins in black and white, but when the filming begins, the film switches to colour. In the next section, it is the opposite, with the normal sequences being in colour and the filming sequences in black and white. Living in Oblivion is divided into three parts, and each of these parts a different scene is being filmed. The whole goal of this movie is that a scene in the movie is filmed, and Nick (Steve Buschemi), the director, seems to always run into problems when the filming begins. The way DiCillo makes the movie, which is very similar to what he did in Johnny Suede, leaves you wondering what is real and what is not. He is very clever with his dream sequences as they are indistinguishable from reality, except that everything ends up destroyed. Yet, the dream sequence in the film that is being made is the opposite, with smoke machines and dwarfs. The lead actors in the film are also important. One is a struggling actress who only did a shower scene in a Richard Geare movie. The famous actor is a complete snob and wants everything done his way, and he prances around acting as if he owned the entire movie. It seems that DiCillo is making a comment about actors who think that they make movies and without them the movie wouldn't exist. It is interesting that a Hollywood writer said that there is no such thing as a bankable product, and just because an actor is popular, doesn't mean that he is going to make millions from a movie. Living in Oblivion is a type of movie that I like because it focuses on characters and the relationships that cause problems. The director is not afraid to experiment, nor make comments about people, such as famous actors. Mostly, he tries to reveal to us what it really is like on a set of a low budget movies, and the problems that they face.

    Tom DiCillo's (yeah, never heard of him either) thinly veiled attack on (1) Brad Pitt and (2) Indie film-making is a movie about making movies joining much better films such as "Barton Fink" and, to a lesser extent, "The Player" in this sub-sub-subgenre. It follows the always corpse-like Steve Buscemi as a director just trying to film two scenes in a seemingly awful low-budget independent production that has the distinction of snaring a megastar who is trying to build cred played by Brad Pitt look (sorta)-alike James LeGros. The Pitt character (the comically named Chad Palomino) is pure satire of the spoiled star who believes their least inventive whim is pure genius while the others are fleshed out to the extent that we get a look into their interior lives, anxieties and to some degree hopes. There are extended dream sequences, some attempts at "Spinal Tap"-esque humor (and the smoke machine went crazy!!!!) and a whole lotta characters tossing F-bombs at one another (shocking!!!). Everyone on the set has slept with a least one other person, Buscemi's addled mom shows up and the whole mess tries way too hard to be either funny or poignant or insider hip or something. If you ever wanted to see Buscemi try to carry a film or if like to feel hip by picking a movie that makes fun of movies themselves you might enjoy this -- I didn't. If you want a movie about movie-making, try "Hooper", the 1978 Burt Reynolds vehicle about stuntmen making movies. Believe it or not, there was a (really brief) time when Burt Reynolds was so bankable that studios would sign a blank check and let he, Hal Needham, Dom Deluise, Mary Lou Henner, sometimes Sally Fields and random celebrities like quarterback Terry Bradshaw or drunk (may he rest in peace) Dean Martin just go out and wing it in front of the camera. "Hooper" is a complete mess but actually entertaining as opposed to tightly directed and produced but only conceptually entertaining.

    This is an Awesome Film with in a Film. Buschemi is very good playing the lead role as we usually see him playing cameo roles. If you are a film maker like myself I would recommend watching this film, other films similar to this such as The Independent, Bowfinger and the small indie film's American Movie and Le Fear hold weight in this genre, however Liing in Oblivion has to edge it for me and has it all when it comes to films in this genre, it also has a back story which makes it more interesting as both lead actors Catherine Keener and James LeGros have a fling and the atmosphere on set is intense. my rating for this movie is 8 out of 10.

    Having spent the better half of the last 7 years working on both sides of the camera, I can sympathize with filmmakers and actors. Most people have this mistaken notion that "All you have to do is push a button and act a little here and there." But that is not the case at all. Whenever the camera is rolling and the director calls "ACTION", practically anything could happen... and often does! What's so great about LIVING IN OBLIVION is that Tom DiCillo turns the camera around and shows us what really happens behind the scenes. And nothing is spared. We get to see the odd mix of nerves, ennui, exhaustion, desperation, disappointments, and surprises, deftly handled with a comedic touch. Steve Buscemi (who is no stranger to directing) gives his best performance as Nick Reve, the quirky director who tries to keep everything from falling apart. And if ever a struggling filmmaker needed some inspiration, this movie would grant it! For anyone thinking of making a movie, I'd highly recommend watching this movie and "American Movie" on a double bill!

    Small, low budget films hold a special place in many film goer's hearts. We embrace them as our own special offspring. It's an irrational attachment we have for them, like kidnapping our neighbor's child. But cinema, apparently, is some sort of expression of our collective desire to be acknowledged, to be contributing to the public conversation. That's a bizarre, absurd role to demand of independent films, of any film, but that's the weird world we've been born into, isn't it? The ignored, unnoticed independent film is often the container and conveyor of our most salient, real desires. Frustration and anxiety are palpable, ever present qualities of modern life, and low budget films should not be exempt. Tom DiCillo has incorporated these discomforting, disturbing qualities into his poignantly absurd film. The production of the film within the film is at the mercy of unpredictable, arbitrary forces, like malfunctioning smoke machines, incompetent crew members, emotionally distracted actors, and just plain bad luck. Nothing is as effortless and perfect as it is in the "real" movies. This revelation elevates this film into the realm of essential; essential for anyone who is considering making their own independent low budget film, and essential for any fan of quality non Studio, non mega budget films. That it can be so impossible just getting a single scene "into the can"  the expression for capturing on film a worthwhile moment  is a potent metaphor for all our own endeavors. We are continually assaulted with the infinite demands of our mundane lives but are so wiling to sacrifice so much of our precious time to the act of getting it just right, whatever "it" may be. We need to be succeeding at something, anything, in order to feel worthy. And maniacal persistence is the indispensable means to success. However, it's usually a non productive hobby, past time or diversion that occupies us so insistently. Living in Oblivion is a rare opportunity to examine this impulse of ours to perfect relatively minor, inconsequential things. The conceit of the film is that we, the audience, like to believe that we are above and beyond such tedious, temporal concerns, yet we are equally, undeniably fascinated by the intricacies of the "inner" film's creation. "How would I do it?" is a question that frames every scene. But our involvement is irrelevant. That's the paradox at this film's core. That's the ultimate message here, that we, the audience, are inconsequential. That might sound bleak and morose to some, but I found it deeply satisfying. I am not responsible, in the end, for this film's success. I am only watching. Tom DiCillo has earned a reputation as an iconoclast, as a rebel, as an anti establishment defender of the individual. I'm not sure just how justified is this reputation - he has lately directed arguably crappy TV such as Law and Order - but still, he proves himself a potent source of genuinely profound insights in this film. You will learn what it feels like to be an ambitious, hopeful, idealistic artist working in a crass, indifferent, commercial world. That's a rare treat. The fact that Steve Buschemi, Katherine Keener, and Dermot Mulroney are so wonderfully natural is proof that Dicillo has golden instincts. We are granted access to these artist's most transcendent talents. I've seen them all in many different, fantastic roles, but here they are at their absolute best, their most real. That's a quality that nearly all films aspire too, but so very few achieve. Enjoy this film for this commendable fact along with the knowledge that it's nearly impossible to make a film like this today or ever again. (David Lynch did it in 2006 with his Inland Empire which has been ignored by the general film going public. It's a monumentally original, powerful, revolutionary film experience. Charlie Kaufman also accomplished a tremendous feat of originality with his phenomenal Synecdoche, NY from 2008. Both films are subtle expressions of artistic desire in the face of a coldly indifferent, if not outright maliciously violent culture.)

    I stood this for 41:33---root canal is more bearable than this gruesomely predictable time- waster from the indie psycho ward. All the by-the-numbers indie elements are here: zero budget, non-existent production value, flaccid pace,"edgy" characters (=weirdos), cut-&-paste "script" (no more than a collection of notions about what a film *really* is)---in other words, the same old indie riff.*Yawn* They crank these things out, like sausages, for the tax break that these born-to-lose duds provide- --their only reason for being. These indie dogs have a liturgical quality---lovable losers struggling through life, make you laugh/make you cry, blase blase. Absolutely nothing new here. The inevitable Steve Buscemi--- hideously loathsome in the stomach-turning "Ghost World" (2001), is here doing his indie thing (=pre-psychotic nut-job) for the ten thousandth time. Next case. This is pure indie, to the bone: ad infinitum, ad nauseum, ad absurdum. There will always be a small hard-core audience for junk like this, just like the market for '70s TV sit-coms, banjo music, political "documentaries", etc. "Bad & The Beautiful" (1951) and "Le Mepris/Contempt" (1963) are the real-deal films about movie-making, made by pros who knew what they were doing---but for grown-up adults only. Indie-stoner characters will salivate over this, for sure---they're an easy sell. It's worth noting this pimple got SEVEN "awards". From whom, and for what ? "Citizen Kane" (1941) only got three.

    Place this in a time capsule and see how much future generations will relate to Nick and his adventures. The strength in this movie is the casting and just watch to see how the indie scene in the '90's could formulate this cast. Buscemi plays one of his most memorable characters in his facet (which is saying a lot for the King of Indies). Catherine Keener perfected her Catherine Keener-demeanor (if there ever was one) in this flick and gave a new purpose for Preparation H. Peter Dinklidge gives a deep concentrated monologue about the 'importance' of dwarfs in film. Dermont Mulrony rocks the s**t out of an eye patch and has some of the plays off of every actor so casually that it is characterization to the highest degree. And poor James LeGroes missing out on the Brad Pitt boat because he out-pits Pitt! Tom DiCillo was an indie master before this with his previous work with Jim Jarmusch but the fact that he never settled for the high road after this flick makes him miss his mark as a new Billy Wilde, and instead had to settle for being Tom DiCillo

    When this came out it was marketed as a slacker or Indie comedy, so I was especially careful to avoid it. Big mistake. I just saw this now out of a misguided sense of completism, and it's a great movie. Tom DiCillo is like one of the guys who tells your favourite joke, the one you have told hundreds of times, but in a way that people actually laugh at it. It actually IS an indie comedy about the making of a low-budget movie, but don't let that throw you off. This movie also proves the great comedic value of repetition. When that dwar-- ... erm, vertically disadvantaged person walks around Catherine Keener with his apple for the twentieth time, this otherwise trivial scene just cracks you up. In a way I'd advise you to NOT watch this movie after you have inhaled, the same way I'd advise you against mixing acid with zombie movies. It's all in the magic mixture of an excellent script, excellent actors (the smaller roles (no pun intended, but Tito is also great) as well as Keener and Buscemi) and excellent direction. Hollywood please take note, more is not needed for an intelligent and entertaining movie. I'd give 8 points but as this movie really surprised me and needs to be seen by more people I'll gerrymander it up to a gleaming 9.

    You're the director of a low budget film and all you have to do is get all the different disparate elements to come together and get everyone to peak and not screw up all at the same time, and then you're making a mother f*cking movie. Apart from on this day everything seems to be going wrong. Relationships are falling apart, actors aren't acting, stars aren't starring and the crew seem more intent on getting in front of the camera rather than staying behind it. In Tom Dicillo's perfect satire on the troublesome process of movie making, the comedy of errors that transpires is one of the funniest that has ever been put on celluloid, with Steve Buscemi flawless and hilarious as the director having a nightmare as events conspire to spoil his film. The dialogue is so damn good that it becomes the kind of quotable fare that just filters into your regular daily language. Dermot Mulroney and Catherine Keener are also excellent as the neurotic actress and art-house cameraman respectively. Whilst there is much dispute over which sequences is the best, for me, it's the last one filming the dream sequence, with the dwarf with an attitude problem who makes mini-me seem like an ewok on Valium. If it's at your video store rent it, if it's for sale buy it. It's well worth the purchase and will b a film that's a joy to watch more than once.

    Nick (Steve Buscemi) is directing a low-budget film called Living in Oblivion, that is having a lot of problems during the filming. When the crew is ready the actors can't remember their lines and when the actors are making the scene in a superb way the camera isn't filming. Things like that are even in Nick's dreams and in the dreams of his main actress, Nicole (Catherine Keener), so Nick must deal with the problems of making low-budget films. "Living in Oblivion", the second film written & directed by Tom DiCillo, is one of the most original films that i have ever seen and is an hilarious and strange low-budget comedy about low-budget film-making. The film is divide in three parts showing the dreams of Nick and Nicole and one real scene of Nick's film. But is all fun with this director and his bizarre crew dealing with a Hollywood star (James LeGros) who wants to change the film and with the mother of Nick (Laurel Thomby) who is interfering with the filming. The dreams are just how Nick and Nicole would love to deal with a problematic situation like that, Nick insulting everyone and Nicole ruining the Hollywood star and falling in love with Nick. But for me the most surrealistic sequence is actually the real one of the film with Nick's mother acting better than the real actors. Basically the plot is really simple, showing a lot of takes of the three different scenes but there is always a different detail for every single take and a different reaction of the great characters, you will be asking: now, what's next? what could f*ck more the film of Nick? The cast is just superb; for me this role ranks in Steve Buscemi's top five, and that's a really difficult decision because he is an amazing actor with many memorable characters like Mr. Pink, Donny or Seymor from "Reservoir Dogs", "The Big Lebowski" and "Ghost World". I really love this character that was based upon Buscemi's own experiences during his first attempts of making his debut film "Trees Lounge". The supporting cast is amazing too, with the lovely Catherine Keener as a not very famous actress who's major recognition was a shower scene in a Richard Gere film. James LeGros is really funny as Chad Palomino, the Hollywood star who works with Nick just because he think Nick was tight with Quentin Tarantino. And Dermot Mulroney as Wolf, the loyal camera man who is always supporting Nick. Conclusion: Tom DiCillo was used to this kind of situations due to the difficult filming of his debut film, in "Living in Oblivon" he creates an hilarious parody of low- budget films that all the cinema lovers must check. This film is one my personal favourites of the 90's and maybe ever and is a gem of low- budget film-making. 10 out of 10 DVD: this film is practically unknown in Mexico so i have to order this DVD. Is a single edition with some bonus like comments of Buscemi and interviews with DiCillo and Buscemi. In cases like this one, to can watch a film like this is just enough.

"How would I do it?" is a question that frames every scene. But our involvement is irrelevant. That's the paradox at this film's core. That's the ultimate message here, that we, the audience, are inconsequential. That might sound bleak and morose to some, but I found it deeply satisfying. I am not responsible, in the end, for this film's success. I am only watching. Tom DiCillo has earned a reputation as an iconoclast, as a rebel, as an anti establishment defender of the individual. I'm not sure just how justified is this reputation - he has lately directed arguably crappy TV such as Law and Order - but still, he proves himself a potent source of genuinely profound insights in this film. You will learn what it feels like to be an ambitious, hopeful, idealistic artist working in a crass, indifferent, commercial world. That's a rare treat. The fact that Steve Buschemi, Katherine Keener, and Dermot Mulroney are so wonderfully natural is proof that Dicillo has golden instincts. We are granted access to these artist's most transcendent talents. I've seen them all in many different, fantastic roles, but here they are at their absolute best, their most real. That's a quality that nearly all films aspire too, but so very few achieve. Enjoy this film for this commendable fact along with the knowledge that it's nearly impossible to make a film like this today or ever again. (David Lynch did it in 2006 with his Inland Empire which has been ignored by the general film going public. It's a monumentally original, powerful, revolutionary film experience. Charlie Kaufman also accomplished a tremendous feat of originality with his phenomenal Synecdoche, NY from 2008. Both films are subtle expressions of artistic desire in the face of a coldly indifferent, if not outright maliciously violent culture.)

    I stood this for 41:33---root canal is more bearable than this gruesomely predictable time- waster from the indie psycho ward. All the by-the-numbers indie elements are here: zero budget, non-existent production value, flaccid pace,"edgy" characters (=weirdos), cut-&-paste "script" (no more than a collection of notions about what a film *really* is)---in other words, the same old indie riff.*Yawn* They crank these things out, like sausages, for the tax break that these born-to-lose duds provide- --their only reason for being. These indie dogs have a liturgical quality---lovable losers struggling through life, make you laugh/make you cry, blase blase. Absolutely nothing new here. The inevitable Steve Buscemi--- hideously loathsome in the stomach-turning "Ghost World" (2001), is here doing his indie thing (=pre-psychotic nut-job) for the ten thousandth time. Next case. This is pure indie, to the bone: ad infinitum, ad nauseum, ad absurdum. There will always be a small hard-core audience for junk like this, just like the market for '70s TV sit-coms, banjo music, political "documentaries", etc. "Bad & The Beautiful" (1951) and "Le Mepris/Contempt" (1963) are the real-deal films about movie-making, made by pros who knew what they were doing---but for grown-up adults only. Indie-stoner characters will salivate over this, for sure---they're an easy sell. It's worth noting this pimple got SEVEN "awards". From whom, and for what ? "Citizen Kane" (1941) only got three.

    Place this in a time capsule and see how much future generations will relate to Nick and his adventures. The strength in this movie is the casting and just watch to see how the indie scene in the '90's could formulate this cast. Buscemi plays one of his most memorable characters in his facet (which is saying a lot for the King of Indies). Catherine Keener perfected her Catherine Keener-demeanor (if there ever was one) in this flick and gave a new purpose for Preparation H. Peter Dinklidge gives a deep concentrated monologue about the 'importance' of dwarfs in film. Dermont Mulrony rocks the s**t out of an eye patch and has some of the plays off of every actor so casually that it is characterization to the highest degree. And poor James LeGroes missing out on the Brad Pitt boat because he out-pits Pitt! Tom DiCillo was an indie master before this with his previous work with Jim Jarmusch but the fact that he never settled for the high road after this flick makes him miss his mark as a new Billy Wilde, and instead had to settle for being Tom DiCillo

    When this came out it was marketed as a slacker or Indie comedy, so I was especially careful to avoid it. Big mistake. I just saw this now out of a misguided sense of completism, and it's a great movie. Tom DiCillo is like one of the guys who tells your favourite joke, the one you have told hundreds of times, but in a way that people actually laugh at it. It actually IS an indie comedy about the making of a low-budget movie, but don't let that throw you off. This movie also proves the great comedic value of repetition. When that dwar-- ... erm, vertically disadvantaged person walks around Catherine Keener with his apple for the twentieth time, this otherwise trivial scene just cracks you up. In a way I'd advise you to NOT watch this movie after you have inhaled, the same way I'd advise you against mixing acid with zombie movies. It's all in the magic mixture of an excellent script, excellent actors (the smaller roles (no pun intended, but Tito is also great) as well as Keener and Buscemi) and excellent direction. Hollywood please take note, more is not needed for an intelligent and entertaining movie. I'd give 8 points but as this movie really surprised me and needs to be seen by more people I'll gerrymander it up to a gleaming 9.

    You're the director of a low budget film and all you have to do is get all the different disparate elements to come together and get everyone to peak and not screw up all at the same time, and then you're making a mother f*cking movie. Apart from on this day everything seems to be going wrong. Relationships are falling apart, actors aren't acting, stars aren't starring and the crew seem more intent on getting in front of the camera rather than staying behind it. In Tom Dicillo's perfect satire on the troublesome process of movie making, the comedy of errors that transpires is one of the funniest that has ever been put on celluloid, with Steve Buscemi flawless and hilarious as the director having a nightmare as events conspire to spoil his film. The dialogue is so damn good that it becomes the kind of quotable fare that just filters into your regular daily language. Dermot Mulroney and Catherine Keener are also excellent as the neurotic actress and art-house cameraman respectively. Whilst there is much dispute over which sequences is the best, for me, it's the last one filming the dream sequence, with the dwarf with an attitude problem who makes mini-me seem like an ewok on Valium. If it's at your video store rent it, if it's for sale buy it. It's well worth the purchase and will b a film that's a joy to watch more than once.

    Nick (Steve Buscemi) is directing a low-budget film called Living in Oblivion, that is having a lot of problems during the filming. When the crew is ready the actors can't remember their lines and when the actors are making the scene in a superb way the camera isn't filming. Things like that are even in Nick's dreams and in the dreams of his main actress, Nicole (Catherine Keener), so Nick must deal with the problems of making low-budget films. "Living in Oblivion", the second film written & directed by Tom DiCillo, is one of the most original films that i have ever seen and is an hilarious and strange low-budget comedy about low-budget film-making. The film is divide in three parts showing the dreams of Nick and Nicole and one real scene of Nick's film. But is all fun with this director and his bizarre crew dealing with a Hollywood star (James LeGros) who wants to change the film and with the mother of Nick (Laurel Thomby) who is interfering with the filming. The dreams are just how Nick and Nicole would love to deal with a problematic situation like that, Nick insulting everyone and Nicole ruining the Hollywood star and falling in love with Nick. But for me the most surrealistic sequence is actually the real one of the film with Nick's mother acting better than the real actors. Basically the plot is really simple, showing a lot of takes of the three different scenes but there is always a different detail for every single take and a different reaction of the great characters, you will be asking: now, what's next? what could f*ck more the film of Nick? The cast is just superb; for me this role ranks in Steve Buscemi's top five, and that's a really difficult decision because he is an amazing actor with many memorable characters like Mr. Pink, Donny or Seymor from "Reservoir Dogs", "The Big Lebowski" and "Ghost World". I really love this character that was based upon Buscemi's own experiences during his first attempts of making his debut film "Trees Lounge". The supporting cast is amazing too, with the lovely Catherine Keener as a not very famous actress who's major recognition was a shower scene in a Richard Gere film. James LeGros is really funny as Chad Palomino, the Hollywood star who works with Nick just because he think Nick was tight with Quentin Tarantino. And Dermot Mulroney as Wolf, the loyal camera man who is always supporting Nick. Conclusion: Tom DiCillo was used to this kind of situations due to the difficult filming of his debut film, in "Living in Oblivon" he creates an hilarious parody of low- budget films that all the cinema lovers must check. This film is one my personal favourites of the 90's and maybe ever and is a gem of low- budget film-making. 10 out of 10 DVD: this film is practically unknown in Mexico so i have to order this DVD. Is a single edition with some bonus like comments of Buscemi and interviews with DiCillo and Buscemi. In cases like this one, to can watch a film like this is just enough.

    A Low Budget Movie About Making a Low Budget Movie

    This is a low budget film about making a low budget film by a guy who seems to always make low budget films. What this film reveals to us is not only the problems and the stress that comes about with all film making, but that which is generally connected with making low budget films. What sets low budget films apart from other normal films is that because there is a huge limit on funds available, other things are needed to draw the crowds, such as real characters and experimental filming techniques. This film begins in black and white, but when the filming begins, the film switches to colour. In the next section, it is the opposite, with the normal sequences being in colour and the filming sequences in black and white. Living in Oblivion is divided into three parts, and each of these parts a different scene is being filmed. The whole goal of this movie is that a scene in the movie is filmed, and Nick (Steve Buschemi), the director, seems to always run into problems when the filming begins. The way DiCillo makes the movie, which is very similar to what he did in Johnny Suede, leaves you wondering what is real and what is not. He is very clever with his dream sequences as they are indistinguishable from reality, except that everything ends up destroyed. Yet, the dream sequence in the film that is being made is the opposite, with smoke machines and dwarfs. The lead actors in the film are also important. One is a struggling actress who only did a shower scene in a Richard Geare movie. The famous actor is a complete snob and wants everything done his way, and he prances around acting as if he owned the entire movie. It seems that DiCillo is making a comment about actors who think that they make movies and without them the movie wouldn't exist. It is interesting that a Hollywood writer said that there is no such thing as a bankable product, and just because an actor is popular, doesn't mean that he is going to make millions from a movie. Living in Oblivion is a type of movie that I like because it focuses on characters and the relationships that cause problems. The director is not afraid to experiment, nor make comments about people, such as famous actors. Mostly, he tries to reveal to us what it really is like on a set of a low budget movies, and the problems that they face.

    Tom DiCillo's (yeah, never heard of him either) thinly veiled attack on (1) Brad Pitt and (2) Indie film-making is a movie about making movies joining much better films such as "Barton Fink" and, to a lesser extent, "The Player" in this sub-sub-subgenre. It follows the always corpse-like Steve Buscemi as a director just trying to film two scenes in a seemingly awful low-budget independent production that has the distinction of snaring a megastar who is trying to build cred played by Brad Pitt look (sorta)-alike James LeGros. The Pitt character (the comically named Chad Palomino) is pure satire of the spoiled star who believes their least inventive whim is pure genius while the others are fleshed out to the extent that we get a look into their interior lives, anxieties and to some degree hopes. There are extended dream sequences, some attempts at "Spinal Tap"-esque humor (and the smoke machine went crazy!!!!) and a whole lotta characters tossing F-bombs at one another (shocking!!!). Everyone on the set has slept with a least one other person, Buscemi's addled mom shows up and the whole mess tries way too hard to be either funny or poignant or insider hip or something. If you ever wanted to see Buscemi try to carry a film or if like to feel hip by picking a movie that makes fun of movies themselves you might enjoy this -- I didn't. If you want a movie about movie-making, try "Hooper", the 1978 Burt Reynolds vehicle about stuntmen making movies. Believe it or not, there was a (really brief) time when Burt Reynolds was so bankable that studios would sign a blank check and let he, Hal Needham, Dom Deluise, Mary Lou Henner, sometimes Sally Fields and random celebrities like quarterback Terry Bradshaw or drunk (may he rest in peace) Dean Martin just go out and wing it in front of the camera. "Hooper" is a complete mess but actually entertaining as opposed to tightly directed and produced but only conceptually entertaining.

    This is an Awesome Film with in a Film. Buschemi is very good playing the lead role as we usually see him playing cameo roles. If you are a film maker like myself I would recommend watching this film, other films similar to this such as The Independent, Bowfinger and the small indie film's American Movie and Le Fear hold weight in this genre, however Liing in Oblivion has to edge it for me and has it all when it comes to films in this genre, it also has a back story which makes it more interesting as both lead actors Catherine Keener and James LeGros have a fling and the atmosphere on set is intense. my rating for this movie is 8 out of 10.

    Having spent the better half of the last 7 years working on both sides of the camera, I can sympathize with filmmakers and actors. Most people have this mistaken notion that "All you have to do is push a button and act a little here and there." But that is not the case at all. Whenever the camera is rolling and the director calls "ACTION", practically anything could happen... and often does! What's so great about LIVING IN OBLIVION is that Tom DiCillo turns the camera around and shows us what really happens behind the scenes. And nothing is spared. We get to see the odd mix of nerves, ennui, exhaustion, desperation, disappointments, and surprises, deftly handled with a comedic touch. Steve Buscemi (who is no stranger to directing) gives his best performance as Nick Reve, the quirky director who tries to keep everything from falling apart. And if ever a struggling filmmaker needed some inspiration, this movie would grant it! For anyone thinking of making a movie, I'd highly recommend watching this movie and "American Movie" on a double bill!

    Small, low budget films hold a special place in many film goer's hearts. We embrace them as our own special offspring. It's an irrational attachment we have for them, like kidnapping our neighbor's child. But cinema, apparently, is some sort of expression of our collective desire to be acknowledged, to be contributing to the public conversation. That's a bizarre, absurd role to demand of independent films, of any film, but that's the weird world we've been born into, isn't it? The ignored, unnoticed independent film is often the container and conveyor of our most salient, real desires. Frustration and anxiety are palpable, ever present qualities of modern life, and low budget films should not be exempt. Tom DiCillo has incorporated these discomforting, disturbing qualities into his poignantly absurd film. The production of the film within the film is at the mercy of unpredictable, arbitrary forces, like malfunctioning smoke machines, incompetent crew members, emotionally distracted actors, and just plain bad luck. Nothing is as effortless and perfect as it is in the "real" movies. This revelation elevates this film into the realm of essential; essential for anyone who is considering making their own independent low budget film, and essential for any fan of quality non Studio, non mega budget films. That it can be so impossible just getting a single scene "into the can"  the expression for capturing on film a worthwhile moment  is a potent metaphor for all our own endeavors. We are continually assaulted with the infinite demands of our mundane lives but are so wiling to sacrifice so much of our precious time to the act of getting it just right, whatever "it" may be. We need to be succeeding at something, anything, in order to feel worthy. And maniacal persistence is the indispensable means to success. However, it's usually a non productive hobby, past time or diversion that occupies us so insistently. Living in Oblivion is a rare opportunity to examine this impulse of ours to perfect relatively minor, inconsequential things. The conceit of the film is that we, the audience, like to believe that we are above and beyond such tedious, temporal concerns, yet we are equally, undeniably fascinated by the intricacies of the "inner" film's creation. "How would I do it?" is a question that frames every scene. But our involvement is irrelevant. That's the paradox at this film's core. That's the ultimate message here, that we, the audience, are inconsequential. That might sound bleak and morose to some, but I found it deeply satisfying. I am not responsible, in the end, for this film's success. I am only watching. Tom DiCillo has earned a reputation as an iconoclast, as a rebel, as an anti establishment defender of the individual.

And Dermot Mulroney as Wolf, the loyal camera man who is always supporting Nick. Conclusion: Tom DiCillo was used to this kind of situations due to the difficult filming of his debut film, in "Living in Oblivon" he creates an hilarious parody of low- budget films that all the cinema lovers must check. This film is one my personal favourites of the 90's and maybe ever and is a gem of low- budget film-making. 10 out of 10 DVD: this film is practically unknown in Mexico so i have to order this DVD. Is a single edition with some bonus like comments of Buscemi and interviews with DiCillo and Buscemi. In cases like this one, to can watch a film like this is just enough.

    A Low Budget Movie About Making a Low Budget Movie

    This is a low budget film about making a low budget film by a guy who seems to always make low budget films. What this film reveals to us is not only the problems and the stress that comes about with all film making, but that which is generally connected with making low budget films. What sets low budget films apart from other normal films is that because there is a huge limit on funds available, other things are needed to draw the crowds, such as real characters and experimental filming techniques. This film begins in black and white, but when the filming begins, the film switches to colour. In the next section, it is the opposite, with the normal sequences being in colour and the filming sequences in black and white. Living in Oblivion is divided into three parts, and each of these parts a different scene is being filmed. The whole goal of this movie is that a scene in the movie is filmed, and Nick (Steve Buschemi), the director, seems to always run into problems when the filming begins. The way DiCillo makes the movie, which is very similar to what he did in Johnny Suede, leaves you wondering what is real and what is not. He is very clever with his dream sequences as they are indistinguishable from reality, except that everything ends up destroyed. Yet, the dream sequence in the film that is being made is the opposite, with smoke machines and dwarfs. The lead actors in the film are also important. One is a struggling actress who only did a shower scene in a Richard Geare movie. The famous actor is a complete snob and wants everything done his way, and he prances around acting as if he owned the entire movie. It seems that DiCillo is making a comment about actors who think that they make movies and without them the movie wouldn't exist. It is interesting that a Hollywood writer said that there is no such thing as a bankable product, and just because an actor is popular, doesn't mean that he is going to make millions from a movie. Living in Oblivion is a type of movie that I like because it focuses on characters and the relationships that cause problems. The director is not afraid to experiment, nor make comments about people, such as famous actors. Mostly, he tries to reveal to us what it really is like on a set of a low budget movies, and the problems that they face.

    Tom DiCillo's (yeah, never heard of him either) thinly veiled attack on (1) Brad Pitt and (2) Indie film-making is a movie about making movies joining much better films such as "Barton Fink" and, to a lesser extent, "The Player" in this sub-sub-subgenre. It follows the always corpse-like Steve Buscemi as a director just trying to film two scenes in a seemingly awful low-budget independent production that has the distinction of snaring a megastar who is trying to build cred played by Brad Pitt look (sorta)-alike James LeGros. The Pitt character (the comically named Chad Palomino) is pure satire of the spoiled star who believes their least inventive whim is pure genius while the others are fleshed out to the extent that we get a look into their interior lives, anxieties and to some degree hopes. There are extended dream sequences, some attempts at "Spinal Tap"-esque humor (and the smoke machine went crazy!!!!) and a whole lotta characters tossing F-bombs at one another (shocking!!!). Everyone on the set has slept with a least one other person, Buscemi's addled mom shows up and the whole mess tries way too hard to be either funny or poignant or insider hip or something. If you ever wanted to see Buscemi try to carry a film or if like to feel hip by picking a movie that makes fun of movies themselves you might enjoy this -- I didn't. If you want a movie about movie-making, try "Hooper", the 1978 Burt Reynolds vehicle about stuntmen making movies. Believe it or not, there was a (really brief) time when Burt Reynolds was so bankable that studios would sign a blank check and let he, Hal Needham, Dom Deluise, Mary Lou Henner, sometimes Sally Fields and random celebrities like quarterback Terry Bradshaw or drunk (may he rest in peace) Dean Martin just go out and wing it in front of the camera. "Hooper" is a complete mess but actually entertaining as opposed to tightly directed and produced but only conceptually entertaining.

    This is an Awesome Film with in a Film. Buschemi is very good playing the lead role as we usually see him playing cameo roles. If you are a film maker like myself I would recommend watching this film, other films similar to this such as The Independent, Bowfinger and the small indie film's American Movie and Le Fear hold weight in this genre, however Liing in Oblivion has to edge it for me and has it all when it comes to films in this genre, it also has a back story which makes it more interesting as both lead actors Catherine Keener and James LeGros have a fling and the atmosphere on set is intense. my rating for this movie is 8 out of 10.

    Having spent the better half of the last 7 years working on both sides of the camera, I can sympathize with filmmakers and actors. Most people have this mistaken notion that "All you have to do is push a button and act a little here and there." But that is not the case at all. Whenever the camera is rolling and the director calls "ACTION", practically anything could happen... and often does! What's so great about LIVING IN OBLIVION is that Tom DiCillo turns the camera around and shows us what really happens behind the scenes. And nothing is spared. We get to see the odd mix of nerves, ennui, exhaustion, desperation, disappointments, and surprises, deftly handled with a comedic touch. Steve Buscemi (who is no stranger to directing) gives his best performance as Nick Reve, the quirky director who tries to keep everything from falling apart. And if ever a struggling filmmaker needed some inspiration, this movie would grant it! For anyone thinking of making a movie, I'd highly recommend watching this movie and "American Movie" on a double bill!

    Small, low budget films hold a special place in many film goer's hearts. We embrace them as our own special offspring. It's an irrational attachment we have for them, like kidnapping our neighbor's child. But cinema, apparently, is some sort of expression of our collective desire to be acknowledged, to be contributing to the public conversation. That's a bizarre, absurd role to demand of independent films, of any film, but that's the weird world we've been born into, isn't it? The ignored, unnoticed independent film is often the container and conveyor of our most salient, real desires. Frustration and anxiety are palpable, ever present qualities of modern life, and low budget films should not be exempt. Tom DiCillo has incorporated these discomforting, disturbing qualities into his poignantly absurd film. The production of the film within the film is at the mercy of unpredictable, arbitrary forces, like malfunctioning smoke machines, incompetent crew members, emotionally distracted actors, and just plain bad luck. Nothing is as effortless and perfect as it is in the "real" movies. This revelation elevates this film into the realm of essential; essential for anyone who is considering making their own independent low budget film, and essential for any fan of quality non Studio, non mega budget films. That it can be so impossible just getting a single scene "into the can"  the expression for capturing on film a worthwhile moment  is a potent metaphor for all our own endeavors. We are continually assaulted with the infinite demands of our mundane lives but are so wiling to sacrifice so much of our precious time to the act of getting it just right, whatever "it" may be. We need to be succeeding at something, anything, in order to feel worthy. And maniacal persistence is the indispensable means to success. However, it's usually a non productive hobby, past time or diversion that occupies us so insistently. Living in Oblivion is a rare opportunity to examine this impulse of ours to perfect relatively minor, inconsequential things. The conceit of the film is that we, the audience, like to believe that we are above and beyond such tedious, temporal concerns, yet we are equally, undeniably fascinated by the intricacies of the "inner" film's creation. "How would I do it?" is a question that frames every scene. But our involvement is irrelevant. That's the paradox at this film's core. That's the ultimate message here, that we, the audience, are inconsequential. That might sound bleak and morose to some, but I found it deeply satisfying. I am not responsible, in the end, for this film's success. I am only watching. Tom DiCillo has earned a reputation as an iconoclast, as a rebel, as an anti establishment defender of the individual. I'm not sure just how justified is this reputation - he has lately directed arguably crappy TV such as Law and Order - but still, he proves himself a potent source of genuinely profound insights in this film. You will learn what it feels like to be an ambitious, hopeful, idealistic artist working in a crass, indifferent, commercial world. That's a rare treat. The fact that Steve Buschemi, Katherine Keener, and Dermot Mulroney are so wonderfully natural is proof that Dicillo has golden instincts. We are granted access to these artist's most transcendent talents. I've seen them all in many different, fantastic roles, but here they are at their absolute best, their most real. That's a quality that nearly all films aspire too, but so very few achieve. Enjoy this film for this commendable fact along with the knowledge that it's nearly impossible to make a film like this today or ever again. (David Lynch did it in 2006 with his Inland Empire which has been ignored by the general film going public. It's a monumentally original, powerful, revolutionary film experience. Charlie Kaufman also accomplished a tremendous feat of originality with his phenomenal Synecdoche, NY from 2008. Both films are subtle expressions of artistic desire in the face of a coldly indifferent, if not outright maliciously violent culture.)

    I stood this for 41:33---root canal is more bearable than this gruesomely predictable time- waster from the indie psycho ward. All the by-the-numbers indie elements are here: zero budget, non-existent production value, flaccid pace,"edgy" characters (=weirdos), cut-&-paste "script" (no more than a collection of notions about what a film *really* is)---in other words, the same old indie riff.*Yawn* They crank these things out, like sausages, for the tax break that these born-to-lose duds provide- --their only reason for being. These indie dogs have a liturgical quality---lovable losers struggling through life, make you laugh/make you cry, blase blase. Absolutely nothing new here. The inevitable Steve Buscemi--- hideously loathsome in the stomach-turning "Ghost World" (2001), is here doing his indie thing (=pre-psychotic nut-job) for the ten thousandth time. Next case. This is pure indie, to the bone: ad infinitum, ad nauseum, ad absurdum. There will always be a small hard-core audience for junk like this, just like the market for '70s TV sit-coms, banjo music, political "documentaries", etc. "Bad & The Beautiful" (1951) and "Le Mepris/Contempt" (1963) are the real-deal films about movie-making, made by pros who knew what they were doing---but for grown-up adults only. Indie-stoner characters will salivate over this, for sure---they're an easy sell. It's worth noting this pimple got SEVEN "awards". From whom, and for what ? "Citizen Kane" (1941) only got three.

    Place this in a time capsule and see how much future generations will relate to Nick and his adventures. The strength in this movie is the casting and just watch to see how the indie scene in the '90's could formulate this cast. Buscemi plays one of his most memorable characters in his facet (which is saying a lot for the King of Indies). Catherine Keener perfected her Catherine Keener-demeanor (if there ever was one) in this flick and gave a new purpose for Preparation H. Peter Dinklidge gives a deep concentrated monologue about the 'importance' of dwarfs in film. Dermont Mulrony rocks the s**t out of an eye patch and has some of the plays off of every actor so casually that it is characterization to the highest degree. And poor James LeGroes missing out on the Brad Pitt boat because he out-pits Pitt! Tom DiCillo was an indie master before this with his previous work with Jim Jarmusch but the fact that he never settled for the high road after this flick makes him miss his mark as a new Billy Wilde, and instead had to settle for being Tom DiCillo

    When this came out it was marketed as a slacker or Indie comedy, so I was especially careful to avoid it. Big mistake. I just saw this now out of a misguided sense of completism, and it's a great movie. Tom DiCillo is like one of the guys who tells your favourite joke, the one you have told hundreds of times, but in a way that people actually laugh at it. It actually IS an indie comedy about the making of a low-budget movie, but don't let that throw you off. This movie also proves the great comedic value of repetition. When that dwar-- ... erm, vertically disadvantaged person walks around Catherine Keener with his apple for the twentieth time, this otherwise trivial scene just cracks you up. In a way I'd advise you to NOT watch this movie after you have inhaled, the same way I'd advise you against mixing acid with zombie movies. It's all in the magic mixture of an excellent script, excellent actors (the smaller roles (no pun intended, but Tito is also great) as well as Keener and Buscemi) and excellent direction. Hollywood please take note, more is not needed for an intelligent and entertaining movie. I'd give 8 points but as this movie really surprised me and needs to be seen by more people I'll gerrymander it up to a gleaming 9.

    You're the director of a low budget film and all you have to do is get all the different disparate elements to come together and get everyone to peak and not screw up all at the same time, and then you're making a mother f*cking movie. Apart from on this day everything seems to be going wrong. Relationships are falling apart, actors aren't acting, stars aren't starring and the crew seem more intent on getting in front of the camera rather than staying behind it. In Tom Dicillo's perfect satire on the troublesome process of movie making, the comedy of errors that transpires is one of the funniest that has ever been put on celluloid, with Steve Buscemi flawless and hilarious as the director having a nightmare as events conspire to spoil his film. The dialogue is so damn good that it becomes the kind of quotable fare that just filters into your regular daily language. Dermot Mulroney and Catherine Keener are also excellent as the neurotic actress and art-house cameraman respectively. Whilst there is much dispute over which sequences is the best, for me, it's the last one filming the dream sequence, with the dwarf with an attitude problem who makes mini-me seem like an ewok on Valium. If it's at your video store rent it, if it's for sale buy it. It's well worth the purchase and will b a film that's a joy to watch more than once.

    Nick (Steve Buscemi) is directing a low-budget film called Living in Oblivion, that is having a lot of problems during the filming. When the crew is ready the actors can't remember their lines and when the actors are making the scene in a superb way the camera isn't filming. Things like that are even in Nick's dreams and in the dreams of his main actress, Nicole (Catherine Keener), so Nick must deal with the problems of making low-budget films. "Living in Oblivion", the second film written & directed by Tom DiCillo, is one of the most original films that i have ever seen and is an hilarious and strange low-budget comedy about low-budget film-making. The film is divide in three parts showing the dreams of Nick and Nicole and one real scene of Nick's film. But is all fun with this director and his bizarre crew dealing with a Hollywood star (James LeGros) who wants to change the film and with the mother of Nick (Laurel Thomby) who is interfering with the filming. The dreams are just how Nick and Nicole would love to deal with a problematic situation like that, Nick insulting everyone and Nicole ruining the Hollywood star and falling in love with Nick. But for me the most surrealistic sequence is actually the real one of the film with Nick's mother acting better than the real actors. Basically the plot is really simple, showing a lot of takes of the three different scenes but there is always a different detail for every single take and a different reaction of the great characters, you will be asking: now, what's next? what could f*ck more the film of Nick? The cast is just superb; for me this role ranks in Steve Buscemi's top five, and that's a really difficult decision because he is an amazing actor with many memorable characters like Mr. Pink, Donny or Seymor from "Reservoir Dogs", "The Big Lebowski" and "Ghost World". I really love this character that was based upon Buscemi's own experiences during his first attempts of making his debut film "Trees Lounge". The supporting cast is amazing too, with the lovely Catherine Keener as a not very famous actress who's major recognition was a shower scene in a Richard Gere film. James LeGros is really funny as Chad Palomino, the Hollywood star who works with Nick just because he think Nick was tight with Quentin Tarantino. And Dermot Mulroney as Wolf, the loyal camera man who is always supporting Nick. Conclusion: Tom DiCillo was used to this kind of situations due to the difficult filming of his debut film, in "Living in Oblivon" he creates an hilarious parody of low- budget films that all the cinema lovers must check. This film is one my personal favourites of the 90's and maybe ever and is a gem of low- budget film-making. 10 out of 10 DVD: this film is practically unknown in Mexico so i have to order this DVD. Is a single edition with some bonus like comments of Buscemi and interviews with DiCillo and Buscemi. In cases like this one, to can watch a film like this is just enough.

We are granted access to these artist's most transcendent talents. I've seen them all in many different, fantastic roles, but here they are at their absolute best, their most real. That's a quality that nearly all films aspire too, but so very few achieve. Enjoy this film for this commendable fact along with the knowledge that it's nearly impossible to make a film like this today or ever again. (David Lynch did it in 2006 with his Inland Empire which has been ignored by the general film going public. It's a monumentally original, powerful, revolutionary film experience. Charlie Kaufman also accomplished a tremendous feat of originality with his phenomenal Synecdoche, NY from 2008. Both films are subtle expressions of artistic desire in the face of a coldly indifferent, if not outright maliciously violent culture.)

    I stood this for 41:33---root canal is more bearable than this gruesomely predictable time- waster from the indie psycho ward. All the by-the-numbers indie elements are here: zero budget, non-existent production value, flaccid pace,"edgy" characters (=weirdos), cut-&-paste "script" (no more than a collection of notions about what a film *really* is)---in other words, the same old indie riff.*Yawn* They crank these things out, like sausages, for the tax break that these born-to-lose duds provide- --their only reason for being. These indie dogs have a liturgical quality---lovable losers struggling through life, make you laugh/make you cry, blase blase. Absolutely nothing new here. The inevitable Steve Buscemi--- hideously loathsome in the stomach-turning "Ghost World" (2001), is here doing his indie thing (=pre-psychotic nut-job) for the ten thousandth time. Next case. This is pure indie, to the bone: ad infinitum, ad nauseum, ad absurdum. There will always be a small hard-core audience for junk like this, just like the market for '70s TV sit-coms, banjo music, political "documentaries", etc. "Bad & The Beautiful" (1951) and "Le Mepris/Contempt" (1963) are the real-deal films about movie-making, made by pros who knew what they were doing---but for grown-up adults only. Indie-stoner characters will salivate over this, for sure---they're an easy sell. It's worth noting this pimple got SEVEN "awards". From whom, and for what ? "Citizen Kane" (1941) only got three.

    Place this in a time capsule and see how much future generations will relate to Nick and his adventures. The strength in this movie is the casting and just watch to see how the indie scene in the '90's could formulate this cast. Buscemi plays one of his most memorable characters in his facet (which is saying a lot for the King of Indies). Catherine Keener perfected her Catherine Keener-demeanor (if there ever was one) in this flick and gave a new purpose for Preparation H. Peter Dinklidge gives a deep concentrated monologue about the 'importance' of dwarfs in film. Dermont Mulrony rocks the s**t out of an eye patch and has some of the plays off of every actor so casually that it is characterization to the highest degree. And poor James LeGroes missing out on the Brad Pitt boat because he out-pits Pitt! Tom DiCillo was an indie master before this with his previous work with Jim Jarmusch but the fact that he never settled for the high road after this flick makes him miss his mark as a new Billy Wilde, and instead had to settle for being Tom DiCillo

    When this came out it was marketed as a slacker or Indie comedy, so I was especially careful to avoid it. Big mistake. I just saw this now out of a misguided sense of completism, and it's a great movie. Tom DiCillo is like one of the guys who tells your favourite joke, the one you have told hundreds of times, but in a way that people actually laugh at it. It actually IS an indie comedy about the making of a low-budget movie, but don't let that throw you off. This movie also proves the great comedic value of repetition. When that dwar-- ... erm, vertically disadvantaged person walks around Catherine Keener with his apple for the twentieth time, this otherwise trivial scene just cracks you up. In a way I'd advise you to NOT watch this movie after you have inhaled, the same way I'd advise you against mixing acid with zombie movies. It's all in the magic mixture of an excellent script, excellent actors (the smaller roles (no pun intended, but Tito is also great) as well as Keener and Buscemi) and excellent direction. Hollywood please take note, more is not needed for an intelligent and entertaining movie. I'd give 8 points but as this movie really surprised me and needs to be seen by more people I'll gerrymander it up to a gleaming 9.

    You're the director of a low budget film and all you have to do is get all the different disparate elements to come together and get everyone to peak and not screw up all at the same time, and then you're making a mother f*cking movie. Apart from on this day everything seems to be going wrong. Relationships are falling apart, actors aren't acting, stars aren't starring and the crew seem more intent on getting in front of the camera rather than staying behind it. In Tom Dicillo's perfect satire on the troublesome process of movie making, the comedy of errors that transpires is one of the funniest that has ever been put on celluloid, with Steve Buscemi flawless and hilarious as the director having a nightmare as events conspire to spoil his film. The dialogue is so damn good that it becomes the kind of quotable fare that just filters into your regular daily language. Dermot Mulroney and Catherine Keener are also excellent as the neurotic actress and art-house cameraman respectively. Whilst there is much dispute over which sequences is the best, for me, it's the last one filming the dream sequence, with the dwarf with an attitude problem who makes mini-me seem like an ewok on Valium. If it's at your video store rent it, if it's for sale buy it. It's well worth the purchase and will b a film that's a joy to watch more than once.

    Nick (Steve Buscemi) is directing a low-budget film called Living in Oblivion, that is having a lot of problems during the filming. When the crew is ready the actors can't remember their lines and when the actors are making the scene in a superb way the camera isn't filming. Things like that are even in Nick's dreams and in the dreams of his main actress, Nicole (Catherine Keener), so Nick must deal with the problems of making low-budget films. "Living in Oblivion", the second film written & directed by Tom DiCillo, is one of the most original films that i have ever seen and is an hilarious and strange low-budget comedy about low-budget film-making. The film is divide in three parts showing the dreams of Nick and Nicole and one real scene of Nick's film. But is all fun with this director and his bizarre crew dealing with a Hollywood star (James LeGros) who wants to change the film and with the mother of Nick (Laurel Thomby) who is interfering with the filming. The dreams are just how Nick and Nicole would love to deal with a problematic situation like that, Nick insulting everyone and Nicole ruining the Hollywood star and falling in love with Nick. But for me the most surrealistic sequence is actually the real one of the film with Nick's mother acting better than the real actors. Basically the plot is really simple, showing a lot of takes of the three different scenes but there is always a different detail for every single take and a different reaction of the great characters, you will be asking: now, what's next? what could f*ck more the film of Nick? The cast is just superb; for me this role ranks in Steve Buscemi's top five, and that's a really difficult decision because he is an amazing actor with many memorable characters like Mr. Pink, Donny or Seymor from "Reservoir Dogs", "The Big Lebowski" and "Ghost World". I really love this character that was based upon Buscemi's own experiences during his first attempts of making his debut film "Trees Lounge". The supporting cast is amazing too, with the lovely Catherine Keener as a not very famous actress who's major recognition was a shower scene in a Richard Gere film. James LeGros is really funny as Chad Palomino, the Hollywood star who works with Nick just because he think Nick was tight with Quentin Tarantino. And Dermot Mulroney as Wolf, the loyal camera man who is always supporting Nick. Conclusion: Tom DiCillo was used to this kind of situations due to the difficult filming of his debut film, in "Living in Oblivon" he creates an hilarious parody of low- budget films that all the cinema lovers must check. This film is one my personal favourites of the 90's and maybe ever and is a gem of low- budget film-making. 10 out of 10 DVD: this film is practically unknown in Mexico so i have to order this DVD. Is a single edition with some bonus like comments of Buscemi and interviews with DiCillo and Buscemi. In cases like this one, to can watch a film like this is just enough.

    A Low Budget Movie About Making a Low Budget Movie

    This is a low budget film about making a low budget film by a guy who seems to always make low budget films. What this film reveals to us is not only the problems and the stress that comes about with all film making, but that which is generally connected with making low budget films. What sets low budget films apart from other normal films is that because there is a huge limit on funds available, other things are needed to draw the crowds, such as real characters and experimental filming techniques. This film begins in black and white, but when the filming begins, the film switches to colour. In the next section, it is the opposite, with the normal sequences being in colour and the filming sequences in black and white. Living in Oblivion is divided into three parts, and each of these parts a different scene is being filmed. The whole goal of this movie is that a scene in the movie is filmed, and Nick (Steve Buschemi), the director, seems to always run into problems when the filming begins. The way DiCillo makes the movie, which is very similar to what he did in Johnny Suede, leaves you wondering what is real and what is not. He is very clever with his dream sequences as they are indistinguishable from reality, except that everything ends up destroyed. Yet, the dream sequence in the film that is being made is the opposite, with smoke machines and dwarfs. The lead actors in the film are also important. One is a struggling actress who only did a shower scene in a Richard Geare movie. The famous actor is a complete snob and wants everything done his way, and he prances around acting as if he owned the entire movie. It seems that DiCillo is making a comment about actors who think that they make movies and without them the movie wouldn't exist. It is interesting that a Hollywood writer said that there is no such thing as a bankable product, and just because an actor is popular, doesn't mean that he is going to make millions from a movie. Living in Oblivion is a type of movie that I like because it focuses on characters and the relationships that cause problems. The director is not afraid to experiment, nor make comments about people, such as famous actors. Mostly, he tries to reveal to us what it really is like on a set of a low budget movies, and the problems that they face.

    Tom DiCillo's (yeah, never heard of him either) thinly veiled attack on (1) Brad Pitt and (2) Indie film-making is a movie about making movies joining much better films such as "Barton Fink" and, to a lesser extent, "The Player" in this sub-sub-subgenre. It follows the always corpse-like Steve Buscemi as a director just trying to film two scenes in a seemingly awful low-budget independent production that has the distinction of snaring a megastar who is trying to build cred played by Brad Pitt look (sorta)-alike James LeGros. The Pitt character (the comically named Chad Palomino) is pure satire of the spoiled star who believes their least inventive whim is pure genius while the others are fleshed out to the extent that we get a look into their interior lives, anxieties and to some degree hopes. There are extended dream sequences, some attempts at "Spinal Tap"-esque humor (and the smoke machine went crazy!!!!) and a whole lotta characters tossing F-bombs at one another (shocking!!!). Everyone on the set has slept with a least one other person, Buscemi's addled mom shows up and the whole mess tries way too hard to be either funny or poignant or insider hip or something. If you ever wanted to see Buscemi try to carry a film or if like to feel hip by picking a movie that makes fun of movies themselves you might enjoy this -- I didn't. If you want a movie about movie-making, try "Hooper", the 1978 Burt Reynolds vehicle about stuntmen making movies. Believe it or not, there was a (really brief) time when Burt Reynolds was so bankable that studios would sign a blank check and let he, Hal Needham, Dom Deluise, Mary Lou Henner, sometimes Sally Fields and random celebrities like quarterback Terry Bradshaw or drunk (may he rest in peace) Dean Martin just go out and wing it in front of the camera. "Hooper" is a complete mess but actually entertaining as opposed to tightly directed and produced but only conceptually entertaining.

    This is an Awesome Film with in a Film. Buschemi is very good playing the lead role as we usually see him playing cameo roles. If you are a film maker like myself I would recommend watching this film, other films similar to this such as The Independent, Bowfinger and the small indie film's American Movie and Le Fear hold weight in this genre, however Liing in Oblivion has to edge it for me and has it all when it comes to films in this genre, it also has a back story which makes it more interesting as both lead actors Catherine Keener and James LeGros have a fling and the atmosphere on set is intense. my rating for this movie is 8 out of 10.

    Having spent the better half of the last 7 years working on both sides of the camera, I can sympathize with filmmakers and actors. Most people have this mistaken notion that "All you have to do is push a button and act a little here and there." But that is not the case at all. Whenever the camera is rolling and the director calls "ACTION", practically anything could happen... and often does! What's so great about LIVING IN OBLIVION is that Tom DiCillo turns the camera around and shows us what really happens behind the scenes. And nothing is spared. We get to see the odd mix of nerves, ennui, exhaustion, desperation, disappointments, and surprises, deftly handled with a comedic touch. Steve Buscemi (who is no stranger to directing) gives his best performance as Nick Reve, the quirky director who tries to keep everything from falling apart. And if ever a struggling filmmaker needed some inspiration, this movie would grant it! For anyone thinking of making a movie, I'd highly recommend watching this movie and "American Movie" on a double bill!

    Small, low budget films hold a special place in many film goer's hearts. We embrace them as our own special offspring. It's an irrational attachment we have for them, like kidnapping our neighbor's child. But cinema, apparently, is some sort of expression of our collective desire to be acknowledged, to be contributing to the public conversation. That's a bizarre, absurd role to demand of independent films, of any film, but that's the weird world we've been born into, isn't it? The ignored, unnoticed independent film is often the container and conveyor of our most salient, real desires. Frustration and anxiety are palpable, ever present qualities of modern life, and low budget films should not be exempt. Tom DiCillo has incorporated these discomforting, disturbing qualities into his poignantly absurd film. The production of the film within the film is at the mercy of unpredictable, arbitrary forces, like malfunctioning smoke machines, incompetent crew members, emotionally distracted actors, and just plain bad luck. Nothing is as effortless and perfect as it is in the "real" movies. This revelation elevates this film into the realm of essential; essential for anyone who is considering making their own independent low budget film, and essential for any fan of quality non Studio, non mega budget films. That it can be so impossible just getting a single scene "into the can"  the expression for capturing on film a worthwhile moment  is a potent metaphor for all our own endeavors. We are continually assaulted with the infinite demands of our mundane lives but are so wiling to sacrifice so much of our precious time to the act of getting it just right, whatever "it" may be. We need to be succeeding at something, anything, in order to feel worthy. And maniacal persistence is the indispensable means to success. However, it's usually a non productive hobby, past time or diversion that occupies us so insistently. Living in Oblivion is a rare opportunity to examine this impulse of ours to perfect relatively minor, inconsequential things. The conceit of the film is that we, the audience, like to believe that we are above and beyond such tedious, temporal concerns, yet we are equally, undeniably fascinated by the intricacies of the "inner" film's creation. "How would I do it?" is a question that frames every scene. But our involvement is irrelevant. That's the paradox at this film's core. That's the ultimate message here, that we, the audience, are inconsequential. That might sound bleak and morose to some, but I found it deeply satisfying. I am not responsible, in the end, for this film's success. I am only watching. Tom DiCillo has earned a reputation as an iconoclast, as a rebel, as an anti establishment defender of the individual. I'm not sure just how justified is this reputation - he has lately directed arguably crappy TV such as Law and Order - but still, he proves himself a potent source of genuinely profound insights in this film. You will learn what it feels like to be an ambitious, hopeful, idealistic artist working in a crass, indifferent, commercial world. That's a rare treat. The fact that Steve Buschemi, Katherine Keener, and Dermot Mulroney are so wonderfully natural is proof that Dicillo has golden instincts. We are granted access to these artist's most transcendent talents. I've seen them all in many different, fantastic roles, but here they are at their absolute best, their most real. That's a quality that nearly all films aspire too, but so very few achieve. Enjoy this film for this commendable fact along with the knowledge that it's nearly impossible to make a film like this today or ever again. (David Lynch did it in 2006 with his Inland Empire which has been ignored by the general film going public. It's a monumentally original, powerful, revolutionary film experience.

    This is a low budget film about making a low budget film by a guy who seems to always make low budget films. What this film reveals to us is not only the problems and the stress that comes about with all film making, but that which is generally connected with making low budget films. What sets low budget films apart from other normal films is that because there is a huge limit on funds available, other things are needed to draw the crowds, such as real characters and experimental filming techniques. This film begins in black and white, but when the filming begins, the film switches to colour. In the next section, it is the opposite, with the normal sequences being in colour and the filming sequences in black and white. Living in Oblivion is divided into three parts, and each of these parts a different scene is being filmed. The whole goal of this movie is that a scene in the movie is filmed, and Nick (Steve Buschemi), the director, seems to always run into problems when the filming begins. The way DiCillo makes the movie, which is very similar to what he did in Johnny Suede, leaves you wondering what is real and what is not. He is very clever with his dream sequences as they are indistinguishable from reality, except that everything ends up destroyed. Yet, the dream sequence in the film that is being made is the opposite, with smoke machines and dwarfs. The lead actors in the film are also important. One is a struggling actress who only did a shower scene in a Richard Geare movie. The famous actor is a complete snob and wants everything done his way, and he prances around acting as if he owned the entire movie. It seems that DiCillo is making a comment about actors who think that they make movies and without them the movie wouldn't exist. It is interesting that a Hollywood writer said that there is no such thing as a bankable product, and just because an actor is popular, doesn't mean that he is going to make millions from a movie. Living in Oblivion is a type of movie that I like because it focuses on characters and the relationships that cause problems. The director is not afraid to experiment, nor make comments about people, such as famous actors. Mostly, he tries to reveal to us what it really is like on a set of a low budget movies, and the problems that they face.

    Tom DiCillo's (yeah, never heard of him either) thinly veiled attack on (1) Brad Pitt and (2) Indie film-making is a movie about making movies joining much better films such as "Barton Fink" and, to a lesser extent, "The Player" in this sub-sub-subgenre. It follows the always corpse-like Steve Buscemi as a director just trying to film two scenes in a seemingly awful low-budget independent production that has the distinction of snaring a megastar who is trying to build cred played by Brad Pitt look (sorta)-alike James LeGros. The Pitt character (the comically named Chad Palomino) is pure satire of the spoiled star who believes their least inventive whim is pure genius while the others are fleshed out to the extent that we get a look into their interior lives, anxieties and to some degree hopes. There are extended dream sequences, some attempts at "Spinal Tap"-esque humor (and the smoke machine went crazy!!!!) and a whole lotta characters tossing F-bombs at one another (shocking!!!). Everyone on the set has slept with a least one other person, Buscemi's addled mom shows up and the whole mess tries way too hard to be either funny or poignant or insider hip or something. If you ever wanted to see Buscemi try to carry a film or if like to feel hip by picking a movie that makes fun of movies themselves you might enjoy this -- I didn't. If you want a movie about movie-making, try "Hooper", the 1978 Burt Reynolds vehicle about stuntmen making movies. Believe it or not, there was a (really brief) time when Burt Reynolds was so bankable that studios would sign a blank check and let he, Hal Needham, Dom Deluise, Mary Lou Henner, sometimes Sally Fields and random celebrities like quarterback Terry Bradshaw or drunk (may he rest in peace) Dean Martin just go out and wing it in front of the camera. "Hooper" is a complete mess but actually entertaining as opposed to tightly directed and produced but only conceptually entertaining.

    This is an Awesome Film with in a Film. Buschemi is very good playing the lead role as we usually see him playing cameo roles. If you are a film maker like myself I would recommend watching this film, other films similar to this such as The Independent, Bowfinger and the small indie film's American Movie and Le Fear hold weight in this genre, however Liing in Oblivion has to edge it for me and has it all when it comes to films in this genre, it also has a back story which makes it more interesting as both lead actors Catherine Keener and James LeGros have a fling and the atmosphere on set is intense. my rating for this movie is 8 out of 10.

    Having spent the better half of the last 7 years working on both sides of the camera, I can sympathize with filmmakers and actors. Most people have this mistaken notion that "All you have to do is push a button and act a little here and there." But that is not the case at all. Whenever the camera is rolling and the director calls "ACTION", practically anything could happen... and often does! What's so great about LIVING IN OBLIVION is that Tom DiCillo turns the camera around and shows us what really happens behind the scenes. And nothing is spared. We get to see the odd mix of nerves, ennui, exhaustion, desperation, disappointments, and surprises, deftly handled with a comedic touch. Steve Buscemi (who is no stranger to directing) gives his best performance as Nick Reve, the quirky director who tries to keep everything from falling apart. And if ever a struggling filmmaker needed some inspiration, this movie would grant it! For anyone thinking of making a movie, I'd highly recommend watching this movie and "American Movie" on a double bill!

    Small, low budget films hold a special place in many film goer's hearts. We embrace them as our own special offspring. It's an irrational attachment we have for them, like kidnapping our neighbor's child. But cinema, apparently, is some sort of expression of our collective desire to be acknowledged, to be contributing to the public conversation. That's a bizarre, absurd role to demand of independent films, of any film, but that's the weird world we've been born into, isn't it? The ignored, unnoticed independent film is often the container and conveyor of our most salient, real desires. Frustration and anxiety are palpable, ever present qualities of modern life, and low budget films should not be exempt. Tom DiCillo has incorporated these discomforting, disturbing qualities into his poignantly absurd film. The production of the film within the film is at the mercy of unpredictable, arbitrary forces, like malfunctioning smoke machines, incompetent crew members, emotionally distracted actors, and just plain bad luck. Nothing is as effortless and perfect as it is in the "real" movies. This revelation elevates this film into the realm of essential; essential for anyone who is considering making their own independent low budget film, and essential for any fan of quality non Studio, non mega budget films. That it can be so impossible just getting a single scene "into the can"  the expression for capturing on film a worthwhile moment  is a potent metaphor for all our own endeavors. We are continually assaulted with the infinite demands of our mundane lives but are so wiling to sacrifice so much of our precious time to the act of getting it just right, whatever "it" may be. We need to be succeeding at something, anything, in order to feel worthy. And maniacal persistence is the indispensable means to success. However, it's usually a non productive hobby, past time or diversion that occupies us so insistently. Living in Oblivion is a rare opportunity to examine this impulse of ours to perfect relatively minor, inconsequential things. The conceit of the film is that we, the audience, like to believe that we are above and beyond such tedious, temporal concerns, yet we are equally, undeniably fascinated by the intricacies of the "inner" film's creation. "How would I do it?" is a question that frames every scene. But our involvement is irrelevant. That's the paradox at this film's core. That's the ultimate message here, that we, the audience, are inconsequential. That might sound bleak and morose to some, but I found it deeply satisfying. I am not responsible, in the end, for this film's success. I am only watching. Tom DiCillo has earned a reputation as an iconoclast, as a rebel, as an anti establishment defender of the individual. I'm not sure just how justified is this reputation - he has lately directed arguably crappy TV such as Law and Order - but still, he proves himself a potent source of genuinely profound insights in this film. You will learn what it feels like to be an ambitious, hopeful, idealistic artist working in a crass, indifferent, commercial world. That's a rare treat. The fact that Steve Buschemi, Katherine Keener, and Dermot Mulroney are so wonderfully natural is proof that Dicillo has golden instincts. We are granted access to these artist's most transcendent talents. I've seen them all in many different, fantastic roles, but here they are at their absolute best, their most real. That's a quality that nearly all films aspire too, but so very few achieve. Enjoy this film for this commendable fact along with the knowledge that it's nearly impossible to make a film like this today or ever again. (David Lynch did it in 2006 with his Inland Empire which has been ignored by the general film going public. It's a monumentally original, powerful, revolutionary film experience. Charlie Kaufman also accomplished a tremendous feat of originality with his phenomenal Synecdoche, NY from 2008. Both films are subtle expressions of artistic desire in the face of a coldly indifferent, if not outright maliciously violent culture.)

    I stood this for 41:33---root canal is more bearable than this gruesomely predictable time- waster from the indie psycho ward. All the by-the-numbers indie elements are here: zero budget, non-existent production value, flaccid pace,"edgy" characters (=weirdos), cut-&-paste "script" (no more than a collection of notions about what a film *really* is)---in other words, the same old indie riff.*Yawn* They crank these things out, like sausages, for the tax break that these born-to-lose duds provide- --their only reason for being. These indie dogs have a liturgical quality---lovable losers struggling through life, make you laugh/make you cry, blase blase. Absolutely nothing new here. The inevitable Steve Buscemi--- hideously loathsome in the stomach-turning "Ghost World" (2001), is here doing his indie thing (=pre-psychotic nut-job) for the ten thousandth time. Next case. This is pure indie, to the bone: ad infinitum, ad nauseum, ad absurdum. There will always be a small hard-core audience for junk like this, just like the market for '70s TV sit-coms, banjo music, political "documentaries", etc. "Bad & The Beautiful" (1951) and "Le Mepris/Contempt" (1963) are the real-deal films about movie-making, made by pros who knew what they were doing---but for grown-up adults only. Indie-stoner characters will salivate over this, for sure---they're an easy sell. It's worth noting this pimple got SEVEN "awards". From whom, and for what ? "Citizen Kane" (1941) only got three.

    Place this in a time capsule and see how much future generations will relate to Nick and his adventures. The strength in this movie is the casting and just watch to see how the indie scene in the '90's could formulate this cast. Buscemi plays one of his most memorable characters in his facet (which is saying a lot for the King of Indies). Catherine Keener perfected her Catherine Keener-demeanor (if there ever was one) in this flick and gave a new purpose for Preparation H. Peter Dinklidge gives a deep concentrated monologue about the 'importance' of dwarfs in film. Dermont Mulrony rocks the s**t out of an eye patch and has some of the plays off of every actor so casually that it is characterization to the highest degree. And poor James LeGroes missing out on the Brad Pitt boat because he out-pits Pitt! Tom DiCillo was an indie master before this with his previous work with Jim Jarmusch but the fact that he never settled for the high road after this flick makes him miss his mark as a new Billy Wilde, and instead had to settle for being Tom DiCillo

    When this came out it was marketed as a slacker or Indie comedy, so I was especially careful to avoid it. Big mistake. I just saw this now out of a misguided sense of completism, and it's a great movie. Tom DiCillo is like one of the guys who tells your favourite joke, the one you have told hundreds of times, but in a way that people actually laugh at it. It actually IS an indie comedy about the making of a low-budget movie, but don't let that throw you off. This movie also proves the great comedic value of repetition. When that dwar-- ... erm, vertically disadvantaged person walks around Catherine Keener with his apple for the twentieth time, this otherwise trivial scene just cracks you up. In a way I'd advise you to NOT watch this movie after you have inhaled, the same way I'd advise you against mixing acid with zombie movies. It's all in the magic mixture of an excellent script, excellent actors (the smaller roles (no pun intended, but Tito is also great) as well as Keener and Buscemi) and excellent direction. Hollywood please take note, more is not needed for an intelligent and entertaining movie. I'd give 8 points but as this movie really surprised me and needs to be seen by more people I'll gerrymander it up to a gleaming 9.

    You're the director of a low budget film and all you have to do is get all the different disparate elements to come together and get everyone to peak and not screw up all at the same time, and then you're making a mother f*cking movie. Apart from on this day everything seems to be going wrong. Relationships are falling apart, actors aren't acting, stars aren't starring and the crew seem more intent on getting in front of the camera rather than staying behind it. In Tom Dicillo's perfect satire on the troublesome process of movie making, the comedy of errors that transpires is one of the funniest that has ever been put on celluloid, with Steve Buscemi flawless and hilarious as the director having a nightmare as events conspire to spoil his film. The dialogue is so damn good that it becomes the kind of quotable fare that just filters into your regular daily language. Dermot Mulroney and Catherine Keener are also excellent as the neurotic actress and art-house cameraman respectively. Whilst there is much dispute over which sequences is the best, for me, it's the last one filming the dream sequence, with the dwarf with an attitude problem who makes mini-me seem like an ewok on Valium. If it's at your video store rent it, if it's for sale buy it. It's well worth the purchase and will b a film that's a joy to watch more than once.

    Nick (Steve Buscemi) is directing a low-budget film called Living in Oblivion, that is having a lot of problems during the filming. When the crew is ready the actors can't remember their lines and when the actors are making the scene in a superb way the camera isn't filming. Things like that are even in Nick's dreams and in the dreams of his main actress, Nicole (Catherine Keener), so Nick must deal with the problems of making low-budget films. "Living in Oblivion", the second film written & directed by Tom DiCillo, is one of the most original films that i have ever seen and is an hilarious and strange low-budget comedy about low-budget film-making. The film is divide in three parts showing the dreams of Nick and Nicole and one real scene of Nick's film. But is all fun with this director and his bizarre crew dealing with a Hollywood star (James LeGros) who wants to change the film and with the mother of Nick (Laurel Thomby) who is interfering with the filming. The dreams are just how Nick and Nicole would love to deal with a problematic situation like that, Nick insulting everyone and Nicole ruining the Hollywood star and falling in love with Nick. But for me the most surrealistic sequence is actually the real one of the film with Nick's mother acting better than the real actors. Basically the plot is really simple, showing a lot of takes of the three different scenes but there is always a different detail for every single take and a different reaction of the great characters, you will be asking: now, what's next? what could f*ck more the film of Nick? The cast is just superb; for me this role ranks in Steve Buscemi's top five, and that's a really difficult decision because he is an amazing actor with many memorable characters like Mr. Pink, Donny or Seymor from "Reservoir Dogs", "The Big Lebowski" and "Ghost World". I really love this character that was based upon Buscemi's own experiences during his first attempts of making his debut film "Trees Lounge". The supporting cast is amazing too, with the lovely Catherine Keener as a not very famous actress who's major recognition was a shower scene in a Richard Gere film. James LeGros is really funny as Chad Palomino, the Hollywood star who works with Nick just because he think Nick was tight with Quentin Tarantino. And Dermot Mulroney as Wolf, the loyal camera man who is always supporting Nick. Conclusion: Tom DiCillo was used to this kind of situations due to the difficult filming of his debut film, in "Living in Oblivon" he creates an hilarious parody of low- budget films that all the cinema lovers must check. This film is one my personal favourites of the 90's and maybe ever and is a gem of low- budget film-making. 10 out of 10 DVD: this film is practically unknown in Mexico so i have to order this DVD. Is a single edition with some bonus like comments of Buscemi and interviews with DiCillo and Buscemi. In cases like this one, to can watch a film like this is just enough.

    I stood this for 41:33---root canal is more bearable than this gruesomely predictable time- waster from the indie psycho ward. All the by-the-numbers indie elements are here: zero budget, non-existent production value, flaccid pace,"edgy" characters (=weirdos), cut-&-paste "script" (no more than a collection of notions about what a film *really* is)---in other words, the same old indie riff.*Yawn* They crank these things out, like sausages, for the tax break that these born-to-lose duds provide- --their only reason for being. These indie dogs have a liturgical quality---lovable losers struggling through life, make you laugh/make you cry, blase blase. Absolutely nothing new here. The inevitable Steve Buscemi--- hideously loathsome in the stomach-turning "Ghost World" (2001), is here doing his indie thing (=pre-psychotic nut-job) for the ten thousandth time. Next case. This is pure indie, to the bone: ad infinitum, ad nauseum, ad absurdum. There will always be a small hard-core audience for junk like this, just like the market for '70s TV sit-coms, banjo music, political "documentaries", etc. "Bad & The Beautiful" (1951) and "Le Mepris/Contempt" (1963) are the real-deal films about movie-making, made by pros who knew what they were doing---but for grown-up adults only. Indie-stoner characters will salivate over this, for sure---they're an easy sell. It's worth noting this pimple got SEVEN "awards". From whom, and for what ? "Citizen Kane" (1941) only got three.

    Place this in a time capsule and see how much future generations will relate to Nick and his adventures. The strength in this movie is the casting and just watch to see how the indie scene in the '90's could formulate this cast. Buscemi plays one of his most memorable characters in his facet (which is saying a lot for the King of Indies). Catherine Keener perfected her Catherine Keener-demeanor (if there ever was one) in this flick and gave a new purpose for Preparation H. Peter Dinklidge gives a deep concentrated monologue about the 'importance' of dwarfs in film. Dermont Mulrony rocks the s**t out of an eye patch and has some of the plays off of every actor so casually that it is characterization to the highest degree. And poor James LeGroes missing out on the Brad Pitt boat because he out-pits Pitt! Tom DiCillo was an indie master before this with his previous work with Jim Jarmusch but the fact that he never settled for the high road after this flick makes him miss his mark as a new Billy Wilde, and instead had to settle for being Tom DiCillo

    When this came out it was marketed as a slacker or Indie comedy, so I was especially careful to avoid it. Big mistake. I just saw this now out of a misguided sense of completism, and it's a great movie. Tom DiCillo is like one of the guys who tells your favourite joke, the one you have told hundreds of times, but in a way that people actually laugh at it. It actually IS an indie comedy about the making of a low-budget movie, but don't let that throw you off. This movie also proves the great comedic value of repetition. When that dwar-- ... erm, vertically disadvantaged person walks around Catherine Keener with his apple for the twentieth time, this otherwise trivial scene just cracks you up. In a way I'd advise you to NOT watch this movie after you have inhaled, the same way I'd advise you against mixing acid with zombie movies. It's all in the magic mixture of an excellent script, excellent actors (the smaller roles (no pun intended, but Tito is also great) as well as Keener and Buscemi) and excellent direction. Hollywood please take note, more is not needed for an intelligent and entertaining movie. I'd give 8 points but as this movie really surprised me and needs to be seen by more people I'll gerrymander it up to a gleaming 9.

    You're the director of a low budget film and all you have to do is get all the different disparate elements to come together and get everyone to peak and not screw up all at the same time, and then you're making a mother f*cking movie. Apart from on this day everything seems to be going wrong. Relationships are falling apart, actors aren't acting, stars aren't starring and the crew seem more intent on getting in front of the camera rather than staying behind it. In Tom Dicillo's perfect satire on the troublesome process of movie making, the comedy of errors that transpires is one of the funniest that has ever been put on celluloid, with Steve Buscemi flawless and hilarious as the director having a nightmare as events conspire to spoil his film. The dialogue is so damn good that it becomes the kind of quotable fare that just filters into your regular daily language. Dermot Mulroney and Catherine Keener are also excellent as the neurotic actress and art-house cameraman respectively. Whilst there is much dispute over which sequences is the best, for me, it's the last one filming the dream sequence, with the dwarf with an attitude problem who makes mini-me seem like an ewok on Valium. If it's at your video store rent it, if it's for sale buy it. It's well worth the purchase and will b a film that's a joy to watch more than once.

    Nick (Steve Buscemi) is directing a low-budget film called Living in Oblivion, that is having a lot of problems during the filming. When the crew is ready the actors can't remember their lines and when the actors are making the scene in a superb way the camera isn't filming. Things like that are even in Nick's dreams and in the dreams of his main actress, Nicole (Catherine Keener), so Nick must deal with the problems of making low-budget films. "Living in Oblivion", the second film written & directed by Tom DiCillo, is one of the most original films that i have ever seen and is an hilarious and strange low-budget comedy about low-budget film-making. The film is divide in three parts showing the dreams of Nick and Nicole and one real scene of Nick's film. But is all fun with this director and his bizarre crew dealing with a Hollywood star (James LeGros) who wants to change the film and with the mother of Nick (Laurel Thomby) who is interfering with the filming. The dreams are just how Nick and Nicole would love to deal with a problematic situation like that, Nick insulting everyone and Nicole ruining the Hollywood star and falling in love with Nick. But for me the most surrealistic sequence is actually the real one of the film with Nick's mother acting better than the real actors. Basically the plot is really simple, showing a lot of takes of the three different scenes but there is always a different detail for every single take and a different reaction of the great characters, you will be asking: now, what's next? what could f*ck more the film of Nick? The cast is just superb; for me this role ranks in Steve Buscemi's top five, and that's a really difficult decision because he is an amazing actor with many memorable characters like Mr. Pink, Donny or Seymor from "Reservoir Dogs", "The Big Lebowski" and "Ghost World". I really love this character that was based upon Buscemi's own experiences during his first attempts of making his debut film "Trees Lounge". The supporting cast is amazing too, with the lovely Catherine Keener as a not very famous actress who's major recognition was a shower scene in a Richard Gere film. James LeGros is really funny as Chad Palomino, the Hollywood star who works with Nick just because he think Nick was tight with Quentin Tarantino. And Dermot Mulroney as Wolf, the loyal camera man who is always supporting Nick. Conclusion: Tom DiCillo was used to this kind of situations due to the difficult filming of his debut film, in "Living in Oblivon" he creates an hilarious parody of low- budget films that all the cinema lovers must check. This film is one my personal favourites of the 90's and maybe ever and is a gem of low- budget film-making. 10 out of 10 DVD: this film is practically unknown in Mexico so i have to order this DVD. Is a single edition with some bonus like comments of Buscemi and interviews with DiCillo and Buscemi. In cases like this one, to can watch a film like this is just enough.
