    I gave this sequel seven stars because, despite the fact that this film has some problems, it's still a good popcorn pusher - and there are worse ways to waste over an hour of your precious mortal life span. It's not Oscar material - but it's OK. Some parts were even emotionally satisfying. I liked Vincent Perez in the title role. He brought an interesting level of maturity to the character, and the fact that he was not playing a natively born American Crow gave a new sense of cosmic universality to the concept of the possessing avenging spirit that is the Crow character essentially. Although I liked the plot twist that the Crow was avenging his child as opposed to a wife or lover because it gave the film somewhat of a different, more "across the board" emotional relatability, I still felt that about 70% of the film was a template derivative of the original, with far too many common elements to fully assert it's expectations to truly stand on it's own. Richard Brooks made an interesting arch nemesis, but the character of Judah Earl I found to be a little too self absorbed and narcissistic to really invest a great deal of focus on. Brooks's character was more interested in complete personal exaltation and fulfillment and less interested in a grander ethos, which made his motivations too one dimensional and clich&eacute; for me to be interested in. Brooks however did do well with the predictable character profile that he was provided by the writers - and I think that he pushed it as far as he could as a gifted actor. Mia Kirshner's character of Sarah, apparently the little girl from the original Crow film, was disappointing. The character of the child Sarah from the original Brandon Lee film was a tough kid that was practical, down to Earth, and that had a more pragmatic, everyday way of looking at things - while Mia Kirshner's Sarah was too vulnerable, creepy, and far too "witchy" to be believed as the adult extension of the original. Kirshner's character in this film would have been the last place that you would have expected the original character of Sarah to have ended up. It seemed to be a device created by the writers to over accentuate the occultism of the film - which was overkill and over saturating. My problem is not with Kirshner's performance, it was splendid - it was with the revised "update" of her character that deviated far too much from the personality of the original Sarah character that it undermined the character's continuity from the first film. All in all - not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better, had the film makers been more attentive to the defining elements of the original film, yet had taken the time to develop some of the characters better - and had deleted a few of the more derivative clich&eacute; character types and elements.

    I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them. First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying. The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected. I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them. What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.

    It takes off after about 20 minutes or so. Pretty much once we reach the hell ride there is a leap in quality that is of course overshadowed by the weaknesses of the scene which follows. I feel it's at about the point where he pulls out the deck of cards and the way he does it the film finally starts to fulfill expectations. Overall it's certainly worth watching but I do not challenge the dislike so many people have for it. When you watch it with an open mind, you can see about 20 minutes of footage needs to be cut, rewrote, reshot and maybe 5 or 10 minutes of footage added for story and character setup. I watch this movie once every couple years and each time I think omG this is BAD. Then as always, it gets better as the story continues not better each time you watch it. The fact is, they could have fixed everything wrong with it and it might have still been a box office disappointment. People wanted Brandon or at least an exact duplicate of the first in far too many respects for this B caliber sequel to get a chance. All that speculation cast aside, I still see the potential in this film that if explored properly, would have produced a sequel as amazing as the first. The soundtrack just wasn't there and the 20 minutes of turd needed to be cut, rewrote and reshot. It also doesn't help that the footage looks like it was shot on a high quality JVC commercial grade camcorder with the same texture as soap operas and low budget TV shows then some type of opaque effect added for a generic comic book feel. That says everything really. This was one of the first B-movies in many years to find it's way into the theater. That in itself is quite an achievement even though it's pretty common today. However, you'll find majority of the B-movies that followed it's coat tails into theaters were similar genre and visual style. It actually paved the door for a lot of the B-movies that squirmed their way into theaters from various genres, not just these dark fantasy action thrillers. For better or for worse, we now see a lot of B movies in theaters that are absolute garbage compared to this film.

    Everybody who saw "The Crow" (1994), a grisly but formulaic back-fr0m-the-dead revenge melodrama, knows actor Brandon Lee died from an accidental gunshot wound on the set during filming. Strangely enough, Lee's untimely demise boosted the box office appeal of "The Crow." The success prompted Miramax Pictures to release a sequel of sorts: "The Crow: City of Angels." Not only have the film producers replaced Lee with another actor, but they also have conjured up an entirely new character. Sequels typically fail to live up to the high standards of most original films, but "The Crow: City of Angels" proves the exception to the rule. The message of "The Crow: City of Angels," a nihilistic supernatural sadomasochistic saga, is that love is sometimes stronger than death. Nevertheless, love takes a backseat to violence in this expressionistic follow-up to the ill-fated but financially successful original. Instead, the filmmakers aim their cameras like guns at the more unsavory narrative elements: brutal murders and echoes of deviant sexual practices with an incidental node to the love aspect. The premise of the first "Crow" reechoes throughout the sequel. When somebody dies, a crow carries the soul to the land of the dead. Occasionally, something so horrible occurs that a soul can find no rest. In such a case, the crow leads the soul back to the living so that injustices can be resolved. David Goyer, who penned the original "Crow," tinkers rather than tampers with the surefire formula that yielded a $50 million haul at the box office. A cadaverous hero rises from the grave and destroys a depraved gang of low-life hemorrhoids. In "The Crow: City of Angels," a twenty-something auto mechanic, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez of "Queen Margot"), and his young son Danny (Eric Acosta of "Cheerleader Massacre 2") witness a gangland execution by a drug kingpin called Judah. The setting has been changed from the Motor City to the City of Angels. Instead of hoodlums celebrating Devil's Night, as in the original, here citizens participate in the Day of the Dead ceremonies designed to discourage departing spirits from lingering with the living. Eight years have elapsed since the first movie, and Sarah (Mia Kirshner of "Not Another Teen Movie") is the only hold-over character from the original. Sarah has grown up, moved to Los Angeles, and now runs a tattoo parlor. Sarah has been having nightmares lately, about a double homicide. A crow flies into her apartment, and she follows it to the harbor where the bodies of Ash and his son were dumped. The crow revives Ashe, and he emerges in a frothy fountain of bubbles before Sarah's eyes. When Ashe embarks on his revenge, Sarah paints his face in the same Harlequin pattern as Eric Draven's from the first film. Only this time, she uses Ashe's dead son's paints, giving it a truly symbolic meaning. Ashe begins knocking off Judah's (Richard Brooks) henchmen, working his way, as he calls it "up the food chain" to Judah himself. The villains comprise an undeniably loathsome bunch. You'd certainly never invite these scumbags home to meet your parents. Curve, (plug-ugly Iggy Pop of "Tank Girl") resembles death warmed over, while a dark smooth-skinned Richard Brooks as Judah presents a commanding presence. The drug dealing merchant of pain here is so repellent that he display little remorse when a poorly mixed batch of his own narcotics kills his customers. Every time one of these reptilian characters dies, the image of a crow appears around him. For example, when Ashe pitches one baddie from a window, the blood from the dead person's head coagulates in a puddle shaped like a crow. Compared with the first film, "City of Angels" isn't as violent. There is nothing here that comes off as violent as the table scene where Brandon Lee's Eric Draven got blasted by a barrage of gunfire. French heartthrob Vincent Perez animates his slain avenger with a Gallic exuberance. Perez's performance also conveys a quality that makes his character vulnerable and at the same time somewhat melancholy because he is deprived of life. Ashe reveals his reluctance to Sarah to blindly adhere to the fix path that fate has paved for him. Audiences learn the bare minimum about him. All we know about his wife is that she abounded him and their son after she became a drug addict. Unlike Eric Draven, Ashe's body doesn't erase the signs of violence. Gunshot wounds don't magically vanish. He spends more time tooling about on his motorcycle in search of felons and he never carries the crow around on his shoulder. Goyer's episodic script resembles a formula Republic serial from the 1940s. A mysterious hero enters a destitute city and topples a tyrant. Compared with the longer original film, "City of Angels" amounts to a severely pared down exercise in minimalism. The filmmakers have sacrificed exposition, which would clarify characters and story, for supercharged, headlong momentum. If you're looking for exposition, try the web site for "The Crow: City of Angels," because only the most essential information for pushing the plot forward remains in the film. Goyer and director Tim Pope keep the narrative simple, the characters shallow, and the story free from complications or digressive sub-plots. Extraneous characters, such as Ernie Hudson's cop from the first "Crow" don't clutter up the storyline. "The Crow: City of Angels" marks the motion picture debut of music-video director Tim Pope. Previously, Pope helmed music videos for Paul McCartney, Iggy Pop, Queen, and David Bowie. Pope clearly draws on his background so that his "Crow" boasts a fast-paced, no-nonsense, imagine intensive appearance. The film possesses a murky, Gothic look. Smoke swirls around the different bombed-out nocturnal settings, and Pope bathes different scenes in harsh, abrasive color schemes. The wide-angled point of view shots from the perspective of the craw have an avant-garde quality. You don't need to have seen "The Crow" to appreciate "The Crow: City of Angeles."

    The Crow: City of Angels (1996) * 1/2 (out of 4) A vicious drug dealer (Richard Brooks) has mechanic Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) killed along with his wife and young son. A year later the crow leads the mechanic back from the dead for revenge. Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination. The lack of imagination is something that can be said about the majority of this film as this sequel just never gets off the ground.

    Ah, 1996's "The Crow: City of Angels"- the first sequel in the downfall of a once-promising franchise. Directed by Tim Pope and written by David S. Goyer (whom both went on to disown the film due to studio re-edits that destroyed it), this is the tragic misstep that destroyed the series after the incredible 1994 debut. Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man whom was murdered, along with his child, after witnessing a gang-related hit. Some time later (it's never exactly established, but I think it's a short time later), Ashe is brought back by the power of a crow, to seek vengeance. He is helped along the way by Sarah... yes, the same Sarah from the first film, now all grown up and quite stunning (portrayed by the sexy Mia Kirshner). She uses Eric Draven's influence on her to paint the iconic crow makeup onto Ashe and send him on his way, also acting as a slight love interest in the rushed narrative. Ashe is after Judah (Richard Brooks), the drug lord of Los Angelas, who is sort of responsible for the loss of his own life and that of his child. Judah's men (including Thomas Jane, Iggy Pop and the late and great Thuy Trang) are the ones who murdered him. Through a bizarre series of events that just don't "gel" together properly, Judah forms a plan to steal the powers of the crow to make himself invincible, and Ashe must stop him at all costs. To give credit where it is due, there are some good aspects to the film. For starters, Pope's direction is quite nice, on the whole. He went for what seems to be the exact opposite of what Alex Proyas did with the first film. The movie is all in shades of red, orange, purple, etc. It's much harsher and more angry, and camera-work is generally good. Graeme Revell also returns to score the film, and he utilizes a fantastic combination of new themes with musical cues from the prior film. It helps ground them both in the same universe. And the performances aren't bad. However, it stops there. The films really, truly suffers from the studio re-edits. Rumor has it that the original cut of the film was much longer and significantly different, but Miramax, wanting to cash in on the success of the first film, had more than an hour of footage cut, and many scenes re-arranged in the narrative, in order to make it more like the original. And it shows. The pacing is sloppy and characters are left completely undeveloped. In addition, the tragedy and connection to the characters is also severed, and the ending (without spoiling anything) makes no sense whatsoever. The film feels like it's missing the backbone to the story, and what's left after these studio edits feels like an empty shell. It's barely watchable as-is, and isn't very enjoyable. Here's to hoping that one day, we may get the original cut of the film (which isn't the DVD Director's Cut, don't be fooled), and see this film in the best possible way, as the original cut does sound far superior. As it stands, "The Crow: City of Angels" gets a 3 out of 10. It's a worse version of the original film, and should be skipped over by all but die-hard fans who feel they need to see it.

    naturally this movie was not going to live up to the original which is a classic. But, it has its good points. the set up was done well with the murder of the man and son enhanced by good cinematography. I also think the landscape was done well creating a post apocalyptic feel. i think in my eyes the best scene was when the crow retrieves his son from the river and buries him which was enhanced by music from the original crow(best scene id say). the bad points for me was character based, the crow's dialogue and witty remarks i found were not effective. the villains (besides Iggy pop who i think did well) were portrayed weak and not in depth. Main bad point for me was a real weak ending where the crow summons crows to fly through him and destroy the immortal bad guy. thought that was i really poor written ending. I suppose as this was a sequel they couldn't make the concept as subtle as the first one without completely replicating it. still it was enjoyable to watch again after 14 years. probably wont be watching any time soon again tho. oh and at least it didn't have Tara Reid

    Some time ago, Ashe Corven and his son Danny were killed when they stumbled across a pack of drug dealers murdering a fellow dealer. The dealers work for Los Angeles drug kingpin Judah. Local tattoo artist Sarah, who has great knowledge of the crow legend because of what happened with her late friend, has been having dreams about Ashe and Danny. One night when a crow leads her to the scene of the murders of Ashe and Danny, Ashe appears before her. The crow has resurrected Ashe, so Ashe can go after Judah and his right hand man Curve. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing off Judah's men one by one, on his way to Judah. Yes, many think that this film is sacrilege and trounces on Lees grave, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel, very dark, and seems very visceral at times. I love the first movie, it has that tone to it and obviously what happened to Lee makes the film more poignant and essential. It was inevitable that there was going to be a sequel as the film shouts our franchise, whether you like it or not. Perez is obviously no Lee, but he wasn't supposed to be, he is his own 'Crow' ans this film has more of a paternal feel to it, rather than the dark romanticism of the first. And this is where the film usurps the first, the villains in this are more entertaining, even if they are over the top and more theatrical. Judah though, isn't a patch on Top Dollar, but has some good scenes and hilarious dialogue. So all in all it's a sequel, but a heavily underrated one, thanks to obsessed fans of the first who dismissed this. The set pieces are great, the soundtrack as dark as the first, and a whole 'dusk' vibe throughout the whole movie. It's obviously directed by a music video director, as the editing is sharp and some of the cinematography is stark. It's okay to say that this movie is good, you won't offend anyone, or lose the mysticism of the original.

    I wish you could give negative ratings. This is awful, a film without redeeming features. Let's list them. Story - 100% copy Bad Guy - Pathetic Good Guy - An shambolic shadow of Eric Draven Aesthetics - not sure was too dark to see anything. The Crow is one of a few films I would give 10/10 to. As such it is obviously one of my all time favourites. This is my actual least fave film and it includes films I couldn't watch in their entirety such as the original Re-Hash of The Hulk or recently Barbarossa! There is no reason at all to watch this film. it's not camp and therefore funny. It is not ironic, self deprecating or even a decent stand alone flick. Its appalling. Watch something else

    To be honest, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. The visuals are amazing, and the city feels fleshed out. It really feels like you're in a drug infested Los Angeles in the middle of the 90's, something the first film achieved greatly. They didn't go cheesy with this movie as much as they did the titles that followed it (with Ed Furlong and the other guy), but people still see it as a remake. It's actually a sequel, with a more pure love in my opinion than the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, try to watch it with an open mind. Vincent Perez does a great job as the lead role, and completely steals the spotlight from everyone else in the film. It's worth watching for him alone.

    I gave this sequel seven stars because, despite the fact that this film has some problems, it's still a good popcorn pusher - and there are worse ways to waste over an hour of your precious mortal life span. It's not Oscar material - but it's OK. Some parts were even emotionally satisfying. I liked Vincent Perez in the title role. He brought an interesting level of maturity to the character, and the fact that he was not playing a natively born American Crow gave a new sense of cosmic universality to the concept of the possessing avenging spirit that is the Crow character essentially. Although I liked the plot twist that the Crow was avenging his child as opposed to a wife or lover because it gave the film somewhat of a different, more "across the board" emotional relatability, I still felt that about 70% of the film was a template derivative of the original, with far too many common elements to fully assert it's expectations to truly stand on it's own. Richard Brooks made an interesting arch nemesis, but the character of Judah Earl I found to be a little too self absorbed and narcissistic to really invest a great deal of focus on. Brooks's character was more interested in complete personal exaltation and fulfillment and less interested in a grander ethos, which made his motivations too one dimensional and clich&eacute; for me to be interested in. Brooks however did do well with the predictable character profile that he was provided by the writers - and I think that he pushed it as far as he could as a gifted actor. Mia Kirshner's character of Sarah, apparently the little girl from the original Crow film, was disappointing. The character of the child Sarah from the original Brandon Lee film was a tough kid that was practical, down to Earth, and that had a more pragmatic, everyday way of looking at things - while Mia Kirshner's Sarah was too vulnerable, creepy, and far too "witchy" to be believed as the adult extension of the original. Kirshner's character in this film would have been the last place that you would have expected the original character of Sarah to have ended up. It seemed to be a device created by the writers to over accentuate the occultism of the film - which was overkill and over saturating. My problem is not with Kirshner's performance, it was splendid - it was with the revised "update" of her character that deviated far too much from the personality of the original Sarah character that it undermined the character's continuity from the first film. All in all - not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better, had the film makers been more attentive to the defining elements of the original film, yet had taken the time to develop some of the characters better - and had deleted a few of the more derivative clich&eacute; character types and elements.

    I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them. First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying. The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected. I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them. What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.

    It takes off after about 20 minutes or so. Pretty much once we reach the hell ride there is a leap in quality that is of course overshadowed by the weaknesses of the scene which follows. I feel it's at about the point where he pulls out the deck of cards and the way he does it the film finally starts to fulfill expectations. Overall it's certainly worth watching but I do not challenge the dislike so many people have for it. When you watch it with an open mind, you can see about 20 minutes of footage needs to be cut, rewrote, reshot and maybe 5 or 10 minutes of footage added for story and character setup. I watch this movie once every couple years and each time I think omG this is BAD. Then as always, it gets better as the story continues not better each time you watch it. The fact is, they could have fixed everything wrong with it and it might have still been a box office disappointment. People wanted Brandon or at least an exact duplicate of the first in far too many respects for this B caliber sequel to get a chance. All that speculation cast aside, I still see the potential in this film that if explored properly, would have produced a sequel as amazing as the first. The soundtrack just wasn't there and the 20 minutes of turd needed to be cut, rewrote and reshot. It also doesn't help that the footage looks like it was shot on a high quality JVC commercial grade camcorder with the same texture as soap operas and low budget TV shows then some type of opaque effect added for a generic comic book feel. That says everything really. This was one of the first B-movies in many years to find it's way into the theater. That in itself is quite an achievement even though it's pretty common today. However, you'll find majority of the B-movies that followed it's coat tails into theaters were similar genre and visual style. It actually paved the door for a lot of the B-movies that squirmed their way into theaters from various genres, not just these dark fantasy action thrillers. For better or for worse, we now see a lot of B movies in theaters that are absolute garbage compared to this film.

    Everybody who saw "The Crow" (1994), a grisly but formulaic back-fr0m-the-dead revenge melodrama, knows actor Brandon Lee died from an accidental gunshot wound on the set during filming. Strangely enough, Lee's untimely demise boosted the box office appeal of "The Crow." The success prompted Miramax Pictures to release a sequel of sorts: "The Crow: City of Angels." Not only have the film producers replaced Lee with another actor, but they also have conjured up an entirely new character. Sequels typically fail to live up to the high standards of most original films, but "The Crow: City of Angels" proves the exception to the rule. The message of "The Crow: City of Angels," a nihilistic supernatural sadomasochistic saga, is that love is sometimes stronger than death. Nevertheless, love takes a backseat to violence in this expressionistic follow-up to the ill-fated but financially successful original. Instead, the filmmakers aim their cameras like guns at the more unsavory narrative elements: brutal murders and echoes of deviant sexual practices with an incidental node to the love aspect. The premise of the first "Crow" reechoes throughout the sequel. When somebody dies, a crow carries the soul to the land of the dead. Occasionally, something so horrible occurs that a soul can find no rest. In such a case, the crow leads the soul back to the living so that injustices can be resolved. David Goyer, who penned the original "Crow," tinkers rather than tampers with the surefire formula that yielded a $50 million haul at the box office. A cadaverous hero rises from the grave and destroys a depraved gang of low-life hemorrhoids. In "The Crow: City of Angels," a twenty-something auto mechanic, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez of "Queen Margot"), and his young son Danny (Eric Acosta of "Cheerleader Massacre 2") witness a gangland execution by a drug kingpin called Judah. The setting has been changed from the Motor City to the City of Angels. Instead of hoodlums celebrating Devil's Night, as in the original, here citizens participate in the Day of the Dead ceremonies designed to discourage departing spirits from lingering with the living. Eight years have elapsed since the first movie, and Sarah (Mia Kirshner of "Not Another Teen Movie") is the only hold-over character from the original. Sarah has grown up, moved to Los Angeles, and now runs a tattoo parlor. Sarah has been having nightmares lately, about a double homicide. A crow flies into her apartment, and she follows it to the harbor where the bodies of Ash and his son were dumped. The crow revives Ashe, and he emerges in a frothy fountain of bubbles before Sarah's eyes. When Ashe embarks on his revenge, Sarah paints his face in the same Harlequin pattern as Eric Draven's from the first film. Only this time, she uses Ashe's dead son's paints, giving it a truly symbolic meaning. Ashe begins knocking off Judah's (Richard Brooks) henchmen, working his way, as he calls it "up the food chain" to Judah himself. The villains comprise an undeniably loathsome bunch. You'd certainly never invite these scumbags home to meet your parents. Curve, (plug-ugly Iggy Pop of "Tank Girl") resembles death warmed over, while a dark smooth-skinned Richard Brooks as Judah presents a commanding presence. The drug dealing merchant of pain here is so repellent that he display little remorse when a poorly mixed batch of his own narcotics kills his customers. Every time one of these reptilian characters dies, the image of a crow appears around him. For example, when Ashe pitches one baddie from a window, the blood from the dead person's head coagulates in a puddle shaped like a crow. Compared with the first film, "City of Angels" isn't as violent. There is nothing here that comes off as violent as the table scene where Brandon Lee's Eric Draven got blasted by a barrage of gunfire. French heartthrob Vincent Perez animates his slain avenger with a Gallic exuberance. Perez's performance also conveys a quality that makes his character vulnerable and at the same time somewhat melancholy because he is deprived of life. Ashe reveals his reluctance to Sarah to blindly adhere to the fix path that fate has paved for him. Audiences learn the bare minimum about him. All we know about his wife is that she abounded him and their son after she became a drug addict. Unlike Eric Draven, Ashe's body doesn't erase the signs of violence. Gunshot wounds don't magically vanish. He spends more time tooling about on his motorcycle in search of felons and he never carries the crow around on his shoulder. Goyer's episodic script resembles a formula Republic serial from the 1940s. A mysterious hero enters a destitute city and topples a tyrant. Compared with the longer original film, "City of Angels" amounts to a severely pared down exercise in minimalism. The filmmakers have sacrificed exposition, which would clarify characters and story, for supercharged, headlong momentum. If you're looking for exposition, try the web site for "The Crow: City of Angels," because only the most essential information for pushing the plot forward remains in the film. Goyer and director Tim Pope keep the narrative simple, the characters shallow, and the story free from complications or digressive sub-plots. Extraneous characters, such as Ernie Hudson's cop from the first "Crow" don't clutter up the storyline. "The Crow: City of Angels" marks the motion picture debut of music-video director Tim Pope. Previously, Pope helmed music videos for Paul McCartney, Iggy Pop, Queen, and David Bowie. Pope clearly draws on his background so that his "Crow" boasts a fast-paced, no-nonsense, imagine intensive appearance. The film possesses a murky, Gothic look. Smoke swirls around the different bombed-out nocturnal settings, and Pope bathes different scenes in harsh, abrasive color schemes. The wide-angled point of view shots from the perspective of the craw have an avant-garde quality. You don't need to have seen "The Crow" to appreciate "The Crow: City of Angeles."

    The Crow: City of Angels (1996) * 1/2 (out of 4) A vicious drug dealer (Richard Brooks) has mechanic Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) killed along with his wife and young son. A year later the crow leads the mechanic back from the dead for revenge. Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination. The lack of imagination is something that can be said about the majority of this film as this sequel just never gets off the ground.

    Ah, 1996's "The Crow: City of Angels"- the first sequel in the downfall of a once-promising franchise. Directed by Tim Pope and written by David S. Goyer (whom both went on to disown the film due to studio re-edits that destroyed it), this is the tragic misstep that destroyed the series after the incredible 1994 debut. Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man whom was murdered, along with his child, after witnessing a gang-related hit. Some time later (it's never exactly established, but I think it's a short time later), Ashe is brought back by the power of a crow, to seek vengeance. He is helped along the way by Sarah... yes, the same Sarah from the first film, now all grown up and quite stunning (portrayed by the sexy Mia Kirshner). She uses Eric Draven's influence on her to paint the iconic crow makeup onto Ashe and send him on his way, also acting as a slight love interest in the rushed narrative. Ashe is after Judah (Richard Brooks), the drug lord of Los Angelas, who is sort of responsible for the loss of his own life and that of his child. Judah's men (including Thomas Jane, Iggy Pop and the late and great Thuy Trang) are the ones who murdered him. Through a bizarre series of events that just don't "gel" together properly, Judah forms a plan to steal the powers of the crow to make himself invincible, and Ashe must stop him at all costs. To give credit where it is due, there are some good aspects to the film. For starters, Pope's direction is quite nice, on the whole. He went for what seems to be the exact opposite of what Alex Proyas did with the first film. The movie is all in shades of red, orange, purple, etc. It's much harsher and more angry, and camera-work is generally good. Graeme Revell also returns to score the film, and he utilizes a fantastic combination of new themes with musical cues from the prior film. It helps ground them both in the same universe. And the performances aren't bad. However, it stops there. The films really, truly suffers from the studio re-edits. Rumor has it that the original cut of the film was much longer and significantly different, but Miramax, wanting to cash in on the success of the first film, had more than an hour of footage cut, and many scenes re-arranged in the narrative, in order to make it more like the original. And it shows. The pacing is sloppy and characters are left completely undeveloped. In addition, the tragedy and connection to the characters is also severed, and the ending (without spoiling anything) makes no sense whatsoever. The film feels like it's missing the backbone to the story, and what's left after these studio edits feels like an empty shell. It's barely watchable as-is, and isn't very enjoyable. Here's to hoping that one day, we may get the original cut of the film (which isn't the DVD Director's Cut, don't be fooled), and see this film in the best possible way, as the original cut does sound far superior. As it stands, "The Crow: City of Angels" gets a 3 out of 10. It's a worse version of the original film, and should be skipped over by all but die-hard fans who feel they need to see it.

    naturally this movie was not going to live up to the original which is a classic. But, it has its good points. the set up was done well with the murder of the man and son enhanced by good cinematography. I also think the landscape was done well creating a post apocalyptic feel. i think in my eyes the best scene was when the crow retrieves his son from the river and buries him which was enhanced by music from the original crow(best scene id say). the bad points for me was character based, the crow's dialogue and witty remarks i found were not effective. the villains (besides Iggy pop who i think did well) were portrayed weak and not in depth. Main bad point for me was a real weak ending where the crow summons crows to fly through him and destroy the immortal bad guy. thought that was i really poor written ending. I suppose as this was a sequel they couldn't make the concept as subtle as the first one without completely replicating it. still it was enjoyable to watch again after 14 years. probably wont be watching any time soon again tho. oh and at least it didn't have Tara Reid

    Some time ago, Ashe Corven and his son Danny were killed when they stumbled across a pack of drug dealers murdering a fellow dealer. The dealers work for Los Angeles drug kingpin Judah. Local tattoo artist Sarah, who has great knowledge of the crow legend because of what happened with her late friend, has been having dreams about Ashe and Danny. One night when a crow leads her to the scene of the murders of Ashe and Danny, Ashe appears before her. The crow has resurrected Ashe, so Ashe can go after Judah and his right hand man Curve. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing off Judah's men one by one, on his way to Judah. Yes, many think that this film is sacrilege and trounces on Lees grave, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel, very dark, and seems very visceral at times. I love the first movie, it has that tone to it and obviously what happened to Lee makes the film more poignant and essential. It was inevitable that there was going to be a sequel as the film shouts our franchise, whether you like it or not. Perez is obviously no Lee, but he wasn't supposed to be, he is his own 'Crow' ans this film has more of a paternal feel to it, rather than the dark romanticism of the first. And this is where the film usurps the first, the villains in this are more entertaining, even if they are over the top and more theatrical. Judah though, isn't a patch on Top Dollar, but has some good scenes and hilarious dialogue. So all in all it's a sequel, but a heavily underrated one, thanks to obsessed fans of the first who dismissed this. The set pieces are great, the soundtrack as dark as the first, and a whole 'dusk' vibe throughout the whole movie. It's obviously directed by a music video director, as the editing is sharp and some of the cinematography is stark. It's okay to say that this movie is good, you won't offend anyone, or lose the mysticism of the original.

    I wish you could give negative ratings. This is awful, a film without redeeming features. Let's list them. Story - 100% copy Bad Guy - Pathetic Good Guy - An shambolic shadow of Eric Draven Aesthetics - not sure was too dark to see anything. The Crow is one of a few films I would give 10/10 to. As such it is obviously one of my all time favourites. This is my actual least fave film and it includes films I couldn't watch in their entirety such as the original Re-Hash of The Hulk or recently Barbarossa! There is no reason at all to watch this film. it's not camp and therefore funny. It is not ironic, self deprecating or even a decent stand alone flick. Its appalling. Watch something else

    To be honest, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. The visuals are amazing, and the city feels fleshed out. It really feels like you're in a drug infested Los Angeles in the middle of the 90's, something the first film achieved greatly. They didn't go cheesy with this movie as much as they did the titles that followed it (with Ed Furlong and the other guy), but people still see it as a remake. It's actually a sequel, with a more pure love in my opinion than the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, try to watch it with an open mind. Vincent Perez does a great job as the lead role, and completely steals the spotlight from everyone else in the film. It's worth watching for him alone.

    I gave this sequel seven stars because, despite the fact that this film has some problems, it's still a good popcorn pusher - and there are worse ways to waste over an hour of your precious mortal life span. It's not Oscar material - but it's OK. Some parts were even emotionally satisfying. I liked Vincent Perez in the title role. He brought an interesting level of maturity to the character, and the fact that he was not playing a natively born American Crow gave a new sense of cosmic universality to the concept of the possessing avenging spirit that is the Crow character essentially. Although I liked the plot twist that the Crow was avenging his child as opposed to a wife or lover because it gave the film somewhat of a different, more "across the board" emotional relatability, I still felt that about 70% of the film was a template derivative of the original, with far too many common elements to fully assert it's expectations to truly stand on it's own. Richard Brooks made an interesting arch nemesis, but the character of Judah Earl I found to be a little too self absorbed and narcissistic to really invest a great deal of focus on. Brooks's character was more interested in complete personal exaltation and fulfillment and less interested in a grander ethos, which made his motivations too one dimensional and clich&eacute; for me to be interested in. Brooks however did do well with the predictable character profile that he was provided by the writers - and I think that he pushed it as far as he could as a gifted actor. Mia Kirshner's character of Sarah, apparently the little girl from the original Crow film, was disappointing. The character of the child Sarah from the original Brandon Lee film was a tough kid that was practical, down to Earth, and that had a more pragmatic, everyday way of looking at things - while Mia Kirshner's Sarah was too vulnerable, creepy, and far too "witchy" to be believed as the adult extension of the original. Kirshner's character in this film would have been the last place that you would have expected the original character of Sarah to have ended up. It seemed to be a device created by the writers to over accentuate the occultism of the film - which was overkill and over saturating. My problem is not with Kirshner's performance, it was splendid - it was with the revised "update" of her character that deviated far too much from the personality of the original Sarah character that it undermined the character's continuity from the first film. All in all - not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better, had the film makers been more attentive to the defining elements of the original film, yet had taken the time to develop some of the characters better - and had deleted a few of the more derivative clich&eacute; character types and elements.

    I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them. First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying. The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected. I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them. What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.

    It takes off after about 20 minutes or so. Pretty much once we reach the hell ride there is a leap in quality that is of course overshadowed by the weaknesses of the scene which follows. I feel it's at about the point where he pulls out the deck of cards and the way he does it the film finally starts to fulfill expectations. Overall it's certainly worth watching but I do not challenge the dislike so many people have for it. When you watch it with an open mind, you can see about 20 minutes of footage needs to be cut, rewrote, reshot and maybe 5 or 10 minutes of footage added for story and character setup. I watch this movie once every couple years and each time I think omG this is BAD. Then as always, it gets better as the story continues not better each time you watch it. The fact is, they could have fixed everything wrong with it and it might have still been a box office disappointment. People wanted Brandon or at least an exact duplicate of the first in far too many respects for this B caliber sequel to get a chance. All that speculation cast aside, I still see the potential in this film that if explored properly, would have produced a sequel as amazing as the first. The soundtrack just wasn't there and the 20 minutes of turd needed to be cut, rewrote and reshot. It also doesn't help that the footage looks like it was shot on a high quality JVC commercial grade camcorder with the same texture as soap operas and low budget TV shows then some type of opaque effect added for a generic comic book feel. That says everything really. This was one of the first B-movies in many years to find it's way into the theater. That in itself is quite an achievement even though it's pretty common today. However, you'll find majority of the B-movies that followed it's coat tails into theaters were similar genre and visual style. It actually paved the door for a lot of the B-movies that squirmed their way into theaters from various genres, not just these dark fantasy action thrillers. For better or for worse, we now see a lot of B movies in theaters that are absolute garbage compared to this film.

    Everybody who saw "The Crow" (1994), a grisly but formulaic back-fr0m-the-dead revenge melodrama, knows actor Brandon Lee died from an accidental gunshot wound on the set during filming. Strangely enough, Lee's untimely demise boosted the box office appeal of "The Crow." The success prompted Miramax Pictures to release a sequel of sorts: "The Crow: City of Angels." Not only have the film producers replaced Lee with another actor, but they also have conjured up an entirely new character. Sequels typically fail to live up to the high standards of most original films, but "The Crow: City of Angels" proves the exception to the rule. The message of "The Crow: City of Angels," a nihilistic supernatural sadomasochistic saga, is that love is sometimes stronger than death. Nevertheless, love takes a backseat to violence in this expressionistic follow-up to the ill-fated but financially successful original. Instead, the filmmakers aim their cameras like guns at the more unsavory narrative elements: brutal murders and echoes of deviant sexual practices with an incidental node to the love aspect. The premise of the first "Crow" reechoes throughout the sequel. When somebody dies, a crow carries the soul to the land of the dead. Occasionally, something so horrible occurs that a soul can find no rest. In such a case, the crow leads the soul back to the living so that injustices can be resolved. David Goyer, who penned the original "Crow," tinkers rather than tampers with the surefire formula that yielded a $50 million haul at the box office. A cadaverous hero rises from the grave and destroys a depraved gang of low-life hemorrhoids. In "The Crow: City of Angels," a twenty-something auto mechanic, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez of "Queen Margot"), and his young son Danny (Eric Acosta of "Cheerleader Massacre 2") witness a gangland execution by a drug kingpin called Judah. The setting has been changed from the Motor City to the City of Angels. Instead of hoodlums celebrating Devil's Night, as in the original, here citizens participate in the Day of the Dead ceremonies designed to discourage departing spirits from lingering with the living. Eight years have elapsed since the first movie, and Sarah (Mia Kirshner of "Not Another Teen Movie") is the only hold-over character from the original. Sarah has grown up, moved to Los Angeles, and now runs a tattoo parlor. Sarah has been having nightmares lately, about a double homicide. A crow flies into her apartment, and she follows it to the harbor where the bodies of Ash and his son were dumped. The crow revives Ashe, and he emerges in a frothy fountain of bubbles before Sarah's eyes. When Ashe embarks on his revenge, Sarah paints his face in the same Harlequin pattern as Eric Draven's from the first film. Only this time, she uses Ashe's dead son's paints, giving it a truly symbolic meaning. Ashe begins knocking off Judah's (Richard Brooks) henchmen, working his way, as he calls it "up the food chain" to Judah himself. The villains comprise an undeniably loathsome bunch. You'd certainly never invite these scumbags home to meet your parents. Curve, (plug-ugly Iggy Pop of "Tank Girl") resembles death warmed over, while a dark smooth-skinned Richard Brooks as Judah presents a commanding presence. The drug dealing merchant of pain here is so repellent that he display little remorse when a poorly mixed batch of his own narcotics kills his customers. Every time one of these reptilian characters dies, the image of a crow appears around him. For example, when Ashe pitches one baddie from a window, the blood from the dead person's head coagulates in a puddle shaped like a crow. Compared with the first film, "City of Angels" isn't as violent. There is nothing here that comes off as violent as the table scene where Brandon Lee's Eric Draven got blasted by a barrage of gunfire. French heartthrob Vincent Perez animates his slain avenger with a Gallic exuberance. Perez's performance also conveys a quality that makes his character vulnerable and at the same time somewhat melancholy because he is deprived of life. Ashe reveals his reluctance to Sarah to blindly adhere to the fix path that fate has paved for him. Audiences learn the bare minimum about him. All we know about his wife is that she abounded him and their son after she became a drug addict. Unlike Eric Draven, Ashe's body doesn't erase the signs of violence. Gunshot wounds don't magically vanish. He spends more time tooling about on his motorcycle in search of felons and he never carries the crow around on his shoulder. Goyer's episodic script resembles a formula Republic serial from the 1940s. A mysterious hero enters a destitute city and topples a tyrant. Compared with the longer original film, "City of Angels" amounts to a severely pared down exercise in minimalism. The filmmakers have sacrificed exposition, which would clarify characters and story, for supercharged, headlong momentum. If you're looking for exposition, try the web site for "The Crow: City of Angels," because only the most essential information for pushing the plot forward remains in the film. Goyer and director Tim Pope keep the narrative simple, the characters shallow, and the story free from complications or digressive sub-plots. Extraneous characters, such as Ernie Hudson's cop from the first "Crow" don't clutter up the storyline. "The Crow: City of Angels" marks the motion picture debut of music-video director Tim Pope. Previously, Pope helmed music videos for Paul McCartney, Iggy Pop, Queen, and David Bowie. Pope clearly draws on his background so that his "Crow" boasts a fast-paced, no-nonsense, imagine intensive appearance. The film possesses a murky, Gothic look. Smoke swirls around the different bombed-out nocturnal settings, and Pope bathes different scenes in harsh, abrasive color schemes. The wide-angled point of view shots from the perspective of the craw have an avant-garde quality. You don't need to have seen "The Crow" to appreciate "The Crow: City of Angeles."

    The Crow: City of Angels (1996) * 1/2 (out of 4) A vicious drug dealer (Richard Brooks) has mechanic Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) killed along with his wife and young son. A year later the crow leads the mechanic back from the dead for revenge. Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination. The lack of imagination is something that can be said about the majority of this film as this sequel just never gets off the ground.

    Ah, 1996's "The Crow: City of Angels"- the first sequel in the downfall of a once-promising franchise. Directed by Tim Pope and written by David S. Goyer (whom both went on to disown the film due to studio re-edits that destroyed it), this is the tragic misstep that destroyed the series after the incredible 1994 debut. Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man whom was murdered, along with his child, after witnessing a gang-related hit. Some time later (it's never exactly established, but I think it's a short time later), Ashe is brought back by the power of a crow, to seek vengeance. He is helped along the way by Sarah... yes, the same Sarah from the first film, now all grown up and quite stunning (portrayed by the sexy Mia Kirshner). She uses Eric Draven's influence on her to paint the iconic crow makeup onto Ashe and send him on his way, also acting as a slight love interest in the rushed narrative. Ashe is after Judah (Richard Brooks), the drug lord of Los Angelas, who is sort of responsible for the loss of his own life and that of his child. Judah's men (including Thomas Jane, Iggy Pop and the late and great Thuy Trang) are the ones who murdered him. Through a bizarre series of events that just don't "gel" together properly, Judah forms a plan to steal the powers of the crow to make himself invincible, and Ashe must stop him at all costs. To give credit where it is due, there are some good aspects to the film. For starters, Pope's direction is quite nice, on the whole. He went for what seems to be the exact opposite of what Alex Proyas did with the first film. The movie is all in shades of red, orange, purple, etc. It's much harsher and more angry, and camera-work is generally good. Graeme Revell also returns to score the film, and he utilizes a fantastic combination of new themes with musical cues from the prior film. It helps ground them both in the same universe. And the performances aren't bad. However, it stops there. The films really, truly suffers from the studio re-edits. Rumor has it that the original cut of the film was much longer and significantly different, but Miramax, wanting to cash in on the success of the first film, had more than an hour of footage cut, and many scenes re-arranged in the narrative, in order to make it more like the original. And it shows. The pacing is sloppy and characters are left completely undeveloped. In addition, the tragedy and connection to the characters is also severed, and the ending (without spoiling anything) makes no sense whatsoever. The film feels like it's missing the backbone to the story, and what's left after these studio edits feels like an empty shell. It's barely watchable as-is, and isn't very enjoyable. Here's to hoping that one day, we may get the original cut of the film (which isn't the DVD Director's Cut, don't be fooled), and see this film in the best possible way, as the original cut does sound far superior. As it stands, "The Crow: City of Angels" gets a 3 out of 10. It's a worse version of the original film, and should be skipped over by all but die-hard fans who feel they need to see it.

    naturally this movie was not going to live up to the original which is a classic. But, it has its good points. the set up was done well with the murder of the man and son enhanced by good cinematography. I also think the landscape was done well creating a post apocalyptic feel. i think in my eyes the best scene was when the crow retrieves his son from the river and buries him which was enhanced by music from the original crow(best scene id say). the bad points for me was character based, the crow's dialogue and witty remarks i found were not effective. the villains (besides Iggy pop who i think did well) were portrayed weak and not in depth. Main bad point for me was a real weak ending where the crow summons crows to fly through him and destroy the immortal bad guy. thought that was i really poor written ending. I suppose as this was a sequel they couldn't make the concept as subtle as the first one without completely replicating it. still it was enjoyable to watch again after 14 years. probably wont be watching any time soon again tho. oh and at least it didn't have Tara Reid

    Some time ago, Ashe Corven and his son Danny were killed when they stumbled across a pack of drug dealers murdering a fellow dealer. The dealers work for Los Angeles drug kingpin Judah. Local tattoo artist Sarah, who has great knowledge of the crow legend because of what happened with her late friend, has been having dreams about Ashe and Danny. One night when a crow leads her to the scene of the murders of Ashe and Danny, Ashe appears before her. The crow has resurrected Ashe, so Ashe can go after Judah and his right hand man Curve. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing off Judah's men one by one, on his way to Judah. Yes, many think that this film is sacrilege and trounces on Lees grave, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel, very dark, and seems very visceral at times. I love the first movie, it has that tone to it and obviously what happened to Lee makes the film more poignant and essential. It was inevitable that there was going to be a sequel as the film shouts our franchise, whether you like it or not. Perez is obviously no Lee, but he wasn't supposed to be, he is his own 'Crow' ans this film has more of a paternal feel to it, rather than the dark romanticism of the first. And this is where the film usurps the first, the villains in this are more entertaining, even if they are over the top and more theatrical. Judah though, isn't a patch on Top Dollar, but has some good scenes and hilarious dialogue. So all in all it's a sequel, but a heavily underrated one, thanks to obsessed fans of the first who dismissed this. The set pieces are great, the soundtrack as dark as the first, and a whole 'dusk' vibe throughout the whole movie. It's obviously directed by a music video director, as the editing is sharp and some of the cinematography is stark. It's okay to say that this movie is good, you won't offend anyone, or lose the mysticism of the original.

    I wish you could give negative ratings. This is awful, a film without redeeming features. Let's list them. Story - 100% copy Bad Guy - Pathetic Good Guy - An shambolic shadow of Eric Draven Aesthetics - not sure was too dark to see anything. The Crow is one of a few films I would give 10/10 to. As such it is obviously one of my all time favourites. This is my actual least fave film and it includes films I couldn't watch in their entirety such as the original Re-Hash of The Hulk or recently Barbarossa! There is no reason at all to watch this film. it's not camp and therefore funny. It is not ironic, self deprecating or even a decent stand alone flick. Its appalling. Watch something else

    To be honest, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. The visuals are amazing, and the city feels fleshed out. It really feels like you're in a drug infested Los Angeles in the middle of the 90's, something the first film achieved greatly. They didn't go cheesy with this movie as much as they did the titles that followed it (with Ed Furlong and the other guy), but people still see it as a remake. It's actually a sequel, with a more pure love in my opinion than the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, try to watch it with an open mind. Vincent Perez does a great job as the lead role, and completely steals the spotlight from everyone else in the film. It's worth watching for him alone.

    I gave this sequel seven stars because, despite the fact that this film has some problems, it's still a good popcorn pusher - and there are worse ways to waste over an hour of your precious mortal life span. It's not Oscar material - but it's OK. Some parts were even emotionally satisfying. I liked Vincent Perez in the title role. He brought an interesting level of maturity to the character, and the fact that he was not playing a natively born American Crow gave a new sense of cosmic universality to the concept of the possessing avenging spirit that is the Crow character essentially. Although I liked the plot twist that the Crow was avenging his child as opposed to a wife or lover because it gave the film somewhat of a different, more "across the board" emotional relatability, I still felt that about 70% of the film was a template derivative of the original, with far too many common elements to fully assert it's expectations to truly stand on it's own. Richard Brooks made an interesting arch nemesis, but the character of Judah Earl I found to be a little too self absorbed and narcissistic to really invest a great deal of focus on. Brooks's character was more interested in complete personal exaltation and fulfillment and less interested in a grander ethos, which made his motivations too one dimensional and clich&eacute; for me to be interested in. Brooks however did do well with the predictable character profile that he was provided by the writers - and I think that he pushed it as far as he could as a gifted actor. Mia Kirshner's character of Sarah, apparently the little girl from the original Crow film, was disappointing. The character of the child Sarah from the original Brandon Lee film was a tough kid that was practical, down to Earth, and that had a more pragmatic, everyday way of looking at things - while Mia Kirshner's Sarah was too vulnerable, creepy, and far too "witchy" to be believed as the adult extension of the original. Kirshner's character in this film would have been the last place that you would have expected the original character of Sarah to have ended up. It seemed to be a device created by the writers to over accentuate the occultism of the film - which was overkill and over saturating. My problem is not with Kirshner's performance, it was splendid - it was with the revised "update" of her character that deviated far too much from the personality of the original Sarah character that it undermined the character's continuity from the first film. All in all - not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better, had the film makers been more attentive to the defining elements of the original film, yet had taken the time to develop some of the characters better - and had deleted a few of the more derivative clich&eacute; character types and elements.

    I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them. First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying. The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected. I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them. What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.

    It takes off after about 20 minutes or so. Pretty much once we reach the hell ride there is a leap in quality that is of course overshadowed by the weaknesses of the scene which follows. I feel it's at about the point where he pulls out the deck of cards and the way he does it the film finally starts to fulfill expectations. Overall it's certainly worth watching but I do not challenge the dislike so many people have for it. When you watch it with an open mind, you can see about 20 minutes of footage needs to be cut, rewrote, reshot and maybe 5 or 10 minutes of footage added for story and character setup. I watch this movie once every couple years and each time I think omG this is BAD. Then as always, it gets better as the story continues not better each time you watch it.

    Everybody who saw "The Crow" (1994), a grisly but formulaic back-fr0m-the-dead revenge melodrama, knows actor Brandon Lee died from an accidental gunshot wound on the set during filming. Strangely enough, Lee's untimely demise boosted the box office appeal of "The Crow." The success prompted Miramax Pictures to release a sequel of sorts: "The Crow: City of Angels." Not only have the film producers replaced Lee with another actor, but they also have conjured up an entirely new character. Sequels typically fail to live up to the high standards of most original films, but "The Crow: City of Angels" proves the exception to the rule. The message of "The Crow: City of Angels," a nihilistic supernatural sadomasochistic saga, is that love is sometimes stronger than death. Nevertheless, love takes a backseat to violence in this expressionistic follow-up to the ill-fated but financially successful original. Instead, the filmmakers aim their cameras like guns at the more unsavory narrative elements: brutal murders and echoes of deviant sexual practices with an incidental node to the love aspect. The premise of the first "Crow" reechoes throughout the sequel. When somebody dies, a crow carries the soul to the land of the dead. Occasionally, something so horrible occurs that a soul can find no rest. In such a case, the crow leads the soul back to the living so that injustices can be resolved. David Goyer, who penned the original "Crow," tinkers rather than tampers with the surefire formula that yielded a $50 million haul at the box office. A cadaverous hero rises from the grave and destroys a depraved gang of low-life hemorrhoids. In "The Crow: City of Angels," a twenty-something auto mechanic, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez of "Queen Margot"), and his young son Danny (Eric Acosta of "Cheerleader Massacre 2") witness a gangland execution by a drug kingpin called Judah. The setting has been changed from the Motor City to the City of Angels. Instead of hoodlums celebrating Devil's Night, as in the original, here citizens participate in the Day of the Dead ceremonies designed to discourage departing spirits from lingering with the living. Eight years have elapsed since the first movie, and Sarah (Mia Kirshner of "Not Another Teen Movie") is the only hold-over character from the original. Sarah has grown up, moved to Los Angeles, and now runs a tattoo parlor. Sarah has been having nightmares lately, about a double homicide. A crow flies into her apartment, and she follows it to the harbor where the bodies of Ash and his son were dumped. The crow revives Ashe, and he emerges in a frothy fountain of bubbles before Sarah's eyes. When Ashe embarks on his revenge, Sarah paints his face in the same Harlequin pattern as Eric Draven's from the first film. Only this time, she uses Ashe's dead son's paints, giving it a truly symbolic meaning. Ashe begins knocking off Judah's (Richard Brooks) henchmen, working his way, as he calls it "up the food chain" to Judah himself. The villains comprise an undeniably loathsome bunch. You'd certainly never invite these scumbags home to meet your parents. Curve, (plug-ugly Iggy Pop of "Tank Girl") resembles death warmed over, while a dark smooth-skinned Richard Brooks as Judah presents a commanding presence. The drug dealing merchant of pain here is so repellent that he display little remorse when a poorly mixed batch of his own narcotics kills his customers. Every time one of these reptilian characters dies, the image of a crow appears around him. For example, when Ashe pitches one baddie from a window, the blood from the dead person's head coagulates in a puddle shaped like a crow. Compared with the first film, "City of Angels" isn't as violent. There is nothing here that comes off as violent as the table scene where Brandon Lee's Eric Draven got blasted by a barrage of gunfire. French heartthrob Vincent Perez animates his slain avenger with a Gallic exuberance. Perez's performance also conveys a quality that makes his character vulnerable and at the same time somewhat melancholy because he is deprived of life. Ashe reveals his reluctance to Sarah to blindly adhere to the fix path that fate has paved for him. Audiences learn the bare minimum about him. All we know about his wife is that she abounded him and their son after she became a drug addict. Unlike Eric Draven, Ashe's body doesn't erase the signs of violence. Gunshot wounds don't magically vanish. He spends more time tooling about on his motorcycle in search of felons and he never carries the crow around on his shoulder. Goyer's episodic script resembles a formula Republic serial from the 1940s. A mysterious hero enters a destitute city and topples a tyrant. Compared with the longer original film, "City of Angels" amounts to a severely pared down exercise in minimalism. The filmmakers have sacrificed exposition, which would clarify characters and story, for supercharged, headlong momentum. If you're looking for exposition, try the web site for "The Crow: City of Angels," because only the most essential information for pushing the plot forward remains in the film. Goyer and director Tim Pope keep the narrative simple, the characters shallow, and the story free from complications or digressive sub-plots. Extraneous characters, such as Ernie Hudson's cop from the first "Crow" don't clutter up the storyline. "The Crow: City of Angels" marks the motion picture debut of music-video director Tim Pope. Previously, Pope helmed music videos for Paul McCartney, Iggy Pop, Queen, and David Bowie. Pope clearly draws on his background so that his "Crow" boasts a fast-paced, no-nonsense, imagine intensive appearance. The film possesses a murky, Gothic look. Smoke swirls around the different bombed-out nocturnal settings, and Pope bathes different scenes in harsh, abrasive color schemes. The wide-angled point of view shots from the perspective of the craw have an avant-garde quality. You don't need to have seen "The Crow" to appreciate "The Crow: City of Angeles."

    The Crow: City of Angels (1996) * 1/2 (out of 4) A vicious drug dealer (Richard Brooks) has mechanic Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) killed along with his wife and young son. A year later the crow leads the mechanic back from the dead for revenge. Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination. The lack of imagination is something that can be said about the majority of this film as this sequel just never gets off the ground.

    Ah, 1996's "The Crow: City of Angels"- the first sequel in the downfall of a once-promising franchise. Directed by Tim Pope and written by David S. Goyer (whom both went on to disown the film due to studio re-edits that destroyed it), this is the tragic misstep that destroyed the series after the incredible 1994 debut. Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man whom was murdered, along with his child, after witnessing a gang-related hit. Some time later (it's never exactly established, but I think it's a short time later), Ashe is brought back by the power of a crow, to seek vengeance. He is helped along the way by Sarah... yes, the same Sarah from the first film, now all grown up and quite stunning (portrayed by the sexy Mia Kirshner). She uses Eric Draven's influence on her to paint the iconic crow makeup onto Ashe and send him on his way, also acting as a slight love interest in the rushed narrative. Ashe is after Judah (Richard Brooks), the drug lord of Los Angelas, who is sort of responsible for the loss of his own life and that of his child. Judah's men (including Thomas Jane, Iggy Pop and the late and great Thuy Trang) are the ones who murdered him. Through a bizarre series of events that just don't "gel" together properly, Judah forms a plan to steal the powers of the crow to make himself invincible, and Ashe must stop him at all costs. To give credit where it is due, there are some good aspects to the film. For starters, Pope's direction is quite nice, on the whole. He went for what seems to be the exact opposite of what Alex Proyas did with the first film. The movie is all in shades of red, orange, purple, etc. It's much harsher and more angry, and camera-work is generally good. Graeme Revell also returns to score the film, and he utilizes a fantastic combination of new themes with musical cues from the prior film. It helps ground them both in the same universe. And the performances aren't bad. However, it stops there. The films really, truly suffers from the studio re-edits. Rumor has it that the original cut of the film was much longer and significantly different, but Miramax, wanting to cash in on the success of the first film, had more than an hour of footage cut, and many scenes re-arranged in the narrative, in order to make it more like the original. And it shows. The pacing is sloppy and characters are left completely undeveloped. In addition, the tragedy and connection to the characters is also severed, and the ending (without spoiling anything) makes no sense whatsoever. The film feels like it's missing the backbone to the story, and what's left after these studio edits feels like an empty shell. It's barely watchable as-is, and isn't very enjoyable. Here's to hoping that one day, we may get the original cut of the film (which isn't the DVD Director's Cut, don't be fooled), and see this film in the best possible way, as the original cut does sound far superior. As it stands, "The Crow: City of Angels" gets a 3 out of 10. It's a worse version of the original film, and should be skipped over by all but die-hard fans who feel they need to see it.

    naturally this movie was not going to live up to the original which is a classic. But, it has its good points. the set up was done well with the murder of the man and son enhanced by good cinematography. I also think the landscape was done well creating a post apocalyptic feel. i think in my eyes the best scene was when the crow retrieves his son from the river and buries him which was enhanced by music from the original crow(best scene id say). the bad points for me was character based, the crow's dialogue and witty remarks i found were not effective. the villains (besides Iggy pop who i think did well) were portrayed weak and not in depth. Main bad point for me was a real weak ending where the crow summons crows to fly through him and destroy the immortal bad guy. thought that was i really poor written ending. I suppose as this was a sequel they couldn't make the concept as subtle as the first one without completely replicating it. still it was enjoyable to watch again after 14 years. probably wont be watching any time soon again tho. oh and at least it didn't have Tara Reid

    Some time ago, Ashe Corven and his son Danny were killed when they stumbled across a pack of drug dealers murdering a fellow dealer. The dealers work for Los Angeles drug kingpin Judah. Local tattoo artist Sarah, who has great knowledge of the crow legend because of what happened with her late friend, has been having dreams about Ashe and Danny. One night when a crow leads her to the scene of the murders of Ashe and Danny, Ashe appears before her. The crow has resurrected Ashe, so Ashe can go after Judah and his right hand man Curve. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing off Judah's men one by one, on his way to Judah. Yes, many think that this film is sacrilege and trounces on Lees grave, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel, very dark, and seems very visceral at times. I love the first movie, it has that tone to it and obviously what happened to Lee makes the film more poignant and essential. It was inevitable that there was going to be a sequel as the film shouts our franchise, whether you like it or not. Perez is obviously no Lee, but he wasn't supposed to be, he is his own 'Crow' ans this film has more of a paternal feel to it, rather than the dark romanticism of the first. And this is where the film usurps the first, the villains in this are more entertaining, even if they are over the top and more theatrical. Judah though, isn't a patch on Top Dollar, but has some good scenes and hilarious dialogue. So all in all it's a sequel, but a heavily underrated one, thanks to obsessed fans of the first who dismissed this. The set pieces are great, the soundtrack as dark as the first, and a whole 'dusk' vibe throughout the whole movie. It's obviously directed by a music video director, as the editing is sharp and some of the cinematography is stark. It's okay to say that this movie is good, you won't offend anyone, or lose the mysticism of the original.

    I wish you could give negative ratings. This is awful, a film without redeeming features. Let's list them. Story - 100% copy Bad Guy - Pathetic Good Guy - An shambolic shadow of Eric Draven Aesthetics - not sure was too dark to see anything. The Crow is one of a few films I would give 10/10 to. As such it is obviously one of my all time favourites. This is my actual least fave film and it includes films I couldn't watch in their entirety such as the original Re-Hash of The Hulk or recently Barbarossa! There is no reason at all to watch this film. it's not camp and therefore funny. It is not ironic, self deprecating or even a decent stand alone flick. Its appalling. Watch something else

    To be honest, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. The visuals are amazing, and the city feels fleshed out. It really feels like you're in a drug infested Los Angeles in the middle of the 90's, something the first film achieved greatly. They didn't go cheesy with this movie as much as they did the titles that followed it (with Ed Furlong and the other guy), but people still see it as a remake. It's actually a sequel, with a more pure love in my opinion than the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, try to watch it with an open mind. Vincent Perez does a great job as the lead role, and completely steals the spotlight from everyone else in the film. It's worth watching for him alone.

    I gave this sequel seven stars because, despite the fact that this film has some problems, it's still a good popcorn pusher - and there are worse ways to waste over an hour of your precious mortal life span. It's not Oscar material - but it's OK. Some parts were even emotionally satisfying. I liked Vincent Perez in the title role. He brought an interesting level of maturity to the character, and the fact that he was not playing a natively born American Crow gave a new sense of cosmic universality to the concept of the possessing avenging spirit that is the Crow character essentially. Although I liked the plot twist that the Crow was avenging his child as opposed to a wife or lover because it gave the film somewhat of a different, more "across the board" emotional relatability, I still felt that about 70% of the film was a template derivative of the original, with far too many common elements to fully assert it's expectations to truly stand on it's own. Richard Brooks made an interesting arch nemesis, but the character of Judah Earl I found to be a little too self absorbed and narcissistic to really invest a great deal of focus on. Brooks's character was more interested in complete personal exaltation and fulfillment and less interested in a grander ethos, which made his motivations too one dimensional and clich&eacute; for me to be interested in. Brooks however did do well with the predictable character profile that he was provided by the writers - and I think that he pushed it as far as he could as a gifted actor. Mia Kirshner's character of Sarah, apparently the little girl from the original Crow film, was disappointing. The character of the child Sarah from the original Brandon Lee film was a tough kid that was practical, down to Earth, and that had a more pragmatic, everyday way of looking at things - while Mia Kirshner's Sarah was too vulnerable, creepy, and far too "witchy" to be believed as the adult extension of the original. Kirshner's character in this film would have been the last place that you would have expected the original character of Sarah to have ended up. It seemed to be a device created by the writers to over accentuate the occultism of the film - which was overkill and over saturating. My problem is not with Kirshner's performance, it was splendid - it was with the revised "update" of her character that deviated far too much from the personality of the original Sarah character that it undermined the character's continuity from the first film. All in all - not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better, had the film makers been more attentive to the defining elements of the original film, yet had taken the time to develop some of the characters better - and had deleted a few of the more derivative clich&eacute; character types and elements.

    I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them. First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying. The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected. I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them. What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.

    It takes off after about 20 minutes or so. Pretty much once we reach the hell ride there is a leap in quality that is of course overshadowed by the weaknesses of the scene which follows. I feel it's at about the point where he pulls out the deck of cards and the way he does it the film finally starts to fulfill expectations. Overall it's certainly worth watching but I do not challenge the dislike so many people have for it. When you watch it with an open mind, you can see about 20 minutes of footage needs to be cut, rewrote, reshot and maybe 5 or 10 minutes of footage added for story and character setup. I watch this movie once every couple years and each time I think omG this is BAD. Then as always, it gets better as the story continues not better each time you watch it. The fact is, they could have fixed everything wrong with it and it might have still been a box office disappointment. People wanted Brandon or at least an exact duplicate of the first in far too many respects for this B caliber sequel to get a chance. All that speculation cast aside, I still see the potential in this film that if explored properly, would have produced a sequel as amazing as the first. The soundtrack just wasn't there and the 20 minutes of turd needed to be cut, rewrote and reshot. It also doesn't help that the footage looks like it was shot on a high quality JVC commercial grade camcorder with the same texture as soap operas and low budget TV shows then some type of opaque effect added for a generic comic book feel. That says everything really. This was one of the first B-movies in many years to find it's way into the theater. That in itself is quite an achievement even though it's pretty common today. However, you'll find majority of the B-movies that followed it's coat tails into theaters were similar genre and visual style. It actually paved the door for a lot of the B-movies that squirmed their way into theaters from various genres, not just these dark fantasy action thrillers. For better or for worse, we now see a lot of B movies in theaters that are absolute garbage compared to this film.

    Everybody who saw "The Crow" (1994), a grisly but formulaic back-fr0m-the-dead revenge melodrama, knows actor Brandon Lee died from an accidental gunshot wound on the set during filming. Strangely enough, Lee's untimely demise boosted the box office appeal of "The Crow." The success prompted Miramax Pictures to release a sequel of sorts: "The Crow: City of Angels." Not only have the film producers replaced Lee with another actor, but they also have conjured up an entirely new character. Sequels typically fail to live up to the high standards of most original films, but "The Crow: City of Angels" proves the exception to the rule. The message of "The Crow: City of Angels," a nihilistic supernatural sadomasochistic saga, is that love is sometimes stronger than death. Nevertheless, love takes a backseat to violence in this expressionistic follow-up to the ill-fated but financially successful original. Instead, the filmmakers aim their cameras like guns at the more unsavory narrative elements: brutal murders and echoes of deviant sexual practices with an incidental node to the love aspect. The premise of the first "Crow" reechoes throughout the sequel. When somebody dies, a crow carries the soul to the land of the dead. Occasionally, something so horrible occurs that a soul can find no rest. In such a case, the crow leads the soul back to the living so that injustices can be resolved. David Goyer, who penned the original "Crow," tinkers rather than tampers with the surefire formula that yielded a $50 million haul at the box office. A cadaverous hero rises from the grave and destroys a depraved gang of low-life hemorrhoids. In "The Crow: City of Angels," a twenty-something auto mechanic, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez of "Queen Margot"), and his young son Danny (Eric Acosta of "Cheerleader Massacre 2") witness a gangland execution by a drug kingpin called Judah. The setting has been changed from the Motor City to the City of Angels. Instead of hoodlums celebrating Devil's Night, as in the original, here citizens participate in the Day of the Dead ceremonies designed to discourage departing spirits from lingering with the living. Eight years have elapsed since the first movie, and Sarah (Mia Kirshner of "Not Another Teen Movie") is the only hold-over character from the original. Sarah has grown up, moved to Los Angeles, and now runs a tattoo parlor. Sarah has been having nightmares lately, about a double homicide. A crow flies into her apartment, and she follows it to the harbor where the bodies of Ash and his son were dumped. The crow revives Ashe, and he emerges in a frothy fountain of bubbles before Sarah's eyes. When Ashe embarks on his revenge, Sarah paints his face in the same Harlequin pattern as Eric Draven's from the first film. Only this time, she uses Ashe's dead son's paints, giving it a truly symbolic meaning. Ashe begins knocking off Judah's (Richard Brooks) henchmen, working his way, as he calls it "up the food chain" to Judah himself. The villains comprise an undeniably loathsome bunch. You'd certainly never invite these scumbags home to meet your parents. Curve, (plug-ugly Iggy Pop of "Tank Girl") resembles death warmed over, while a dark smooth-skinned Richard Brooks as Judah presents a commanding presence. The drug dealing merchant of pain here is so repellent that he display little remorse when a poorly mixed batch of his own narcotics kills his customers. Every time one of these reptilian characters dies, the image of a crow appears around him. For example, when Ashe pitches one baddie from a window, the blood from the dead person's head coagulates in a puddle shaped like a crow. Compared with the first film, "City of Angels" isn't as violent. There is nothing here that comes off as violent as the table scene where Brandon Lee's Eric Draven got blasted by a barrage of gunfire. French heartthrob Vincent Perez animates his slain avenger with a Gallic exuberance. Perez's performance also conveys a quality that makes his character vulnerable and at the same time somewhat melancholy because he is deprived of life. Ashe reveals his reluctance to Sarah to blindly adhere to the fix path that fate has paved for him. Audiences learn the bare minimum about him. All we know about his wife is that she abounded him and their son after she became a drug addict. Unlike Eric Draven, Ashe's body doesn't erase the signs of violence. Gunshot wounds don't magically vanish. He spends more time tooling about on his motorcycle in search of felons and he never carries the crow around on his shoulder. Goyer's episodic script resembles a formula Republic serial from the 1940s. A mysterious hero enters a destitute city and topples a tyrant. Compared with the longer original film, "City of Angels" amounts to a severely pared down exercise in minimalism. The filmmakers have sacrificed exposition, which would clarify characters and story, for supercharged, headlong momentum. If you're looking for exposition, try the web site for "The Crow: City of Angels," because only the most essential information for pushing the plot forward remains in the film. Goyer and director Tim Pope keep the narrative simple, the characters shallow, and the story free from complications or digressive sub-plots. Extraneous characters, such as Ernie Hudson's cop from the first "Crow" don't clutter up the storyline. "The Crow: City of Angels" marks the motion picture debut of music-video director Tim Pope. Previously, Pope helmed music videos for Paul McCartney, Iggy Pop, Queen, and David Bowie. Pope clearly draws on his background so that his "Crow" boasts a fast-paced, no-nonsense, imagine intensive appearance. The film possesses a murky, Gothic look. Smoke swirls around the different bombed-out nocturnal settings, and Pope bathes different scenes in harsh, abrasive color schemes. The wide-angled point of view shots from the perspective of the craw have an avant-garde quality. You don't need to have seen "The Crow" to appreciate "The Crow: City of Angeles."

    The Crow: City of Angels (1996) * 1/2 (out of 4) A vicious drug dealer (Richard Brooks) has mechanic Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) killed along with his wife and young son. A year later the crow leads the mechanic back from the dead for revenge. Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination. The lack of imagination is something that can be said about the majority of this film as this sequel just never gets off the ground.

    Ah, 1996's "The Crow: City of Angels"- the first sequel in the downfall of a once-promising franchise. Directed by Tim Pope and written by David S. Goyer (whom both went on to disown the film due to studio re-edits that destroyed it), this is the tragic misstep that destroyed the series after the incredible 1994 debut. Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man whom was murdered, along with his child, after witnessing a gang-related hit. Some time later (it's never exactly established, but I think it's a short time later), Ashe is brought back by the power of a crow, to seek vengeance. He is helped along the way by Sarah... yes, the same Sarah from the first film, now all grown up and quite stunning (portrayed by the sexy Mia Kirshner). She uses Eric Draven's influence on her to paint the iconic crow makeup onto Ashe and send him on his way, also acting as a slight love interest in the rushed narrative. Ashe is after Judah (Richard Brooks), the drug lord of Los Angelas, who is sort of responsible for the loss of his own life and that of his child. Judah's men (including Thomas Jane, Iggy Pop and the late and great Thuy Trang) are the ones who murdered him. Through a bizarre series of events that just don't "gel" together properly, Judah forms a plan to steal the powers of the crow to make himself invincible, and Ashe must stop him at all costs. To give credit where it is due, there are some good aspects to the film. For starters, Pope's direction is quite nice, on the whole. He went for what seems to be the exact opposite of what Alex Proyas did with the first film. The movie is all in shades of red, orange, purple, etc. It's much harsher and more angry, and camera-work is generally good. Graeme Revell also returns to score the film, and he utilizes a fantastic combination of new themes with musical cues from the prior film. It helps ground them both in the same universe. And the performances aren't bad. However, it stops there. The films really, truly suffers from the studio re-edits. Rumor has it that the original cut of the film was much longer and significantly different, but Miramax, wanting to cash in on the success of the first film, had more than an hour of footage cut, and many scenes re-arranged in the narrative, in order to make it more like the original. And it shows. The pacing is sloppy and characters are left completely undeveloped. In addition, the tragedy and connection to the characters is also severed, and the ending (without spoiling anything) makes no sense whatsoever. The film feels like it's missing the backbone to the story, and what's left after these studio edits feels like an empty shell. It's barely watchable as-is, and isn't very enjoyable. Here's to hoping that one day, we may get the original cut of the film (which isn't the DVD Director's Cut, don't be fooled), and see this film in the best possible way, as the original cut does sound far superior. As it stands, "The Crow: City of Angels" gets a 3 out of 10. It's a worse version of the original film, and should be skipped over by all but die-hard fans who feel they need to see it.

    naturally this movie was not going to live up to the original which is a classic. But, it has its good points. the set up was done well with the murder of the man and son enhanced by good cinematography. I also think the landscape was done well creating a post apocalyptic feel. i think in my eyes the best scene was when the crow retrieves his son from the river and buries him which was enhanced by music from the original crow(best scene id say). the bad points for me was character based, the crow's dialogue and witty remarks i found were not effective. the villains (besides Iggy pop who i think did well) were portrayed weak and not in depth. Main bad point for me was a real weak ending where the crow summons crows to fly through him and destroy the immortal bad guy. thought that was i really poor written ending. I suppose as this was a sequel they couldn't make the concept as subtle as the first one without completely replicating it. still it was enjoyable to watch again after 14 years. probably wont be watching any time soon again tho. oh and at least it didn't have Tara Reid

    Some time ago, Ashe Corven and his son Danny were killed when they stumbled across a pack of drug dealers murdering a fellow dealer. The dealers work for Los Angeles drug kingpin Judah. Local tattoo artist Sarah, who has great knowledge of the crow legend because of what happened with her late friend, has been having dreams about Ashe and Danny. One night when a crow leads her to the scene of the murders of Ashe and Danny, Ashe appears before her. The crow has resurrected Ashe, so Ashe can go after Judah and his right hand man Curve. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing off Judah's men one by one, on his way to Judah. Yes, many think that this film is sacrilege and trounces on Lees grave, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel, very dark, and seems very visceral at times. I love the first movie, it has that tone to it and obviously what happened to Lee makes the film more poignant and essential. It was inevitable that there was going to be a sequel as the film shouts our franchise, whether you like it or not. Perez is obviously no Lee, but he wasn't supposed to be, he is his own 'Crow' ans this film has more of a paternal feel to it, rather than the dark romanticism of the first. And this is where the film usurps the first, the villains in this are more entertaining, even if they are over the top and more theatrical. Judah though, isn't a patch on Top Dollar, but has some good scenes and hilarious dialogue. So all in all it's a sequel, but a heavily underrated one, thanks to obsessed fans of the first who dismissed this. The set pieces are great, the soundtrack as dark as the first, and a whole 'dusk' vibe throughout the whole movie. It's obviously directed by a music video director, as the editing is sharp and some of the cinematography is stark. It's okay to say that this movie is good, you won't offend anyone, or lose the mysticism of the original.

    I wish you could give negative ratings. This is awful, a film without redeeming features. Let's list them. Story - 100% copy Bad Guy - Pathetic Good Guy - An shambolic shadow of Eric Draven Aesthetics - not sure was too dark to see anything. The Crow is one of a few films I would give 10/10 to. As such it is obviously one of my all time favourites. This is my actual least fave film and it includes films I couldn't watch in their entirety such as the original Re-Hash of The Hulk or recently Barbarossa! There is no reason at all to watch this film. it's not camp and therefore funny. It is not ironic, self deprecating or even a decent stand alone flick. Its appalling. Watch something else

    To be honest, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. The visuals are amazing, and the city feels fleshed out. It really feels like you're in a drug infested Los Angeles in the middle of the 90's, something the first film achieved greatly. They didn't go cheesy with this movie as much as they did the titles that followed it (with Ed Furlong and the other guy), but people still see it as a remake. It's actually a sequel, with a more pure love in my opinion than the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, try to watch it with an open mind. Vincent Perez does a great job as the lead role, and completely steals the spotlight from everyone else in the film. It's worth watching for him alone.

    I gave this sequel seven stars because, despite the fact that this film has some problems, it's still a good popcorn pusher - and there are worse ways to waste over an hour of your precious mortal life span. It's not Oscar material - but it's OK. Some parts were even emotionally satisfying. I liked Vincent Perez in the title role. He brought an interesting level of maturity to the character, and the fact that he was not playing a natively born American Crow gave a new sense of cosmic universality to the concept of the possessing avenging spirit that is the Crow character essentially. Although I liked the plot twist that the Crow was avenging his child as opposed to a wife or lover because it gave the film somewhat of a different, more "across the board" emotional relatability, I still felt that about 70% of the film was a template derivative of the original, with far too many common elements to fully assert it's expectations to truly stand on it's own. Richard Brooks made an interesting arch nemesis, but the character of Judah Earl I found to be a little too self absorbed and narcissistic to really invest a great deal of focus on. Brooks's character was more interested in complete personal exaltation and fulfillment and less interested in a grander ethos, which made his motivations too one dimensional and clich&eacute; for me to be interested in. Brooks however did do well with the predictable character profile that he was provided by the writers - and I think that he pushed it as far as he could as a gifted actor. Mia Kirshner's character of Sarah, apparently the little girl from the original Crow film, was disappointing. The character of the child Sarah from the original Brandon Lee film was a tough kid that was practical, down to Earth, and that had a more pragmatic, everyday way of looking at things - while Mia Kirshner's Sarah was too vulnerable, creepy, and far too "witchy" to be believed as the adult extension of the original. Kirshner's character in this film would have been the last place that you would have expected the original character of Sarah to have ended up. It seemed to be a device created by the writers to over accentuate the occultism of the film - which was overkill and over saturating. My problem is not with Kirshner's performance, it was splendid - it was with the revised "update" of her character that deviated far too much from the personality of the original Sarah character that it undermined the character's continuity from the first film. All in all - not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better, had the film makers been more attentive to the defining elements of the original film, yet had taken the time to develop some of the characters better - and had deleted a few of the more derivative clich&eacute; character types and elements.

    I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them. First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying. The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected. I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them. What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.

    It takes off after about 20 minutes or so. Pretty much once we reach the hell ride there is a leap in quality that is of course overshadowed by the weaknesses of the scene which follows. I feel it's at about the point where he pulls out the deck of cards and the way he does it the film finally starts to fulfill expectations. Overall it's certainly worth watching but I do not challenge the dislike so many people have for it. When you watch it with an open mind, you can see about 20 minutes of footage needs to be cut, rewrote, reshot and maybe 5 or 10 minutes of footage added for story and character setup. I watch this movie once every couple years and each time I think omG this is BAD. Then as always, it gets better as the story continues not better each time you watch it. The fact is, they could have fixed everything wrong with it and it might have still been a box office disappointment. People wanted Brandon or at least an exact duplicate of the first in far too many respects for this B caliber sequel to get a chance. All that speculation cast aside, I still see the potential in this film that if explored properly, would have produced a sequel as amazing as the first. The soundtrack just wasn't there and the 20 minutes of turd needed to be cut, rewrote and reshot. It also doesn't help that the footage looks like it was shot on a high quality JVC commercial grade camcorder with the same texture as soap operas and low budget TV shows then some type of opaque effect added for a generic comic book feel. That says everything really. This was one of the first B-movies in many years to find it's way into the theater. That in itself is quite an achievement even though it's pretty common today. However, you'll find majority of the B-movies that followed it's coat tails into theaters were similar genre and visual style. It actually paved the door for a lot of the B-movies that squirmed their way into theaters from various genres, not just these dark fantasy action thrillers. For better or for worse, we now see a lot of B movies in theaters that are absolute garbage compared to this film.

    Everybody who saw "The Crow" (1994), a grisly but formulaic back-fr0m-the-dead revenge melodrama, knows actor Brandon Lee died from an accidental gunshot wound on the set during filming. Strangely enough, Lee's untimely demise boosted the box office appeal of "The Crow." The success prompted Miramax Pictures to release a sequel of sorts: "The Crow: City of Angels." Not only have the film producers replaced Lee with another actor, but they also have conjured up an entirely new character. Sequels typically fail to live up to the high standards of most original films, but "The Crow: City of Angels" proves the exception to the rule. The message of "The Crow: City of Angels," a nihilistic supernatural sadomasochistic saga, is that love is sometimes stronger than death. Nevertheless, love takes a backseat to violence in this expressionistic follow-up to the ill-fated but financially successful original. Instead, the filmmakers aim their cameras like guns at the more unsavory narrative elements: brutal murders and echoes of deviant sexual practices with an incidental node to the love aspect. The premise of the first "Crow" reechoes throughout the sequel. When somebody dies, a crow carries the soul to the land of the dead. Occasionally, something so horrible occurs that a soul can find no rest. In such a case, the crow leads the soul back to the living so that injustices can be resolved. David Goyer, who penned the original "Crow," tinkers rather than tampers with the surefire formula that yielded a $50 million haul at the box office. A cadaverous hero rises from the grave and destroys a depraved gang of low-life hemorrhoids. In "The Crow: City of Angels," a twenty-something auto mechanic, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez of "Queen Margot"), and his young son Danny (Eric Acosta of "Cheerleader Massacre 2") witness a gangland execution by a drug kingpin called Judah. The setting has been changed from the Motor City to the City of Angels. Instead of hoodlums celebrating Devil's Night, as in the original, here citizens participate in the Day of the Dead ceremonies designed to discourage departing spirits from lingering with the living. Eight years have elapsed since the first movie, and Sarah (Mia Kirshner of "Not Another Teen Movie") is the only hold-over character from the original. Sarah has grown up, moved to Los Angeles, and now runs a tattoo parlor. Sarah has been having nightmares lately, about a double homicide. A crow flies into her apartment, and she follows it to the harbor where the bodies of Ash and his son were dumped. The crow revives Ashe, and he emerges in a frothy fountain of bubbles before Sarah's eyes. When Ashe embarks on his revenge, Sarah paints his face in the same Harlequin pattern as Eric Draven's from the first film. Only this time, she uses Ashe's dead son's paints, giving it a truly symbolic meaning. Ashe begins knocking off Judah's (Richard Brooks) henchmen, working his way, as he calls it "up the food chain" to Judah himself. The villains comprise an undeniably loathsome bunch. You'd certainly never invite these scumbags home to meet your parents. Curve, (plug-ugly Iggy Pop of "Tank Girl") resembles death warmed over, while a dark smooth-skinned Richard Brooks as Judah presents a commanding presence. The drug dealing merchant of pain here is so repellent that he display little remorse when a poorly mixed batch of his own narcotics kills his customers. Every time one of these reptilian characters dies, the image of a crow appears around him. For example, when Ashe pitches one baddie from a window, the blood from the dead person's head coagulates in a puddle shaped like a crow. Compared with the first film, "City of Angels" isn't as violent. There is nothing here that comes off as violent as the table scene where Brandon Lee's Eric Draven got blasted by a barrage of gunfire. French heartthrob Vincent Perez animates his slain avenger with a Gallic exuberance. Perez's performance also conveys a quality that makes his character vulnerable and at the same time somewhat melancholy because he is deprived of life. Ashe reveals his reluctance to Sarah to blindly adhere to the fix path that fate has paved for him. Audiences learn the bare minimum about him. All we know about his wife is that she abounded him and their son after she became a drug addict. Unlike Eric Draven, Ashe's body doesn't erase the signs of violence. Gunshot wounds don't magically vanish. He spends more time tooling about on his motorcycle in search of felons and he never carries the crow around on his shoulder. Goyer's episodic script resembles a formula Republic serial from the 1940s. A mysterious hero enters a destitute city and topples a tyrant. Compared with the longer original film, "City of Angels" amounts to a severely pared down exercise in minimalism. The filmmakers have sacrificed exposition, which would clarify characters and story, for supercharged, headlong momentum. If you're looking for exposition, try the web site for "The Crow: City of Angels," because only the most essential information for pushing the plot forward remains in the film. Goyer and director Tim Pope keep the narrative simple, the characters shallow, and the story free from complications or digressive sub-plots. Extraneous characters, such as Ernie Hudson's cop from the first "Crow" don't clutter up the storyline. "The Crow: City of Angels" marks the motion picture debut of music-video director Tim Pope. Previously, Pope helmed music videos for Paul McCartney, Iggy Pop, Queen, and David Bowie. Pope clearly draws on his background so that his "Crow" boasts a fast-paced, no-nonsense, imagine intensive appearance. The film possesses a murky, Gothic look. Smoke swirls around the different bombed-out nocturnal settings, and Pope bathes different scenes in harsh, abrasive color schemes. The wide-angled point of view shots from the perspective of the craw have an avant-garde quality. You don't need to have seen "The Crow" to appreciate "The Crow: City of Angeles."

    The Crow: City of Angels (1996) * 1/2 (out of 4) A vicious drug dealer (Richard Brooks) has mechanic Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) killed along with his wife and young son. A year later the crow leads the mechanic back from the dead for revenge. Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination. The lack of imagination is something that can be said about the majority of this film as this sequel just never gets off the ground.

    Ah, 1996's "The Crow: City of Angels"- the first sequel in the downfall of a once-promising franchise. Directed by Tim Pope and written by David S. Goyer (whom both went on to disown the film due to studio re-edits that destroyed it), this is the tragic misstep that destroyed the series after the incredible 1994 debut. Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man whom was murdered, along with his child, after witnessing a gang-related hit. Some time later (it's never exactly established, but I think it's a short time later), Ashe is brought back by the power of a crow, to seek vengeance. He is helped along the way by Sarah... yes, the same Sarah from the first film, now all grown up and quite stunning (portrayed by the sexy Mia Kirshner). She uses Eric Draven's influence on her to paint the iconic crow makeup onto Ashe and send him on his way, also acting as a slight love interest in the rushed narrative. Ashe is after Judah (Richard Brooks), the drug lord of Los Angelas, who is sort of responsible for the loss of his own life and that of his child. Judah's men (including Thomas Jane, Iggy Pop and the late and great Thuy Trang) are the ones who murdered him. Through a bizarre series of events that just don't "gel" together properly, Judah forms a plan to steal the powers of the crow to make himself invincible, and Ashe must stop him at all costs. To give credit where it is due, there are some good aspects to the film. For starters, Pope's direction is quite nice, on the whole. He went for what seems to be the exact opposite of what Alex Proyas did with the first film. The movie is all in shades of red, orange, purple, etc. It's much harsher and more angry, and camera-work is generally good. Graeme Revell also returns to score the film, and he utilizes a fantastic combination of new themes with musical cues from the prior film. It helps ground them both in the same universe. And the performances aren't bad. However, it stops there. The films really, truly suffers from the studio re-edits. Rumor has it that the original cut of the film was much longer and significantly different, but Miramax, wanting to cash in on the success of the first film, had more than an hour of footage cut, and many scenes re-arranged in the narrative, in order to make it more like the original. And it shows. The pacing is sloppy and characters are left completely undeveloped. In addition, the tragedy and connection to the characters is also severed, and the ending (without spoiling anything) makes no sense whatsoever. The film feels like it's missing the backbone to the story, and what's left after these studio edits feels like an empty shell. It's barely watchable as-is, and isn't very enjoyable. Here's to hoping that one day, we may get the original cut of the film (which isn't the DVD Director's Cut, don't be fooled), and see this film in the best possible way, as the original cut does sound far superior. As it stands, "The Crow: City of Angels" gets a 3 out of 10. It's a worse version of the original film, and should be skipped over by all but die-hard fans who feel they need to see it.

    naturally this movie was not going to live up to the original which is a classic. But, it has its good points. the set up was done well with the murder of the man and son enhanced by good cinematography. I also think the landscape was done well creating a post apocalyptic feel. i think in my eyes the best scene was when the crow retrieves his son from the river and buries him which was enhanced by music from the original crow(best scene id say). the bad points for me was character based, the crow's dialogue and witty remarks i found were not effective. the villains (besides Iggy pop who i think did well) were portrayed weak and not in depth. Main bad point for me was a real weak ending where the crow summons crows to fly through him and destroy the immortal bad guy. thought that was i really poor written ending. I suppose as this was a sequel they couldn't make the concept as subtle as the first one without completely replicating it. still it was enjoyable to watch again after 14 years. probably wont be watching any time soon again tho. oh and at least it didn't have Tara Reid

    Some time ago, Ashe Corven and his son Danny were killed when they stumbled across a pack of drug dealers murdering a fellow dealer. The dealers work for Los Angeles drug kingpin Judah. Local tattoo artist Sarah, who has great knowledge of the crow legend because of what happened with her late friend, has been having dreams about Ashe and Danny. One night when a crow leads her to the scene of the murders of Ashe and Danny, Ashe appears before her. The crow has resurrected Ashe, so Ashe can go after Judah and his right hand man Curve. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing off Judah's men one by one, on his way to Judah. Yes, many think that this film is sacrilege and trounces on Lees grave, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel, very dark, and seems very visceral at times. I love the first movie, it has that tone to it and obviously what happened to Lee makes the film more poignant and essential. It was inevitable that there was going to be a sequel as the film shouts our franchise, whether you like it or not. Perez is obviously no Lee, but he wasn't supposed to be, he is his own 'Crow' ans this film has more of a paternal feel to it, rather than the dark romanticism of the first. And this is where the film usurps the first, the villains in this are more entertaining, even if they are over the top and more theatrical. Judah though, isn't a patch on Top Dollar, but has some good scenes and hilarious dialogue. So all in all it's a sequel, but a heavily underrated one, thanks to obsessed fans of the first who dismissed this. The set pieces are great, the soundtrack as dark as the first, and a whole 'dusk' vibe throughout the whole movie. It's obviously directed by a music video director, as the editing is sharp and some of the cinematography is stark. It's okay to say that this movie is good, you won't offend anyone, or lose the mysticism of the original.

    I wish you could give negative ratings. This is awful, a film without redeeming features. Let's list them. Story - 100% copy Bad Guy - Pathetic Good Guy - An shambolic shadow of Eric Draven Aesthetics - not sure was too dark to see anything. The Crow is one of a few films I would give 10/10 to. As such it is obviously one of my all time favourites. This is my actual least fave film and it includes films I couldn't watch in their entirety such as the original Re-Hash of The Hulk or recently Barbarossa! There is no reason at all to watch this film. it's not camp and therefore funny. It is not ironic, self deprecating or even a decent stand alone flick. Its appalling. Watch something else

    To be honest, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. The visuals are amazing, and the city feels fleshed out. It really feels like you're in a drug infested Los Angeles in the middle of the 90's, something the first film achieved greatly. They didn't go cheesy with this movie as much as they did the titles that followed it (with Ed Furlong and the other guy), but people still see it as a remake. It's actually a sequel, with a more pure love in my opinion than the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, try to watch it with an open mind. Vincent Perez does a great job as the lead role, and completely steals the spotlight from everyone else in the film. It's worth watching for him alone.

    I gave this sequel seven stars because, despite the fact that this film has some problems, it's still a good popcorn pusher - and there are worse ways to waste over an hour of your precious mortal life span. It's not Oscar material - but it's OK. Some parts were even emotionally satisfying. I liked Vincent Perez in the title role. He brought an interesting level of maturity to the character, and the fact that he was not playing a natively born American Crow gave a new sense of cosmic universality to the concept of the possessing avenging spirit that is the Crow character essentially. Although I liked the plot twist that the Crow was avenging his child as opposed to a wife or lover because it gave the film somewhat of a different, more "across the board" emotional relatability, I still felt that about 70% of the film was a template derivative of the original, with far too many common elements to fully assert it's expectations to truly stand on it's own. Richard Brooks made an interesting arch nemesis, but the character of Judah Earl I found to be a little too self absorbed and narcissistic to really invest a great deal of focus on. Brooks's character was more interested in complete personal exaltation and fulfillment and less interested in a grander ethos, which made his motivations too one dimensional and clich&eacute; for me to be interested in. Brooks however did do well with the predictable character profile that he was provided by the writers - and I think that he pushed it as far as he could as a gifted actor. Mia Kirshner's character of Sarah, apparently the little girl from the original Crow film, was disappointing. The character of the child Sarah from the original Brandon Lee film was a tough kid that was practical, down to Earth, and that had a more pragmatic, everyday way of looking at things - while Mia Kirshner's Sarah was too vulnerable, creepy, and far too "witchy" to be believed as the adult extension of the original. Kirshner's character in this film would have been the last place that you would have expected the original character of Sarah to have ended up. It seemed to be a device created by the writers to over accentuate the occultism of the film - which was overkill and over saturating. My problem is not with Kirshner's performance, it was splendid - it was with the revised "update" of her character that deviated far too much from the personality of the original Sarah character that it undermined the character's continuity from the first film. All in all - not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better, had the film makers been more attentive to the defining elements of the original film, yet had taken the time to develop some of the characters better - and had deleted a few of the more derivative clich&eacute; character types and elements.

    I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them. First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying. The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected. I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them. What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.

    It takes off after about 20 minutes or so. Pretty much once we reach the hell ride there is a leap in quality that is of course overshadowed by the weaknesses of the scene which follows. I feel it's at about the point where he pulls out the deck of cards and the way he does it the film finally starts to fulfill expectations. Overall it's certainly worth watching but I do not challenge the dislike so many people have for it. When you watch it with an open mind, you can see about 20 minutes of footage needs to be cut, rewrote, reshot and maybe 5 or 10 minutes of footage added for story and character setup. I watch this movie once every couple years and each time I think omG this is BAD. Then as always, it gets better as the story continues not better each time you watch it. The fact is, they could have fixed everything wrong with it and it might have still been a box office disappointment. People wanted Brandon or at least an exact duplicate of the first in far too many respects for this B caliber sequel to get a chance. All that speculation cast aside, I still see the potential in this film that if explored properly, would have produced a sequel as amazing as the first. The soundtrack just wasn't there and the 20 minutes of turd needed to be cut, rewrote and reshot. It also doesn't help that the footage looks like it was shot on a high quality JVC commercial grade camcorder with the same texture as soap operas and low budget TV shows then some type of opaque effect added for a generic comic book feel. That says everything really. This was one of the first B-movies in many years to find it's way into the theater. That in itself is quite an achievement even though it's pretty common today. However, you'll find majority of the B-movies that followed it's coat tails into theaters were similar genre and visual style. It actually paved the door for a lot of the B-movies that squirmed their way into theaters from various genres, not just these dark fantasy action thrillers. For better or for worse, we now see a lot of B movies in theaters that are absolute garbage compared to this film.

    Everybody who saw "The Crow" (1994), a grisly but formulaic back-fr0m-the-dead revenge melodrama, knows actor Brandon Lee died from an accidental gunshot wound on the set during filming. Strangely enough, Lee's untimely demise boosted the box office appeal of "The Crow." The success prompted Miramax Pictures to release a sequel of sorts: "The Crow: City of Angels." Not only have the film producers replaced Lee with another actor, but they also have conjured up an entirely new character. Sequels typically fail to live up to the high standards of most original films, but "The Crow: City of Angels" proves the exception to the rule. The message of "The Crow: City of Angels," a nihilistic supernatural sadomasochistic saga, is that love is sometimes stronger than death. Nevertheless, love takes a backseat to violence in this expressionistic follow-up to the ill-fated but financially successful original. Instead, the filmmakers aim their cameras like guns at the more unsavory narrative elements: brutal murders and echoes of deviant sexual practices with an incidental node to the love aspect. The premise of the first "Crow" reechoes throughout the sequel. When somebody dies, a crow carries the soul to the land of the dead. Occasionally, something so horrible occurs that a soul can find no rest. In such a case, the crow leads the soul back to the living so that injustices can be resolved. David Goyer, who penned the original "Crow," tinkers rather than tampers with the surefire formula that yielded a $50 million haul at the box office. A cadaverous hero rises from the grave and destroys a depraved gang of low-life hemorrhoids. In "The Crow: City of Angels," a twenty-something auto mechanic, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez of "Queen Margot"), and his young son Danny (Eric Acosta of "Cheerleader Massacre 2") witness a gangland execution by a drug kingpin called Judah. The setting has been changed from the Motor City to the City of Angels. Instead of hoodlums celebrating Devil's Night, as in the original, here citizens participate in the Day of the Dead ceremonies designed to discourage departing spirits from lingering with the living. Eight years have elapsed since the first movie, and Sarah (Mia Kirshner of "Not Another Teen Movie") is the only hold-over character from the original. Sarah has grown up, moved to Los Angeles, and now runs a tattoo parlor. Sarah has been having nightmares lately, about a double homicide. A crow flies into her apartment, and she follows it to the harbor where the bodies of Ash and his son were dumped. The crow revives Ashe, and he emerges in a frothy fountain of bubbles before Sarah's eyes. When Ashe embarks on his revenge, Sarah paints his face in the same Harlequin pattern as Eric Draven's from the first film. Only this time, she uses Ashe's dead son's paints, giving it a truly symbolic meaning. Ashe begins knocking off Judah's (Richard Brooks) henchmen, working his way, as he calls it "up the food chain" to Judah himself. The villains comprise an undeniably loathsome bunch. You'd certainly never invite these scumbags home to meet your parents. Curve, (plug-ugly Iggy Pop of "Tank Girl") resembles death warmed over, while a dark smooth-skinned Richard Brooks as Judah presents a commanding presence. The drug dealing merchant of pain here is so repellent that he display little remorse when a poorly mixed batch of his own narcotics kills his customers. Every time one of these reptilian characters dies, the image of a crow appears around him. For example, when Ashe pitches one baddie from a window, the blood from the dead person's head coagulates in a puddle shaped like a crow. Compared with the first film, "City of Angels" isn't as violent. There is nothing here that comes off as violent as the table scene where Brandon Lee's Eric Draven got blasted by a barrage of gunfire. French heartthrob Vincent Perez animates his slain avenger with a Gallic exuberance. Perez's performance also conveys a quality that makes his character vulnerable and at the same time somewhat melancholy because he is deprived of life. Ashe reveals his reluctance to Sarah to blindly adhere to the fix path that fate has paved for him. Audiences learn the bare minimum about him. All we know about his wife is that she abounded him and their son after she became a drug addict. Unlike Eric Draven, Ashe's body doesn't erase the signs of violence. Gunshot wounds don't magically vanish. He spends more time tooling about on his motorcycle in search of felons and he never carries the crow around on his shoulder. Goyer's episodic script resembles a formula Republic serial from the 1940s. A mysterious hero enters a destitute city and topples a tyrant. Compared with the longer original film, "City of Angels" amounts to a severely pared down exercise in minimalism. The filmmakers have sacrificed exposition, which would clarify characters and story, for supercharged, headlong momentum. If you're looking for exposition, try the web site for "The Crow: City of Angels," because only the most essential information for pushing the plot forward remains in the film. Goyer and director Tim Pope keep the narrative simple, the characters shallow, and the story free from complications or digressive sub-plots. Extraneous characters, such as Ernie Hudson's cop from the first "Crow" don't clutter up the storyline. "The Crow: City of Angels" marks the motion picture debut of music-video director Tim Pope. Previously, Pope helmed music videos for Paul McCartney, Iggy Pop, Queen, and David Bowie. Pope clearly draws on his background so that his "Crow" boasts a fast-paced, no-nonsense, imagine intensive appearance. The film possesses a murky, Gothic look. Smoke swirls around the different bombed-out nocturnal settings, and Pope bathes different scenes in harsh, abrasive color schemes. The wide-angled point of view shots from the perspective of the craw have an avant-garde quality. You don't need to have seen "The Crow" to appreciate "The Crow: City of Angeles."

    The Crow: City of Angels (1996) * 1/2 (out of 4) A vicious drug dealer (Richard Brooks) has mechanic Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) killed along with his wife and young son. A year later the crow leads the mechanic back from the dead for revenge. Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination. The lack of imagination is something that can be said about the majority of this film as this sequel just never gets off the ground.

    Ah, 1996's "The Crow: City of Angels"- the first sequel in the downfall of a once-promising franchise. Directed by Tim Pope and written by David S. Goyer (whom both went on to disown the film due to studio re-edits that destroyed it), this is the tragic misstep that destroyed the series after the incredible 1994 debut. Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man whom was murdered, along with his child, after witnessing a gang-related hit. Some time later (it's never exactly established, but I think it's a short time later), Ashe is brought back by the power of a crow, to seek vengeance. He is helped along the way by Sarah... yes, the same Sarah from the first film, now all grown up and quite stunning (portrayed by the sexy Mia Kirshner). She uses Eric Draven's influence on her to paint the iconic crow makeup onto Ashe and send him on his way, also acting as a slight love interest in the rushed narrative. Ashe is after Judah (Richard Brooks), the drug lord of Los Angelas, who is sort of responsible for the loss of his own life and that of his child. Judah's men (including Thomas Jane, Iggy Pop and the late and great Thuy Trang) are the ones who murdered him. Through a bizarre series of events that just don't "gel" together properly, Judah forms a plan to steal the powers of the crow to make himself invincible, and Ashe must stop him at all costs. To give credit where it is due, there are some good aspects to the film. For starters, Pope's direction is quite nice, on the whole. He went for what seems to be the exact opposite of what Alex Proyas did with the first film. The movie is all in shades of red, orange, purple, etc. It's much harsher and more angry, and camera-work is generally good. Graeme Revell also returns to score the film, and he utilizes a fantastic combination of new themes with musical cues from the prior film. It helps ground them both in the same universe. And the performances aren't bad. However, it stops there. The films really, truly suffers from the studio re-edits. Rumor has it that the original cut of the film was much longer and significantly different, but Miramax, wanting to cash in on the success of the first film, had more than an hour of footage cut, and many scenes re-arranged in the narrative, in order to make it more like the original. And it shows. The pacing is sloppy and characters are left completely undeveloped. In addition, the tragedy and connection to the characters is also severed, and the ending (without spoiling anything) makes no sense whatsoever. The film feels like it's missing the backbone to the story, and what's left after these studio edits feels like an empty shell. It's barely watchable as-is, and isn't very enjoyable. Here's to hoping that one day, we may get the original cut of the film (which isn't the DVD Director's Cut, don't be fooled), and see this film in the best possible way, as the original cut does sound far superior. As it stands, "The Crow: City of Angels" gets a 3 out of 10. It's a worse version of the original film, and should be skipped over by all but die-hard fans who feel they need to see it.

    Some time ago, Ashe Corven and his son Danny were killed when they stumbled across a pack of drug dealers murdering a fellow dealer. The dealers work for Los Angeles drug kingpin Judah. Local tattoo artist Sarah, who has great knowledge of the crow legend because of what happened with her late friend, has been having dreams about Ashe and Danny. One night when a crow leads her to the scene of the murders of Ashe and Danny, Ashe appears before her. The crow has resurrected Ashe, so Ashe can go after Judah and his right hand man Curve. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing off Judah's men one by one, on his way to Judah. Yes, many think that this film is sacrilege and trounces on Lees grave, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel, very dark, and seems very visceral at times. I love the first movie, it has that tone to it and obviously what happened to Lee makes the film more poignant and essential. It was inevitable that there was going to be a sequel as the film shouts our franchise, whether you like it or not. Perez is obviously no Lee, but he wasn't supposed to be, he is his own 'Crow' ans this film has more of a paternal feel to it, rather than the dark romanticism of the first. And this is where the film usurps the first, the villains in this are more entertaining, even if they are over the top and more theatrical. Judah though, isn't a patch on Top Dollar, but has some good scenes and hilarious dialogue. So all in all it's a sequel, but a heavily underrated one, thanks to obsessed fans of the first who dismissed this. The set pieces are great, the soundtrack as dark as the first, and a whole 'dusk' vibe throughout the whole movie. It's obviously directed by a music video director, as the editing is sharp and some of the cinematography is stark. It's okay to say that this movie is good, you won't offend anyone, or lose the mysticism of the original.

    I wish you could give negative ratings. This is awful, a film without redeeming features. Let's list them. Story - 100% copy Bad Guy - Pathetic Good Guy - An shambolic shadow of Eric Draven Aesthetics - not sure was too dark to see anything. The Crow is one of a few films I would give 10/10 to. As such it is obviously one of my all time favourites. This is my actual least fave film and it includes films I couldn't watch in their entirety such as the original Re-Hash of The Hulk or recently Barbarossa! There is no reason at all to watch this film. it's not camp and therefore funny. It is not ironic, self deprecating or even a decent stand alone flick. Its appalling. Watch something else

    To be honest, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. The visuals are amazing, and the city feels fleshed out. It really feels like you're in a drug infested Los Angeles in the middle of the 90's, something the first film achieved greatly. They didn't go cheesy with this movie as much as they did the titles that followed it (with Ed Furlong and the other guy), but people still see it as a remake. It's actually a sequel, with a more pure love in my opinion than the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, try to watch it with an open mind. Vincent Perez does a great job as the lead role, and completely steals the spotlight from everyone else in the film. It's worth watching for him alone.

    I gave this sequel seven stars because, despite the fact that this film has some problems, it's still a good popcorn pusher - and there are worse ways to waste over an hour of your precious mortal life span. It's not Oscar material - but it's OK. Some parts were even emotionally satisfying. I liked Vincent Perez in the title role. He brought an interesting level of maturity to the character, and the fact that he was not playing a natively born American Crow gave a new sense of cosmic universality to the concept of the possessing avenging spirit that is the Crow character essentially. Although I liked the plot twist that the Crow was avenging his child as opposed to a wife or lover because it gave the film somewhat of a different, more "across the board" emotional relatability, I still felt that about 70% of the film was a template derivative of the original, with far too many common elements to fully assert it's expectations to truly stand on it's own. Richard Brooks made an interesting arch nemesis, but the character of Judah Earl I found to be a little too self absorbed and narcissistic to really invest a great deal of focus on. Brooks's character was more interested in complete personal exaltation and fulfillment and less interested in a grander ethos, which made his motivations too one dimensional and clich&eacute; for me to be interested in. Brooks however did do well with the predictable character profile that he was provided by the writers - and I think that he pushed it as far as he could as a gifted actor. Mia Kirshner's character of Sarah, apparently the little girl from the original Crow film, was disappointing. The character of the child Sarah from the original Brandon Lee film was a tough kid that was practical, down to Earth, and that had a more pragmatic, everyday way of looking at things - while Mia Kirshner's Sarah was too vulnerable, creepy, and far too "witchy" to be believed as the adult extension of the original. Kirshner's character in this film would have been the last place that you would have expected the original character of Sarah to have ended up. It seemed to be a device created by the writers to over accentuate the occultism of the film - which was overkill and over saturating. My problem is not with Kirshner's performance, it was splendid - it was with the revised "update" of her character that deviated far too much from the personality of the original Sarah character that it undermined the character's continuity from the first film. All in all - not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better, had the film makers been more attentive to the defining elements of the original film, yet had taken the time to develop some of the characters better - and had deleted a few of the more derivative clich&eacute; character types and elements.

    I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them. First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying. The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected. I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them. What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.

    It takes off after about 20 minutes or so. Pretty much once we reach the hell ride there is a leap in quality that is of course overshadowed by the weaknesses of the scene which follows. I feel it's at about the point where he pulls out the deck of cards and the way he does it the film finally starts to fulfill expectations. Overall it's certainly worth watching but I do not challenge the dislike so many people have for it. When you watch it with an open mind, you can see about 20 minutes of footage needs to be cut, rewrote, reshot and maybe 5 or 10 minutes of footage added for story and character setup. I watch this movie once every couple years and each time I think omG this is BAD. Then as always, it gets better as the story continues not better each time you watch it. The fact is, they could have fixed everything wrong with it and it might have still been a box office disappointment. People wanted Brandon or at least an exact duplicate of the first in far too many respects for this B caliber sequel to get a chance. All that speculation cast aside, I still see the potential in this film that if explored properly, would have produced a sequel as amazing as the first. The soundtrack just wasn't there and the 20 minutes of turd needed to be cut, rewrote and reshot. It also doesn't help that the footage looks like it was shot on a high quality JVC commercial grade camcorder with the same texture as soap operas and low budget TV shows then some type of opaque effect added for a generic comic book feel. That says everything really. This was one of the first B-movies in many years to find it's way into the theater. That in itself is quite an achievement even though it's pretty common today. However, you'll find majority of the B-movies that followed it's coat tails into theaters were similar genre and visual style. It actually paved the door for a lot of the B-movies that squirmed their way into theaters from various genres, not just these dark fantasy action thrillers. For better or for worse, we now see a lot of B movies in theaters that are absolute garbage compared to this film.

    Everybody who saw "The Crow" (1994), a grisly but formulaic back-fr0m-the-dead revenge melodrama, knows actor Brandon Lee died from an accidental gunshot wound on the set during filming. Strangely enough, Lee's untimely demise boosted the box office appeal of "The Crow." The success prompted Miramax Pictures to release a sequel of sorts: "The Crow: City of Angels." Not only have the film producers replaced Lee with another actor, but they also have conjured up an entirely new character. Sequels typically fail to live up to the high standards of most original films, but "The Crow: City of Angels" proves the exception to the rule. The message of "The Crow: City of Angels," a nihilistic supernatural sadomasochistic saga, is that love is sometimes stronger than death. Nevertheless, love takes a backseat to violence in this expressionistic follow-up to the ill-fated but financially successful original. Instead, the filmmakers aim their cameras like guns at the more unsavory narrative elements: brutal murders and echoes of deviant sexual practices with an incidental node to the love aspect. The premise of the first "Crow" reechoes throughout the sequel. When somebody dies, a crow carries the soul to the land of the dead. Occasionally, something so horrible occurs that a soul can find no rest. In such a case, the crow leads the soul back to the living so that injustices can be resolved. David Goyer, who penned the original "Crow," tinkers rather than tampers with the surefire formula that yielded a $50 million haul at the box office. A cadaverous hero rises from the grave and destroys a depraved gang of low-life hemorrhoids. In "The Crow: City of Angels," a twenty-something auto mechanic, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez of "Queen Margot"), and his young son Danny (Eric Acosta of "Cheerleader Massacre 2") witness a gangland execution by a drug kingpin called Judah. The setting has been changed from the Motor City to the City of Angels. Instead of hoodlums celebrating Devil's Night, as in the original, here citizens participate in the Day of the Dead ceremonies designed to discourage departing spirits from lingering with the living. Eight years have elapsed since the first movie, and Sarah (Mia Kirshner of "Not Another Teen Movie") is the only hold-over character from the original. Sarah has grown up, moved to Los Angeles, and now runs a tattoo parlor. Sarah has been having nightmares lately, about a double homicide. A crow flies into her apartment, and she follows it to the harbor where the bodies of Ash and his son were dumped. The crow revives Ashe, and he emerges in a frothy fountain of bubbles before Sarah's eyes. When Ashe embarks on his revenge, Sarah paints his face in the same Harlequin pattern as Eric Draven's from the first film. Only this time, she uses Ashe's dead son's paints, giving it a truly symbolic meaning. Ashe begins knocking off Judah's (Richard Brooks) henchmen, working his way, as he calls it "up the food chain" to Judah himself. The villains comprise an undeniably loathsome bunch. You'd certainly never invite these scumbags home to meet your parents. Curve, (plug-ugly Iggy Pop of "Tank Girl") resembles death warmed over, while a dark smooth-skinned Richard Brooks as Judah presents a commanding presence. The drug dealing merchant of pain here is so repellent that he display little remorse when a poorly mixed batch of his own narcotics kills his customers. Every time one of these reptilian characters dies, the image of a crow appears around him. For example, when Ashe pitches one baddie from a window, the blood from the dead person's head coagulates in a puddle shaped like a crow. Compared with the first film, "City of Angels" isn't as violent. There is nothing here that comes off as violent as the table scene where Brandon Lee's Eric Draven got blasted by a barrage of gunfire. French heartthrob Vincent Perez animates his slain avenger with a Gallic exuberance. Perez's performance also conveys a quality that makes his character vulnerable and at the same time somewhat melancholy because he is deprived of life. Ashe reveals his reluctance to Sarah to blindly adhere to the fix path that fate has paved for him. Audiences learn the bare minimum about him. All we know about his wife is that she abounded him and their son after she became a drug addict. Unlike Eric Draven, Ashe's body doesn't erase the signs of violence. Gunshot wounds don't magically vanish. He spends more time tooling about on his motorcycle in search of felons and he never carries the crow around on his shoulder. Goyer's episodic script resembles a formula Republic serial from the 1940s. A mysterious hero enters a destitute city and topples a tyrant. Compared with the longer original film, "City of Angels" amounts to a severely pared down exercise in minimalism. The filmmakers have sacrificed exposition, which would clarify characters and story, for supercharged, headlong momentum. If you're looking for exposition, try the web site for "The Crow: City of Angels," because only the most essential information for pushing the plot forward remains in the film. Goyer and director Tim Pope keep the narrative simple, the characters shallow, and the story free from complications or digressive sub-plots. Extraneous characters, such as Ernie Hudson's cop from the first "Crow" don't clutter up the storyline. "The Crow: City of Angels" marks the motion picture debut of music-video director Tim Pope. Previously, Pope helmed music videos for Paul McCartney, Iggy Pop, Queen, and David Bowie. Pope clearly draws on his background so that his "Crow" boasts a fast-paced, no-nonsense, imagine intensive appearance. The film possesses a murky, Gothic look. Smoke swirls around the different bombed-out nocturnal settings, and Pope bathes different scenes in harsh, abrasive color schemes. The wide-angled point of view shots from the perspective of the craw have an avant-garde quality. You don't need to have seen "The Crow" to appreciate "The Crow: City of Angeles."

    The Crow: City of Angels (1996) * 1/2 (out of 4) A vicious drug dealer (Richard Brooks) has mechanic Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) killed along with his wife and young son. A year later the crow leads the mechanic back from the dead for revenge. Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination. The lack of imagination is something that can be said about the majority of this film as this sequel just never gets off the ground.

    Ah, 1996's "The Crow: City of Angels"- the first sequel in the downfall of a once-promising franchise. Directed by Tim Pope and written by David S. Goyer (whom both went on to disown the film due to studio re-edits that destroyed it), this is the tragic misstep that destroyed the series after the incredible 1994 debut. Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man whom was murdered, along with his child, after witnessing a gang-related hit. Some time later (it's never exactly established, but I think it's a short time later), Ashe is brought back by the power of a crow, to seek vengeance. He is helped along the way by Sarah... yes, the same Sarah from the first film, now all grown up and quite stunning (portrayed by the sexy Mia Kirshner). She uses Eric Draven's influence on her to paint the iconic crow makeup onto Ashe and send him on his way, also acting as a slight love interest in the rushed narrative. Ashe is after Judah (Richard Brooks), the drug lord of Los Angelas, who is sort of responsible for the loss of his own life and that of his child. Judah's men (including Thomas Jane, Iggy Pop and the late and great Thuy Trang) are the ones who murdered him. Through a bizarre series of events that just don't "gel" together properly, Judah forms a plan to steal the powers of the crow to make himself invincible, and Ashe must stop him at all costs. To give credit where it is due, there are some good aspects to the film. For starters, Pope's direction is quite nice, on the whole. He went for what seems to be the exact opposite of what Alex Proyas did with the first film. The movie is all in shades of red, orange, purple, etc. It's much harsher and more angry, and camera-work is generally good. Graeme Revell also returns to score the film, and he utilizes a fantastic combination of new themes with musical cues from the prior film. It helps ground them both in the same universe. And the performances aren't bad. However, it stops there. The films really, truly suffers from the studio re-edits. Rumor has it that the original cut of the film was much longer and significantly different, but Miramax, wanting to cash in on the success of the first film, had more than an hour of footage cut, and many scenes re-arranged in the narrative, in order to make it more like the original. And it shows. The pacing is sloppy and characters are left completely undeveloped. In addition, the tragedy and connection to the characters is also severed, and the ending (without spoiling anything) makes no sense whatsoever. The film feels like it's missing the backbone to the story, and what's left after these studio edits feels like an empty shell. It's barely watchable as-is, and isn't very enjoyable. Here's to hoping that one day, we may get the original cut of the film (which isn't the DVD Director's Cut, don't be fooled), and see this film in the best possible way, as the original cut does sound far superior. As it stands, "The Crow: City of Angels" gets a 3 out of 10. It's a worse version of the original film, and should be skipped over by all but die-hard fans who feel they need to see it.

    naturally this movie was not going to live up to the original which is a classic. But, it has its good points. the set up was done well with the murder of the man and son enhanced by good cinematography. I also think the landscape was done well creating a post apocalyptic feel. i think in my eyes the best scene was when the crow retrieves his son from the river and buries him which was enhanced by music from the original crow(best scene id say). the bad points for me was character based, the crow's dialogue and witty remarks i found were not effective. the villains (besides Iggy pop who i think did well) were portrayed weak and not in depth. Main bad point for me was a real weak ending where the crow summons crows to fly through him and destroy the immortal bad guy. thought that was i really poor written ending. I suppose as this was a sequel they couldn't make the concept as subtle as the first one without completely replicating it. still it was enjoyable to watch again after 14 years. probably wont be watching any time soon again tho. oh and at least it didn't have Tara Reid

    Some time ago, Ashe Corven and his son Danny were killed when they stumbled across a pack of drug dealers murdering a fellow dealer. The dealers work for Los Angeles drug kingpin Judah. Local tattoo artist Sarah, who has great knowledge of the crow legend because of what happened with her late friend, has been having dreams about Ashe and Danny. One night when a crow leads her to the scene of the murders of Ashe and Danny, Ashe appears before her. The crow has resurrected Ashe, so Ashe can go after Judah and his right hand man Curve. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing off Judah's men one by one, on his way to Judah. Yes, many think that this film is sacrilege and trounces on Lees grave, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel, very dark, and seems very visceral at times. I love the first movie, it has that tone to it and obviously what happened to Lee makes the film more poignant and essential. It was inevitable that there was going to be a sequel as the film shouts our franchise, whether you like it or not. Perez is obviously no Lee, but he wasn't supposed to be, he is his own 'Crow' ans this film has more of a paternal feel to it, rather than the dark romanticism of the first. And this is where the film usurps the first, the villains in this are more entertaining, even if they are over the top and more theatrical. Judah though, isn't a patch on Top Dollar, but has some good scenes and hilarious dialogue. So all in all it's a sequel, but a heavily underrated one, thanks to obsessed fans of the first who dismissed this. The set pieces are great, the soundtrack as dark as the first, and a whole 'dusk' vibe throughout the whole movie. It's obviously directed by a music video director, as the editing is sharp and some of the cinematography is stark. It's okay to say that this movie is good, you won't offend anyone, or lose the mysticism of the original.

    To be honest, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. The visuals are amazing, and the city feels fleshed out. It really feels like you're in a drug infested Los Angeles in the middle of the 90's, something the first film achieved greatly. They didn't go cheesy with this movie as much as they did the titles that followed it (with Ed Furlong and the other guy), but people still see it as a remake. It's actually a sequel, with a more pure love in my opinion than the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, try to watch it with an open mind.

    I gave this sequel seven stars because, despite the fact that this film has some problems, it's still a good popcorn pusher - and there are worse ways to waste over an hour of your precious mortal life span. It's not Oscar material - but it's OK. Some parts were even emotionally satisfying. I liked Vincent Perez in the title role. He brought an interesting level of maturity to the character, and the fact that he was not playing a natively born American Crow gave a new sense of cosmic universality to the concept of the possessing avenging spirit that is the Crow character essentially. Although I liked the plot twist that the Crow was avenging his child as opposed to a wife or lover because it gave the film somewhat of a different, more "across the board" emotional relatability, I still felt that about 70% of the film was a template derivative of the original, with far too many common elements to fully assert it's expectations to truly stand on it's own. Richard Brooks made an interesting arch nemesis, but the character of Judah Earl I found to be a little too self absorbed and narcissistic to really invest a great deal of focus on. Brooks's character was more interested in complete personal exaltation and fulfillment and less interested in a grander ethos, which made his motivations too one dimensional and clich&eacute; for me to be interested in. Brooks however did do well with the predictable character profile that he was provided by the writers - and I think that he pushed it as far as he could as a gifted actor. Mia Kirshner's character of Sarah, apparently the little girl from the original Crow film, was disappointing. The character of the child Sarah from the original Brandon Lee film was a tough kid that was practical, down to Earth, and that had a more pragmatic, everyday way of looking at things - while Mia Kirshner's Sarah was too vulnerable, creepy, and far too "witchy" to be believed as the adult extension of the original. Kirshner's character in this film would have been the last place that you would have expected the original character of Sarah to have ended up. It seemed to be a device created by the writers to over accentuate the occultism of the film - which was overkill and over saturating. My problem is not with Kirshner's performance, it was splendid - it was with the revised "update" of her character that deviated far too much from the personality of the original Sarah character that it undermined the character's continuity from the first film. All in all - not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better, had the film makers been more attentive to the defining elements of the original film, yet had taken the time to develop some of the characters better - and had deleted a few of the more derivative clich&eacute; character types and elements.

    I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them. First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying. The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected. I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them. What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.

    It takes off after about 20 minutes or so. Pretty much once we reach the hell ride there is a leap in quality that is of course overshadowed by the weaknesses of the scene which follows. I feel it's at about the point where he pulls out the deck of cards and the way he does it the film finally starts to fulfill expectations. Overall it's certainly worth watching but I do not challenge the dislike so many people have for it. When you watch it with an open mind, you can see about 20 minutes of footage needs to be cut, rewrote, reshot and maybe 5 or 10 minutes of footage added for story and character setup. I watch this movie once every couple years and each time I think omG this is BAD. Then as always, it gets better as the story continues not better each time you watch it. The fact is, they could have fixed everything wrong with it and it might have still been a box office disappointment. People wanted Brandon or at least an exact duplicate of the first in far too many respects for this B caliber sequel to get a chance. All that speculation cast aside, I still see the potential in this film that if explored properly, would have produced a sequel as amazing as the first. The soundtrack just wasn't there and the 20 minutes of turd needed to be cut, rewrote and reshot. It also doesn't help that the footage looks like it was shot on a high quality JVC commercial grade camcorder with the same texture as soap operas and low budget TV shows then some type of opaque effect added for a generic comic book feel. That says everything really. This was one of the first B-movies in many years to find it's way into the theater. That in itself is quite an achievement even though it's pretty common today. However, you'll find majority of the B-movies that followed it's coat tails into theaters were similar genre and visual style. It actually paved the door for a lot of the B-movies that squirmed their way into theaters from various genres, not just these dark fantasy action thrillers. For better or for worse, we now see a lot of B movies in theaters that are absolute garbage compared to this film.

    Everybody who saw "The Crow" (1994), a grisly but formulaic back-fr0m-the-dead revenge melodrama, knows actor Brandon Lee died from an accidental gunshot wound on the set during filming. Strangely enough, Lee's untimely demise boosted the box office appeal of "The Crow." The success prompted Miramax Pictures to release a sequel of sorts: "The Crow: City of Angels." Not only have the film producers replaced Lee with another actor, but they also have conjured up an entirely new character. Sequels typically fail to live up to the high standards of most original films, but "The Crow: City of Angels" proves the exception to the rule. The message of "The Crow: City of Angels," a nihilistic supernatural sadomasochistic saga, is that love is sometimes stronger than death. Nevertheless, love takes a backseat to violence in this expressionistic follow-up to the ill-fated but financially successful original. Instead, the filmmakers aim their cameras like guns at the more unsavory narrative elements: brutal murders and echoes of deviant sexual practices with an incidental node to the love aspect. The premise of the first "Crow" reechoes throughout the sequel. When somebody dies, a crow carries the soul to the land of the dead. Occasionally, something so horrible occurs that a soul can find no rest. In such a case, the crow leads the soul back to the living so that injustices can be resolved. David Goyer, who penned the original "Crow," tinkers rather than tampers with the surefire formula that yielded a $50 million haul at the box office. A cadaverous hero rises from the grave and destroys a depraved gang of low-life hemorrhoids. In "The Crow: City of Angels," a twenty-something auto mechanic, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez of "Queen Margot"), and his young son Danny (Eric Acosta of "Cheerleader Massacre 2") witness a gangland execution by a drug kingpin called Judah. The setting has been changed from the Motor City to the City of Angels. Instead of hoodlums celebrating Devil's Night, as in the original, here citizens participate in the Day of the Dead ceremonies designed to discourage departing spirits from lingering with the living. Eight years have elapsed since the first movie, and Sarah (Mia Kirshner of "Not Another Teen Movie") is the only hold-over character from the original. Sarah has grown up, moved to Los Angeles, and now runs a tattoo parlor. Sarah has been having nightmares lately, about a double homicide. A crow flies into her apartment, and she follows it to the harbor where the bodies of Ash and his son were dumped. The crow revives Ashe, and he emerges in a frothy fountain of bubbles before Sarah's eyes. When Ashe embarks on his revenge, Sarah paints his face in the same Harlequin pattern as Eric Draven's from the first film. Only this time, she uses Ashe's dead son's paints, giving it a truly symbolic meaning. Ashe begins knocking off Judah's (Richard Brooks) henchmen, working his way, as he calls it "up the food chain" to Judah himself. The villains comprise an undeniably loathsome bunch. You'd certainly never invite these scumbags home to meet your parents. Curve, (plug-ugly Iggy Pop of "Tank Girl") resembles death warmed over, while a dark smooth-skinned Richard Brooks as Judah presents a commanding presence. The drug dealing merchant of pain here is so repellent that he display little remorse when a poorly mixed batch of his own narcotics kills his customers. Every time one of these reptilian characters dies, the image of a crow appears around him. For example, when Ashe pitches one baddie from a window, the blood from the dead person's head coagulates in a puddle shaped like a crow. Compared with the first film, "City of Angels" isn't as violent. There is nothing here that comes off as violent as the table scene where Brandon Lee's Eric Draven got blasted by a barrage of gunfire. French heartthrob Vincent Perez animates his slain avenger with a Gallic exuberance. Perez's performance also conveys a quality that makes his character vulnerable and at the same time somewhat melancholy because he is deprived of life. Ashe reveals his reluctance to Sarah to blindly adhere to the fix path that fate has paved for him. Audiences learn the bare minimum about him. All we know about his wife is that she abounded him and their son after she became a drug addict. Unlike Eric Draven, Ashe's body doesn't erase the signs of violence. Gunshot wounds don't magically vanish. He spends more time tooling about on his motorcycle in search of felons and he never carries the crow around on his shoulder. Goyer's episodic script resembles a formula Republic serial from the 1940s. A mysterious hero enters a destitute city and topples a tyrant. Compared with the longer original film, "City of Angels" amounts to a severely pared down exercise in minimalism. The filmmakers have sacrificed exposition, which would clarify characters and story, for supercharged, headlong momentum. If you're looking for exposition, try the web site for "The Crow: City of Angels," because only the most essential information for pushing the plot forward remains in the film. Goyer and director Tim Pope keep the narrative simple, the characters shallow, and the story free from complications or digressive sub-plots. Extraneous characters, such as Ernie Hudson's cop from the first "Crow" don't clutter up the storyline. "The Crow: City of Angels" marks the motion picture debut of music-video director Tim Pope. Previously, Pope helmed music videos for Paul McCartney, Iggy Pop, Queen, and David Bowie. Pope clearly draws on his background so that his "Crow" boasts a fast-paced, no-nonsense, imagine intensive appearance. The film possesses a murky, Gothic look. Smoke swirls around the different bombed-out nocturnal settings, and Pope bathes different scenes in harsh, abrasive color schemes. The wide-angled point of view shots from the perspective of the craw have an avant-garde quality. You don't need to have seen "The Crow" to appreciate "The Crow: City of Angeles."

    The Crow: City of Angels (1996) * 1/2 (out of 4) A vicious drug dealer (Richard Brooks) has mechanic Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) killed along with his wife and young son. A year later the crow leads the mechanic back from the dead for revenge. Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination. The lack of imagination is something that can be said about the majority of this film as this sequel just never gets off the ground.

    Ah, 1996's "The Crow: City of Angels"- the first sequel in the downfall of a once-promising franchise. Directed by Tim Pope and written by David S. Goyer (whom both went on to disown the film due to studio re-edits that destroyed it), this is the tragic misstep that destroyed the series after the incredible 1994 debut. Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man whom was murdered, along with his child, after witnessing a gang-related hit. Some time later (it's never exactly established, but I think it's a short time later), Ashe is brought back by the power of a crow, to seek vengeance. He is helped along the way by Sarah... yes, the same Sarah from the first film, now all grown up and quite stunning (portrayed by the sexy Mia Kirshner). She uses Eric Draven's influence on her to paint the iconic crow makeup onto Ashe and send him on his way, also acting as a slight love interest in the rushed narrative. Ashe is after Judah (Richard Brooks), the drug lord of Los Angelas, who is sort of responsible for the loss of his own life and that of his child. Judah's men (including Thomas Jane, Iggy Pop and the late and great Thuy Trang) are the ones who murdered him. Through a bizarre series of events that just don't "gel" together properly, Judah forms a plan to steal the powers of the crow to make himself invincible, and Ashe must stop him at all costs. To give credit where it is due, there are some good aspects to the film. For starters, Pope's direction is quite nice, on the whole. He went for what seems to be the exact opposite of what Alex Proyas did with the first film. The movie is all in shades of red, orange, purple, etc. It's much harsher and more angry, and camera-work is generally good. Graeme Revell also returns to score the film, and he utilizes a fantastic combination of new themes with musical cues from the prior film. It helps ground them both in the same universe. And the performances aren't bad. However, it stops there. The films really, truly suffers from the studio re-edits. Rumor has it that the original cut of the film was much longer and significantly different, but Miramax, wanting to cash in on the success of the first film, had more than an hour of footage cut, and many scenes re-arranged in the narrative, in order to make it more like the original. And it shows. The pacing is sloppy and characters are left completely undeveloped. In addition, the tragedy and connection to the characters is also severed, and the ending (without spoiling anything) makes no sense whatsoever. The film feels like it's missing the backbone to the story, and what's left after these studio edits feels like an empty shell. It's barely watchable as-is, and isn't very enjoyable. Here's to hoping that one day, we may get the original cut of the film (which isn't the DVD Director's Cut, don't be fooled), and see this film in the best possible way, as the original cut does sound far superior. As it stands, "The Crow: City of Angels" gets a 3 out of 10. It's a worse version of the original film, and should be skipped over by all but die-hard fans who feel they need to see it.

    naturally this movie was not going to live up to the original which is a classic. But, it has its good points. the set up was done well with the murder of the man and son enhanced by good cinematography. I also think the landscape was done well creating a post apocalyptic feel. i think in my eyes the best scene was when the crow retrieves his son from the river and buries him which was enhanced by music from the original crow(best scene id say). the bad points for me was character based, the crow's dialogue and witty remarks i found were not effective. the villains (besides Iggy pop who i think did well) were portrayed weak and not in depth. Main bad point for me was a real weak ending where the crow summons crows to fly through him and destroy the immortal bad guy. thought that was i really poor written ending. I suppose as this was a sequel they couldn't make the concept as subtle as the first one without completely replicating it. still it was enjoyable to watch again after 14 years. probably wont be watching any time soon again tho. oh and at least it didn't have Tara Reid

    Some time ago, Ashe Corven and his son Danny were killed when they stumbled across a pack of drug dealers murdering a fellow dealer. The dealers work for Los Angeles drug kingpin Judah. Local tattoo artist Sarah, who has great knowledge of the crow legend because of what happened with her late friend, has been having dreams about Ashe and Danny. One night when a crow leads her to the scene of the murders of Ashe and Danny, Ashe appears before her. The crow has resurrected Ashe, so Ashe can go after Judah and his right hand man Curve. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing off Judah's men one by one, on his way to Judah. Yes, many think that this film is sacrilege and trounces on Lees grave, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel, very dark, and seems very visceral at times. I love the first movie, it has that tone to it and obviously what happened to Lee makes the film more poignant and essential. It was inevitable that there was going to be a sequel as the film shouts our franchise, whether you like it or not. Perez is obviously no Lee, but he wasn't supposed to be, he is his own 'Crow' ans this film has more of a paternal feel to it, rather than the dark romanticism of the first. And this is where the film usurps the first, the villains in this are more entertaining, even if they are over the top and more theatrical. Judah though, isn't a patch on Top Dollar, but has some good scenes and hilarious dialogue. So all in all it's a sequel, but a heavily underrated one, thanks to obsessed fans of the first who dismissed this. The set pieces are great, the soundtrack as dark as the first, and a whole 'dusk' vibe throughout the whole movie. It's obviously directed by a music video director, as the editing is sharp and some of the cinematography is stark. It's okay to say that this movie is good, you won't offend anyone, or lose the mysticism of the original.

    I wish you could give negative ratings. This is awful, a film without redeeming features. Let's list them. Story - 100% copy Bad Guy - Pathetic Good Guy - An shambolic shadow of Eric Draven Aesthetics - not sure was too dark to see anything. The Crow is one of a few films I would give 10/10 to. As such it is obviously one of my all time favourites. This is my actual least fave film and it includes films I couldn't watch in their entirety such as the original Re-Hash of The Hulk or recently Barbarossa! There is no reason at all to watch this film. it's not camp and therefore funny. It is not ironic, self deprecating or even a decent stand alone flick. Its appalling. Watch something else

    To be honest, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. The visuals are amazing, and the city feels fleshed out. It really feels like you're in a drug infested Los Angeles in the middle of the 90's, something the first film achieved greatly. They didn't go cheesy with this movie as much as they did the titles that followed it (with Ed Furlong and the other guy), but people still see it as a remake. It's actually a sequel, with a more pure love in my opinion than the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, try to watch it with an open mind. Vincent Perez does a great job as the lead role, and completely steals the spotlight from everyone else in the film. It's worth watching for him alone.

    I gave this sequel seven stars because, despite the fact that this film has some problems, it's still a good popcorn pusher - and there are worse ways to waste over an hour of your precious mortal life span. It's not Oscar material - but it's OK. Some parts were even emotionally satisfying. I liked Vincent Perez in the title role. He brought an interesting level of maturity to the character, and the fact that he was not playing a natively born American Crow gave a new sense of cosmic universality to the concept of the possessing avenging spirit that is the Crow character essentially. Although I liked the plot twist that the Crow was avenging his child as opposed to a wife or lover because it gave the film somewhat of a different, more "across the board" emotional relatability, I still felt that about 70% of the film was a template derivative of the original, with far too many common elements to fully assert it's expectations to truly stand on it's own. Richard Brooks made an interesting arch nemesis, but the character of Judah Earl I found to be a little too self absorbed and narcissistic to really invest a great deal of focus on. Brooks's character was more interested in complete personal exaltation and fulfillment and less interested in a grander ethos, which made his motivations too one dimensional and clich&eacute; for me to be interested in. Brooks however did do well with the predictable character profile that he was provided by the writers - and I think that he pushed it as far as he could as a gifted actor. Mia Kirshner's character of Sarah, apparently the little girl from the original Crow film, was disappointing. The character of the child Sarah from the original Brandon Lee film was a tough kid that was practical, down to Earth, and that had a more pragmatic, everyday way of looking at things - while Mia Kirshner's Sarah was too vulnerable, creepy, and far too "witchy" to be believed as the adult extension of the original. Kirshner's character in this film would have been the last place that you would have expected the original character of Sarah to have ended up. It seemed to be a device created by the writers to over accentuate the occultism of the film - which was overkill and over saturating. My problem is not with Kirshner's performance, it was splendid - it was with the revised "update" of her character that deviated far too much from the personality of the original Sarah character that it undermined the character's continuity from the first film. All in all - not a bad film, but it could have been a lot better, had the film makers been more attentive to the defining elements of the original film, yet had taken the time to develop some of the characters better - and had deleted a few of the more derivative clich&eacute; character types and elements.

    I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them. First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying. The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected. I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them. What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.

    It takes off after about 20 minutes or so. Pretty much once we reach the hell ride there is a leap in quality that is of course overshadowed by the weaknesses of the scene which follows. I feel it's at about the point where he pulls out the deck of cards and the way he does it the film finally starts to fulfill expectations. Overall it's certainly worth watching but I do not challenge the dislike so many people have for it. When you watch it with an open mind, you can see about 20 minutes of footage needs to be cut, rewrote, reshot and maybe 5 or 10 minutes of footage added for story and character setup. I watch this movie once every couple years and each time I think omG this is BAD. Then as always, it gets better as the story continues not better each time you watch it. The fact is, they could have fixed everything wrong with it and it might have still been a box office disappointment. People wanted Brandon or at least an exact duplicate of the first in far too many respects for this B caliber sequel to get a chance. All that speculation cast aside, I still see the potential in this film that if explored properly, would have produced a sequel as amazing as the first. The soundtrack just wasn't there and the 20 minutes of turd needed to be cut, rewrote and reshot. It also doesn't help that the footage looks like it was shot on a high quality JVC commercial grade camcorder with the same texture as soap operas and low budget TV shows then some type of opaque effect added for a generic comic book feel. That says everything really. This was one of the first B-movies in many years to find it's way into the theater. That in itself is quite an achievement even though it's pretty common today. However, you'll find majority of the B-movies that followed it's coat tails into theaters were similar genre and visual style. It actually paved the door for a lot of the B-movies that squirmed their way into theaters from various genres, not just these dark fantasy action thrillers. For better or for worse, we now see a lot of B movies in theaters that are absolute garbage compared to this film.

    Everybody who saw "The Crow" (1994), a grisly but formulaic back-fr0m-the-dead revenge melodrama, knows actor Brandon Lee died from an accidental gunshot wound on the set during filming. Strangely enough, Lee's untimely demise boosted the box office appeal of "The Crow." The success prompted Miramax Pictures to release a sequel of sorts: "The Crow: City of Angels." Not only have the film producers replaced Lee with another actor, but they also have conjured up an entirely new character. Sequels typically fail to live up to the high standards of most original films, but "The Crow: City of Angels" proves the exception to the rule. The message of "The Crow: City of Angels," a nihilistic supernatural sadomasochistic saga, is that love is sometimes stronger than death. Nevertheless, love takes a backseat to violence in this expressionistic follow-up to the ill-fated but financially successful original. Instead, the filmmakers aim their cameras like guns at the more unsavory narrative elements: brutal murders and echoes of deviant sexual practices with an incidental node to the love aspect. The premise of the first "Crow" reechoes throughout the sequel. When somebody dies, a crow carries the soul to the land of the dead. Occasionally, something so horrible occurs that a soul can find no rest. In such a case, the crow leads the soul back to the living so that injustices can be resolved. David Goyer, who penned the original "Crow," tinkers rather than tampers with the surefire formula that yielded a $50 million haul at the box office. A cadaverous hero rises from the grave and destroys a depraved gang of low-life hemorrhoids. In "The Crow: City of Angels," a twenty-something auto mechanic, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez of "Queen Margot"), and his young son Danny (Eric Acosta of "Cheerleader Massacre 2") witness a gangland execution by a drug kingpin called Judah. The setting has been changed from the Motor City to the City of Angels. Instead of hoodlums celebrating Devil's Night, as in the original, here citizens participate in the Day of the Dead ceremonies designed to discourage departing spirits from lingering with the living. Eight years have elapsed since the first movie, and Sarah (Mia Kirshner of "Not Another Teen Movie") is the only hold-over character from the original. Sarah has grown up, moved to Los Angeles, and now runs a tattoo parlor. Sarah has been having nightmares lately, about a double homicide. A crow flies into her apartment, and she follows it to the harbor where the bodies of Ash and his son were dumped. The crow revives Ashe, and he emerges in a frothy fountain of bubbles before Sarah's eyes. When Ashe embarks on his revenge, Sarah paints his face in the same Harlequin pattern as Eric Draven's from the first film. Only this time, she uses Ashe's dead son's paints, giving it a truly symbolic meaning. Ashe begins knocking off Judah's (Richard Brooks) henchmen, working his way, as he calls it "up the food chain" to Judah himself. The villains comprise an undeniably loathsome bunch. You'd certainly never invite these scumbags home to meet your parents. Curve, (plug-ugly Iggy Pop of "Tank Girl") resembles death warmed over, while a dark smooth-skinned Richard Brooks as Judah presents a commanding presence. The drug dealing merchant of pain here is so repellent that he display little remorse when a poorly mixed batch of his own narcotics kills his customers. Every time one of these reptilian characters dies, the image of a crow appears around him. For example, when Ashe pitches one baddie from a window, the blood from the dead person's head coagulates in a puddle shaped like a crow. Compared with the first film, "City of Angels" isn't as violent. There is nothing here that comes off as violent as the table scene where Brandon Lee's Eric Draven got blasted by a barrage of gunfire. French heartthrob Vincent Perez animates his slain avenger with a Gallic exuberance. Perez's performance also conveys a quality that makes his character vulnerable and at the same time somewhat melancholy because he is deprived of life. Ashe reveals his reluctance to Sarah to blindly adhere to the fix path that fate has paved for him. Audiences learn the bare minimum about him. All we know about his wife is that she abounded him and their son after she became a drug addict. Unlike Eric Draven, Ashe's body doesn't erase the signs of violence. Gunshot wounds don't magically vanish. He spends more time tooling about on his motorcycle in search of felons and he never carries the crow around on his shoulder. Goyer's episodic script resembles a formula Republic serial from the 1940s. A mysterious hero enters a destitute city and topples a tyrant. Compared with the longer original film, "City of Angels" amounts to a severely pared down exercise in minimalism. The filmmakers have sacrificed exposition, which would clarify characters and story, for supercharged, headlong momentum. If you're looking for exposition, try the web site for "The Crow: City of Angels," because only the most essential information for pushing the plot forward remains in the film. Goyer and director Tim Pope keep the narrative simple, the characters shallow, and the story free from complications or digressive sub-plots. Extraneous characters, such as Ernie Hudson's cop from the first "Crow" don't clutter up the storyline. "The Crow: City of Angels" marks the motion picture debut of music-video director Tim Pope. Previously, Pope helmed music videos for Paul McCartney, Iggy Pop, Queen, and David Bowie. Pope clearly draws on his background so that his "Crow" boasts a fast-paced, no-nonsense, imagine intensive appearance. The film possesses a murky, Gothic look. Smoke swirls around the different bombed-out nocturnal settings, and Pope bathes different scenes in harsh, abrasive color schemes. The wide-angled point of view shots from the perspective of the craw have an avant-garde quality. You don't need to have seen "The Crow" to appreciate "The Crow: City of Angeles."

    The Crow: City of Angels (1996) * 1/2 (out of 4) A vicious drug dealer (Richard Brooks) has mechanic Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) killed along with his wife and young son. A year later the crow leads the mechanic back from the dead for revenge. Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination. The lack of imagination is something that can be said about the majority of this film as this sequel just never gets off the ground.

    Ah, 1996's "The Crow: City of Angels"- the first sequel in the downfall of a once-promising franchise. Directed by Tim Pope and written by David S. Goyer (whom both went on to disown the film due to studio re-edits that destroyed it), this is the tragic misstep that destroyed the series after the incredible 1994 debut. Vincent Perez stars as Ashe, a man whom was murdered, along with his child, after witnessing a gang-related hit. Some time later (it's never exactly established, but I think it's a short time later), Ashe is brought back by the power of a crow, to seek vengeance. He is helped along the way by Sarah... yes, the same Sarah from the first film, now all grown up and quite stunning (portrayed by the sexy Mia Kirshner). She uses Eric Draven's influence on her to paint the iconic crow makeup onto Ashe and send him on his way, also acting as a slight love interest in the rushed narrative. Ashe is after Judah (Richard Brooks), the drug lord of Los Angelas, who is sort of responsible for the loss of his own life and that of his child. Judah's men (including Thomas Jane, Iggy Pop and the late and great Thuy Trang) are the ones who murdered him. Through a bizarre series of events that just don't "gel" together properly, Judah forms a plan to steal the powers of the crow to make himself invincible, and Ashe must stop him at all costs. To give credit where it is due, there are some good aspects to the film. For starters, Pope's direction is quite nice, on the whole. He went for what seems to be the exact opposite of what Alex Proyas did with the first film. The movie is all in shades of red, orange, purple, etc. It's much harsher and more angry, and camera-work is generally good. Graeme Revell also returns to score the film, and he utilizes a fantastic combination of new themes with musical cues from the prior film. It helps ground them both in the same universe. And the performances aren't bad. However, it stops there. The films really, truly suffers from the studio re-edits. Rumor has it that the original cut of the film was much longer and significantly different, but Miramax, wanting to cash in on the success of the first film, had more than an hour of footage cut, and many scenes re-arranged in the narrative, in order to make it more like the original. And it shows. The pacing is sloppy and characters are left completely undeveloped. In addition, the tragedy and connection to the characters is also severed, and the ending (without spoiling anything) makes no sense whatsoever. The film feels like it's missing the backbone to the story, and what's left after these studio edits feels like an empty shell. It's barely watchable as-is, and isn't very enjoyable. Here's to hoping that one day, we may get the original cut of the film (which isn't the DVD Director's Cut, don't be fooled), and see this film in the best possible way, as the original cut does sound far superior. As it stands, "The Crow: City of Angels" gets a 3 out of 10. It's a worse version of the original film, and should be skipped over by all but die-hard fans who feel they need to see it.

    naturally this movie was not going to live up to the original which is a classic. But, it has its good points. the set up was done well with the murder of the man and son enhanced by good cinematography. I also think the landscape was done well creating a post apocalyptic feel. i think in my eyes the best scene was when the crow retrieves his son from the river and buries him which was enhanced by music from the original crow(best scene id say). the bad points for me was character based, the crow's dialogue and witty remarks i found were not effective. the villains (besides Iggy pop who i think did well) were portrayed weak and not in depth. Main bad point for me was a real weak ending where the crow summons crows to fly through him and destroy the immortal bad guy. thought that was i really poor written ending. I suppose as this was a sequel they couldn't make the concept as subtle as the first one without completely replicating it. still it was enjoyable to watch again after 14 years. probably wont be watching any time soon again tho. oh and at least it didn't have Tara Reid

    Some time ago, Ashe Corven and his son Danny were killed when they stumbled across a pack of drug dealers murdering a fellow dealer. The dealers work for Los Angeles drug kingpin Judah. Local tattoo artist Sarah, who has great knowledge of the crow legend because of what happened with her late friend, has been having dreams about Ashe and Danny. One night when a crow leads her to the scene of the murders of Ashe and Danny, Ashe appears before her. The crow has resurrected Ashe, so Ashe can go after Judah and his right hand man Curve. With the guidance of the crow, Ashe starts killing off Judah's men one by one, on his way to Judah. Yes, many think that this film is sacrilege and trounces on Lees grave, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel, very dark, and seems very visceral at times. I love the first movie, it has that tone to it and obviously what happened to Lee makes the film more poignant and essential. It was inevitable that there was going to be a sequel as the film shouts our franchise, whether you like it or not. Perez is obviously no Lee, but he wasn't supposed to be, he is his own 'Crow' ans this film has more of a paternal feel to it, rather than the dark romanticism of the first. And this is where the film usurps the first, the villains in this are more entertaining, even if they are over the top and more theatrical. Judah though, isn't a patch on Top Dollar, but has some good scenes and hilarious dialogue. So all in all it's a sequel, but a heavily underrated one, thanks to obsessed fans of the first who dismissed this. The set pieces are great, the soundtrack as dark as the first, and a whole 'dusk' vibe throughout the whole movie. It's obviously directed by a music video director, as the editing is sharp and some of the cinematography is stark. It's okay to say that this movie is good, you won't offend anyone, or lose the mysticism of the original.

    I wish you could give negative ratings. This is awful, a film without redeeming features. Let's list them. Story - 100% copy Bad Guy - Pathetic Good Guy - An shambolic shadow of Eric Draven Aesthetics - not sure was too dark to see anything. The Crow is one of a few films I would give 10/10 to. As such it is obviously one of my all time favourites. This is my actual least fave film and it includes films I couldn't watch in their entirety such as the original Re-Hash of The Hulk or recently Barbarossa! There is no reason at all to watch this film. it's not camp and therefore funny. It is not ironic, self deprecating or even a decent stand alone flick. Its appalling. Watch something else

    To be honest, this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets. The visuals are amazing, and the city feels fleshed out. It really feels like you're in a drug infested Los Angeles in the middle of the 90's, something the first film achieved greatly. They didn't go cheesy with this movie as much as they did the titles that followed it (with Ed Furlong and the other guy), but people still see it as a remake. It's actually a sequel, with a more pure love in my opinion than the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, try to watch it with an open mind. Vincent Perez does a great job as the lead role, and completely steals the spotlight from everyone else in the film. It's worth watching for him alone.
