    I remember watching this movie as a kid, and the most beautiful thing about movies like this is how you learn something every time watching it as you get older. This movie is not just about a cure, but a passionate and devoted friendship between an innocent sick boy named Dexter and his neighbour Eric. As the movie begins, you will see how fast kids perspectives change once they realize that their actions may hurt them for the rest of their lives. You will also realize how much symbolism is involved in the entire film. It's these kinds of movies that make us feel very insightful and want to discuss the meanings behind the symbolism. Of course, we also learn about a real truthful friendship and what it really takes to be a good person in someone's life and how people become when they realize that life can be short and we want to be remembered for all our characteristics. I have to say, this movie was exceptionally done. Every single scene I had my eyes wide open or tearing up over a heart touching scene. I was in awe at every part. If you like a good moral, clean, sad drama film with a lot of symbolism, this movie is highly recommended for you. Enjoy it because it is one of the most greatest movies, without a doubt!

    An early film on AIDS but the case considered here makes the subject extremely tender and touching. It is an 11 year old BOY who has AIDS and got it from some medical treatment. That was common at the beginning of the epidemic. Of course some neighbourhood kids accuse the child of being gay with nice words like "fag" thrown at him as if it could in anyway be possible. But the interest of the film is the relationship this sick child, Dexter, is going to build with his next door neighbour who is slightly older but alone with his mother like Dexter. This neighbour, Erik, is looking for a friend for the summer and he assumes the situation in which Dexter is naturally but with a tremendous optimism trying by all means to find a cure in some plants, concocting all kinds of potions for his friend. But the best side of the story is how these two boys develop a loving relationship that makes them adventurous, courageous, even reckless, just to get a cure for the disease or to get to New Orleans where there supposedly is some doctor who would have a cure. The whole adventure becomes some kind of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer down the Mississippi all over again, though in slightly different conditions. This love between the two boys is in fact a threesome in a way since there is always a third character, the disease itself that haunts Dexter, that possesses Dexter and at the same time that entirely controls Erik, his reactions, his care, his tricks and pranks on nurses and doctors. Erik's mother is just a prop but Dexter's mother is also extremely important in her patience, in the way she accompanies Dexter to his final destination and accepts the love between the two boys and the silly antics they do together just because it might be the last chance Dexter has to experience some pleasure, some happiness. And the end is a miracle in a way. The two boys decide to play a trick on a doctor again, Dexter pretending he is dead in order to resuscitate and frighten the doctor. But that was one time too many and this time the doctor confirms the diagnosis which is this time no longer a trick. That kind of end is so cool, so natural, so peaceful we just wonder if that is not the miracle a doctor spoke of before: going out on tiptoe as discreetly as possible like an angel in the sky. Those two boys and Dexter's mother seem to give us a tremendous lesson when we are confronted to a disease that does not want to be cured. Patience, calm and receptivity seem to be the needed cure when there is no other. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Let me start out with saying I was VERY surprised with the production value of this movie. I managed to catch an early showing and I have to Say this is the BEST (if not only) Christian film to hit theaters since The Passion. Don't let the PG-13 rating scare you off, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film (divorce, teen pregnancy, drug use, and suicide), but nothing in the film is gratuitous. This is definitely a movie that a Junior High youth group could see without upsetting (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is this is not a film FOR Christians, it is a Family film without the cheesy 7th Heaven feel. The laughs are there, and several times in the theater everyone was laughing, the bits of humor were natural and didn't seem scripted or forced, and that made for good pacing in such a serious film. Teens and young adult, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film. The plot is not in any way predictable, and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit. Christians, fortunately, are not shown as all mighty know it all's of "The Word", but instead people just trying to understand life. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot. The acting is top notch, the writing spot on, and you aren't hit over the head with all the preachy Christian rhetoric. This is a great film that will make you and your teens think, talk, and perhaps question their own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a quality family film in January check your local listings for this film, and you might learn something about yourself. And I am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie.

    "The Cure" is one of the few movies I gave a flawless score. It is one of the most deeply touching movies of all time. The story is so well-developed that we witness gradual shifts from absolute happiness to absolute sadness. In the process of this, however, it manages to attach an important message throughout the movie, which is the message of hope. The script is powerful enough to make the audience laugh and cry, and sometimes both at the same time. The acting is simply superb from two amazing boy actors, strengthening the power of this masterpiece. "The Cure" is a masterpiece that combines simplicity, funny elements, deeply touching moments, the essence of having hope and the power and meaning of friendship. It is going to leave a mark in your heart that you will carry forever. - dchgl.blogspot.com

    This film was made at a time when there wasn't a great deal of knowledge about AIDS and as a result there was a lot of misinformation and fear about the disease. This was, therefore, a courageous film, dealing with a very delicate subject matter. Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) is an 11 year old suffering from AIDS that was transmitted through a blood transfusion. Because of the disease, he's isolated and has no friends, but he does have a loving and attentive mother (Annabella Sciorra.) After moving into a new neighbourhood, Dexter suddenly has a next door neighbour named Erik (Brad Renfro.) At first, Brad wants nothing to do with Dexter, but gradually they develop a close friendship, much to the displeasure of Erik's less than attentive mother (Diana Scarwid.) The movie revolves around the attempt by the two boys to travel form their home in Minnesota to New Orleans, where they've heard that a doctor has developed a cure for AIDS. We follow their adventure and their growing friendship along the way, until Dexter becomes too ill to continue, which leads to the sad conclusion of the movie. This is a moving story, which isn't built around action or excitement but rather revolves at a leisurely and low-key pace around the friendship between Erik and Dexter. It's a solid testimony to the importance of both friendship and hope, and the impact that both have, summed up by Dexter's mother near the end of the movie. When Erik laments that they hadn't found the cure, she tells him that they did, because before Erik appeared, Dexter's life had been sad, and Erik changed that. This isn't as much of a tearjerker as I thought it might be, but it's touching. (6/10)

    People can be so mean, so selfish, so unfair, so ignorant! How would you feel if you had AIDS and were mocked, despised, bullied and treated like crap just because of the illness and even go as far as consider it a disease only for homosexuals and transmittable through the air? Do these people ever stop to rethink and think of the person they are treating as one apart? As if that wasn't enough, they go even farther by calling "faggot" to that person's neighbor. If it was like this in 1995, today it's much worse. Unlike the more popular but overrated 'Philadelphia' (with the no less overrated actor Tom Hanks), this one is not boring or dull, it's a really good movie. 'The Cure' is a movie that makes you feel good under tragic circumstances! It shows that anyone of us can bring happiness to a fragile person who is suffering from a terminal disease and treat and respect him/her well. If we really want to, we can do it. A disease is no reason to judge someone, what matters is the personality. I really think we all can learn a lot from this film. This unfortunate world and society needs more "Dexters" and "Eriks". This is the story of Dexter, a kid with a heart of gold who has AIDS (which he got from a blood transfusion). His older neighbor Erik quickly becomes his best friend, his idol, his hero and his protector. Erik idolizes him and his mother as well, as Erik has the curse of having a horrible mother. The two boys's quest to find a cure for Dexter's disease is a failure, but at least Erik managed to bring much joy for Dexter's difficult life and was the best thing that ever happened to him. The ending is sad. Dexter doesn't make it. But in real life the actor who portrayed Erik died. Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello illuminate the screen with their amazing performances. They make the movie as good as it is. It owes a lot to these two young talented artists. This should definitely be on Top 250.

    'The Cure' is a touching film about a true friendship. A friendship that exceeds all of the preconceptions. I agree that this is a tale of happiness under tragic circumstances. Plus, it portrays an ignorant side of society. Many believe that AIDS is strictly a "gay" disease and transmittable through the air and mock and treat miserably those who have it. This movie can teach us all many lessons and morals. This story is about two unlucky boys with different personalities and some problems in common (both are rejected and unwelcome by society). Erik is, I assume, 12 years old (like Brad Renfro himself back then), an easy target for a bunch of dorks and his mother is a horrible person and ignorant (and so is his unseen grandmother). Erik's neighbor Dexter is 11 (like Joseph Mazzello at the time). Dexter has a loving mother but he is a cursed child. He is very nice and sweet but he got AIDS from a blood transfusion when he was a baby and just because of his illness he is treated by the ignorants as if he was a plague. This is Dexter's drama. Poor Dexter! Erik and Dexter got off to a bad start but Erik quickly learns to like and respect Dexter and they become great friends. Together they live adventures and moments of fun and happiness at the same time they attempt to find a cure to save Dexter. Their friendship has no boundaries and both find out they're braver than they ever imagined, as their courage helps them in sticky situations. Erik gives Dexter a chance to live life as it should be lived. There is a number of heartwarming moments, such as the scene when Erik gives his tennis shoe to Dexter to comfort him and make him feel safer. Another part that gets me every time is the tense sequence when Dexter stabs his hand and says the haunting line &laquo;My blood is like poison&raquo; and gets far weaker after this bravery act and has to be taken to a hospital. During Dexter's stay at the hospital, there are some fun moments which serve as a perfect comic relief under a tragic circumstance. The boys prank the doctors that Dexter is unconscious in two occasions. Dexter scares the hell out of the doctors and laughs a lot. But in a 3rd attempt to prank them, when Erik asks Dexter &laquo;Are you ready for another victim?&raquo; and Dexter smiles and nods "Yes", the sad irony is that Dexter no longer wakes up. The cure is not found. The nice tyke doesn't make it. The two boys take the movie all by themselves and shine like stars: Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazzello as Dexter. Brad Renfro was talented and always looked mature for his age. That and the fact that his voice sounded mature for the age made him look some years older than he really was. Shame he did put himself in a bad spot few years after this movie was made and passed away early. Joseph Mazzello always proved to be a fine young actor. He is simply wonderful in this serious role. And he was a very cute kid and had the cutest and most adorable voice, along with Judith Barsi. Annabella Sciorra's acting as Linda also deserves my praise. The soundtrack is worth of my praise too, it sounds so peaceful-minded, fits perfectly in the mood of the film. This movie is a classic, deserves much better luck than it got. Title in Portugal: 'La&ccedil;os de Amizade'.

    Such an awesome movie -- I was transfixed the entire time and so emotionally overcome in the end! The two young male actors in the movie were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support of one another was quite believable and I thought the comparison/contrast between their respective home lives vs. health situations were made so very real between them. The success in bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort so to actors, EP's, producers, writers, directors, and all of production I say, "WELL PLAYED!" Having missed the credits at the beginning of the movie (it was being shown on HBO), I was so very surprised that I had to actually research (albeit briefly) the internet in order to find the title of this movie -- something so great should have been known by me -- a clear indication that this movie must be re-released!

    So glad I have HBO right now. I didn't plan on watching a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next movie on HBO was this one I decided (based on the description) to at least give it a shot. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment (I'm a little stressed out, got a huge test to be studying for), but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy. I'm currently one year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me! Anyhow, I just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed. There is definitely something for everyone in this movie!

    When the movie "The Cure" starts, we find out about a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother, and living next door to him is a young boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day, Erik and Dexter connect and head up to the supermarket, where Dexter gets his first taste of Butterfinger. When Erik learns out that Dexter has AIDS, he tries leaves-and-water tea to make it better. But when the front cover of The National Enquirer says a New Orleans doctor has found the cure for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans for the cure. In my opinion, "The Cure" is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made. It shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend, and his best friend's mom. Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. Not only do I give this a 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, but it also is a sad, but humorous, and fun AIDS movie. And the tragic finale with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed a tear. Very well done.

The two boys's quest to find a cure for Dexter's disease is a failure, but at least Erik managed to bring much joy for Dexter's difficult life and was the best thing that ever happened to him. The ending is sad. Dexter doesn't make it. But in real life the actor who portrayed Erik died. Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello illuminate the screen with their amazing performances. They make the movie as good as it is. It owes a lot to these two young talented artists. This should definitely be on Top 250.

    'The Cure' is a touching film about a true friendship. A friendship that exceeds all of the preconceptions. I agree that this is a tale of happiness under tragic circumstances. Plus, it portrays an ignorant side of society. Many believe that AIDS is strictly a "gay" disease and transmittable through the air and mock and treat miserably those who have it. This movie can teach us all many lessons and morals. This story is about two unlucky boys with different personalities and some problems in common (both are rejected and unwelcome by society). Erik is, I assume, 12 years old (like Brad Renfro himself back then), an easy target for a bunch of dorks and his mother is a horrible person and ignorant (and so is his unseen grandmother). Erik's neighbor Dexter is 11 (like Joseph Mazzello at the time). Dexter has a loving mother but he is a cursed child. He is very nice and sweet but he got AIDS from a blood transfusion when he was a baby and just because of his illness he is treated by the ignorants as if he was a plague. This is Dexter's drama. Poor Dexter! Erik and Dexter got off to a bad start but Erik quickly learns to like and respect Dexter and they become great friends. Together they live adventures and moments of fun and happiness at the same time they attempt to find a cure to save Dexter. Their friendship has no boundaries and both find out they're braver than they ever imagined, as their courage helps them in sticky situations. Erik gives Dexter a chance to live life as it should be lived. There is a number of heartwarming moments, such as the scene when Erik gives his tennis shoe to Dexter to comfort him and make him feel safer. Another part that gets me every time is the tense sequence when Dexter stabs his hand and says the haunting line &laquo;My blood is like poison&raquo; and gets far weaker after this bravery act and has to be taken to a hospital. During Dexter's stay at the hospital, there are some fun moments which serve as a perfect comic relief under a tragic circumstance. The boys prank the doctors that Dexter is unconscious in two occasions. Dexter scares the hell out of the doctors and laughs a lot. But in a 3rd attempt to prank them, when Erik asks Dexter &laquo;Are you ready for another victim?&raquo; and Dexter smiles and nods "Yes", the sad irony is that Dexter no longer wakes up. The cure is not found. The nice tyke doesn't make it. The two boys take the movie all by themselves and shine like stars: Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazzello as Dexter. Brad Renfro was talented and always looked mature for his age. That and the fact that his voice sounded mature for the age made him look some years older than he really was. Shame he did put himself in a bad spot few years after this movie was made and passed away early. Joseph Mazzello always proved to be a fine young actor. He is simply wonderful in this serious role. And he was a very cute kid and had the cutest and most adorable voice, along with Judith Barsi. Annabella Sciorra's acting as Linda also deserves my praise. The soundtrack is worth of my praise too, it sounds so peaceful-minded, fits perfectly in the mood of the film. This movie is a classic, deserves much better luck than it got. Title in Portugal: 'La&ccedil;os de Amizade'.

    Such an awesome movie -- I was transfixed the entire time and so emotionally overcome in the end! The two young male actors in the movie were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support of one another was quite believable and I thought the comparison/contrast between their respective home lives vs. health situations were made so very real between them. The success in bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort so to actors, EP's, producers, writers, directors, and all of production I say, "WELL PLAYED!" Having missed the credits at the beginning of the movie (it was being shown on HBO), I was so very surprised that I had to actually research (albeit briefly) the internet in order to find the title of this movie -- something so great should have been known by me -- a clear indication that this movie must be re-released!

    So glad I have HBO right now. I didn't plan on watching a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next movie on HBO was this one I decided (based on the description) to at least give it a shot. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment (I'm a little stressed out, got a huge test to be studying for), but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy. I'm currently one year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me! Anyhow, I just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed. There is definitely something for everyone in this movie!

    When the movie "The Cure" starts, we find out about a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother, and living next door to him is a young boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day, Erik and Dexter connect and head up to the supermarket, where Dexter gets his first taste of Butterfinger. When Erik learns out that Dexter has AIDS, he tries leaves-and-water tea to make it better. But when the front cover of The National Enquirer says a New Orleans doctor has found the cure for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans for the cure. In my opinion, "The Cure" is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made. It shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend, and his best friend's mom. Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. Not only do I give this a 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, but it also is a sad, but humorous, and fun AIDS movie. And the tragic finale with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed a tear. Very well done.

    I remember watching this movie as a kid, and the most beautiful thing about movies like this is how you learn something every time watching it as you get older. This movie is not just about a cure, but a passionate and devoted friendship between an innocent sick boy named Dexter and his neighbour Eric. As the movie begins, you will see how fast kids perspectives change once they realize that their actions may hurt them for the rest of their lives. You will also realize how much symbolism is involved in the entire film. It's these kinds of movies that make us feel very insightful and want to discuss the meanings behind the symbolism. Of course, we also learn about a real truthful friendship and what it really takes to be a good person in someone's life and how people become when they realize that life can be short and we want to be remembered for all our characteristics. I have to say, this movie was exceptionally done. Every single scene I had my eyes wide open or tearing up over a heart touching scene. I was in awe at every part. If you like a good moral, clean, sad drama film with a lot of symbolism, this movie is highly recommended for you. Enjoy it because it is one of the most greatest movies, without a doubt!

    An early film on AIDS but the case considered here makes the subject extremely tender and touching. It is an 11 year old BOY who has AIDS and got it from some medical treatment. That was common at the beginning of the epidemic. Of course some neighbourhood kids accuse the child of being gay with nice words like "fag" thrown at him as if it could in anyway be possible. But the interest of the film is the relationship this sick child, Dexter, is going to build with his next door neighbour who is slightly older but alone with his mother like Dexter. This neighbour, Erik, is looking for a friend for the summer and he assumes the situation in which Dexter is naturally but with a tremendous optimism trying by all means to find a cure in some plants, concocting all kinds of potions for his friend. But the best side of the story is how these two boys develop a loving relationship that makes them adventurous, courageous, even reckless, just to get a cure for the disease or to get to New Orleans where there supposedly is some doctor who would have a cure. The whole adventure becomes some kind of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer down the Mississippi all over again, though in slightly different conditions. This love between the two boys is in fact a threesome in a way since there is always a third character, the disease itself that haunts Dexter, that possesses Dexter and at the same time that entirely controls Erik, his reactions, his care, his tricks and pranks on nurses and doctors. Erik's mother is just a prop but Dexter's mother is also extremely important in her patience, in the way she accompanies Dexter to his final destination and accepts the love between the two boys and the silly antics they do together just because it might be the last chance Dexter has to experience some pleasure, some happiness. And the end is a miracle in a way. The two boys decide to play a trick on a doctor again, Dexter pretending he is dead in order to resuscitate and frighten the doctor. But that was one time too many and this time the doctor confirms the diagnosis which is this time no longer a trick. That kind of end is so cool, so natural, so peaceful we just wonder if that is not the miracle a doctor spoke of before: going out on tiptoe as discreetly as possible like an angel in the sky. Those two boys and Dexter's mother seem to give us a tremendous lesson when we are confronted to a disease that does not want to be cured. Patience, calm and receptivity seem to be the needed cure when there is no other. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Let me start out with saying I was VERY surprised with the production value of this movie. I managed to catch an early showing and I have to Say this is the BEST (if not only) Christian film to hit theaters since The Passion. Don't let the PG-13 rating scare you off, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film (divorce, teen pregnancy, drug use, and suicide), but nothing in the film is gratuitous. This is definitely a movie that a Junior High youth group could see without upsetting (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is this is not a film FOR Christians, it is a Family film without the cheesy 7th Heaven feel. The laughs are there, and several times in the theater everyone was laughing, the bits of humor were natural and didn't seem scripted or forced, and that made for good pacing in such a serious film. Teens and young adult, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film. The plot is not in any way predictable, and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit. Christians, fortunately, are not shown as all mighty know it all's of "The Word", but instead people just trying to understand life. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot. The acting is top notch, the writing spot on, and you aren't hit over the head with all the preachy Christian rhetoric. This is a great film that will make you and your teens think, talk, and perhaps question their own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a quality family film in January check your local listings for this film, and you might learn something about yourself. And I am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie.

    "The Cure" is one of the few movies I gave a flawless score. It is one of the most deeply touching movies of all time. The story is so well-developed that we witness gradual shifts from absolute happiness to absolute sadness. In the process of this, however, it manages to attach an important message throughout the movie, which is the message of hope. The script is powerful enough to make the audience laugh and cry, and sometimes both at the same time. The acting is simply superb from two amazing boy actors, strengthening the power of this masterpiece. "The Cure" is a masterpiece that combines simplicity, funny elements, deeply touching moments, the essence of having hope and the power and meaning of friendship. It is going to leave a mark in your heart that you will carry forever. - dchgl.blogspot.com

    This film was made at a time when there wasn't a great deal of knowledge about AIDS and as a result there was a lot of misinformation and fear about the disease. This was, therefore, a courageous film, dealing with a very delicate subject matter. Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) is an 11 year old suffering from AIDS that was transmitted through a blood transfusion. Because of the disease, he's isolated and has no friends, but he does have a loving and attentive mother (Annabella Sciorra.) After moving into a new neighbourhood, Dexter suddenly has a next door neighbour named Erik (Brad Renfro.) At first, Brad wants nothing to do with Dexter, but gradually they develop a close friendship, much to the displeasure of Erik's less than attentive mother (Diana Scarwid.) The movie revolves around the attempt by the two boys to travel form their home in Minnesota to New Orleans, where they've heard that a doctor has developed a cure for AIDS. We follow their adventure and their growing friendship along the way, until Dexter becomes too ill to continue, which leads to the sad conclusion of the movie. This is a moving story, which isn't built around action or excitement but rather revolves at a leisurely and low-key pace around the friendship between Erik and Dexter. It's a solid testimony to the importance of both friendship and hope, and the impact that both have, summed up by Dexter's mother near the end of the movie. When Erik laments that they hadn't found the cure, she tells him that they did, because before Erik appeared, Dexter's life had been sad, and Erik changed that. This isn't as much of a tearjerker as I thought it might be, but it's touching. (6/10)

    People can be so mean, so selfish, so unfair, so ignorant! How would you feel if you had AIDS and were mocked, despised, bullied and treated like crap just because of the illness and even go as far as consider it a disease only for homosexuals and transmittable through the air? Do these people ever stop to rethink and think of the person they are treating as one apart? As if that wasn't enough, they go even farther by calling "faggot" to that person's neighbor. If it was like this in 1995, today it's much worse. Unlike the more popular but overrated 'Philadelphia' (with the no less overrated actor Tom Hanks), this one is not boring or dull, it's a really good movie. 'The Cure' is a movie that makes you feel good under tragic circumstances! It shows that anyone of us can bring happiness to a fragile person who is suffering from a terminal disease and treat and respect him/her well. If we really want to, we can do it. A disease is no reason to judge someone, what matters is the personality. I really think we all can learn a lot from this film. This unfortunate world and society needs more "Dexters" and "Eriks". This is the story of Dexter, a kid with a heart of gold who has AIDS (which he got from a blood transfusion). His older neighbor Erik quickly becomes his best friend, his idol, his hero and his protector. Erik idolizes him and his mother as well, as Erik has the curse of having a horrible mother. The two boys's quest to find a cure for Dexter's disease is a failure, but at least Erik managed to bring much joy for Dexter's difficult life and was the best thing that ever happened to him. The ending is sad. Dexter doesn't make it. But in real life the actor who portrayed Erik died. Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello illuminate the screen with their amazing performances. They make the movie as good as it is. It owes a lot to these two young talented artists. This should definitely be on Top 250.

The plot is not in any way predictable, and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit. Christians, fortunately, are not shown as all mighty know it all's of "The Word", but instead people just trying to understand life. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot. The acting is top notch, the writing spot on, and you aren't hit over the head with all the preachy Christian rhetoric. This is a great film that will make you and your teens think, talk, and perhaps question their own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a quality family film in January check your local listings for this film, and you might learn something about yourself. And I am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie.

    "The Cure" is one of the few movies I gave a flawless score. It is one of the most deeply touching movies of all time. The story is so well-developed that we witness gradual shifts from absolute happiness to absolute sadness. In the process of this, however, it manages to attach an important message throughout the movie, which is the message of hope. The script is powerful enough to make the audience laugh and cry, and sometimes both at the same time. The acting is simply superb from two amazing boy actors, strengthening the power of this masterpiece. "The Cure" is a masterpiece that combines simplicity, funny elements, deeply touching moments, the essence of having hope and the power and meaning of friendship. It is going to leave a mark in your heart that you will carry forever. - dchgl.blogspot.com

    This film was made at a time when there wasn't a great deal of knowledge about AIDS and as a result there was a lot of misinformation and fear about the disease. This was, therefore, a courageous film, dealing with a very delicate subject matter. Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) is an 11 year old suffering from AIDS that was transmitted through a blood transfusion. Because of the disease, he's isolated and has no friends, but he does have a loving and attentive mother (Annabella Sciorra.) After moving into a new neighbourhood, Dexter suddenly has a next door neighbour named Erik (Brad Renfro.) At first, Brad wants nothing to do with Dexter, but gradually they develop a close friendship, much to the displeasure of Erik's less than attentive mother (Diana Scarwid.) The movie revolves around the attempt by the two boys to travel form their home in Minnesota to New Orleans, where they've heard that a doctor has developed a cure for AIDS. We follow their adventure and their growing friendship along the way, until Dexter becomes too ill to continue, which leads to the sad conclusion of the movie. This is a moving story, which isn't built around action or excitement but rather revolves at a leisurely and low-key pace around the friendship between Erik and Dexter. It's a solid testimony to the importance of both friendship and hope, and the impact that both have, summed up by Dexter's mother near the end of the movie. When Erik laments that they hadn't found the cure, she tells him that they did, because before Erik appeared, Dexter's life had been sad, and Erik changed that. This isn't as much of a tearjerker as I thought it might be, but it's touching. (6/10)

    People can be so mean, so selfish, so unfair, so ignorant! How would you feel if you had AIDS and were mocked, despised, bullied and treated like crap just because of the illness and even go as far as consider it a disease only for homosexuals and transmittable through the air? Do these people ever stop to rethink and think of the person they are treating as one apart? As if that wasn't enough, they go even farther by calling "faggot" to that person's neighbor. If it was like this in 1995, today it's much worse. Unlike the more popular but overrated 'Philadelphia' (with the no less overrated actor Tom Hanks), this one is not boring or dull, it's a really good movie. 'The Cure' is a movie that makes you feel good under tragic circumstances! It shows that anyone of us can bring happiness to a fragile person who is suffering from a terminal disease and treat and respect him/her well. If we really want to, we can do it. A disease is no reason to judge someone, what matters is the personality. I really think we all can learn a lot from this film. This unfortunate world and society needs more "Dexters" and "Eriks". This is the story of Dexter, a kid with a heart of gold who has AIDS (which he got from a blood transfusion). His older neighbor Erik quickly becomes his best friend, his idol, his hero and his protector. Erik idolizes him and his mother as well, as Erik has the curse of having a horrible mother. The two boys's quest to find a cure for Dexter's disease is a failure, but at least Erik managed to bring much joy for Dexter's difficult life and was the best thing that ever happened to him. The ending is sad. Dexter doesn't make it. But in real life the actor who portrayed Erik died. Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello illuminate the screen with their amazing performances. They make the movie as good as it is. It owes a lot to these two young talented artists. This should definitely be on Top 250.

    'The Cure' is a touching film about a true friendship. A friendship that exceeds all of the preconceptions. I agree that this is a tale of happiness under tragic circumstances. Plus, it portrays an ignorant side of society. Many believe that AIDS is strictly a "gay" disease and transmittable through the air and mock and treat miserably those who have it. This movie can teach us all many lessons and morals. This story is about two unlucky boys with different personalities and some problems in common (both are rejected and unwelcome by society). Erik is, I assume, 12 years old (like Brad Renfro himself back then), an easy target for a bunch of dorks and his mother is a horrible person and ignorant (and so is his unseen grandmother). Erik's neighbor Dexter is 11 (like Joseph Mazzello at the time). Dexter has a loving mother but he is a cursed child. He is very nice and sweet but he got AIDS from a blood transfusion when he was a baby and just because of his illness he is treated by the ignorants as if he was a plague. This is Dexter's drama. Poor Dexter! Erik and Dexter got off to a bad start but Erik quickly learns to like and respect Dexter and they become great friends. Together they live adventures and moments of fun and happiness at the same time they attempt to find a cure to save Dexter. Their friendship has no boundaries and both find out they're braver than they ever imagined, as their courage helps them in sticky situations. Erik gives Dexter a chance to live life as it should be lived. There is a number of heartwarming moments, such as the scene when Erik gives his tennis shoe to Dexter to comfort him and make him feel safer. Another part that gets me every time is the tense sequence when Dexter stabs his hand and says the haunting line &laquo;My blood is like poison&raquo; and gets far weaker after this bravery act and has to be taken to a hospital. During Dexter's stay at the hospital, there are some fun moments which serve as a perfect comic relief under a tragic circumstance. The boys prank the doctors that Dexter is unconscious in two occasions. Dexter scares the hell out of the doctors and laughs a lot. But in a 3rd attempt to prank them, when Erik asks Dexter &laquo;Are you ready for another victim?&raquo; and Dexter smiles and nods "Yes", the sad irony is that Dexter no longer wakes up. The cure is not found. The nice tyke doesn't make it. The two boys take the movie all by themselves and shine like stars: Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazzello as Dexter. Brad Renfro was talented and always looked mature for his age. That and the fact that his voice sounded mature for the age made him look some years older than he really was. Shame he did put himself in a bad spot few years after this movie was made and passed away early. Joseph Mazzello always proved to be a fine young actor. He is simply wonderful in this serious role. And he was a very cute kid and had the cutest and most adorable voice, along with Judith Barsi. Annabella Sciorra's acting as Linda also deserves my praise. The soundtrack is worth of my praise too, it sounds so peaceful-minded, fits perfectly in the mood of the film. This movie is a classic, deserves much better luck than it got. Title in Portugal: 'La&ccedil;os de Amizade'.

    Such an awesome movie -- I was transfixed the entire time and so emotionally overcome in the end! The two young male actors in the movie were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support of one another was quite believable and I thought the comparison/contrast between their respective home lives vs. health situations were made so very real between them. The success in bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort so to actors, EP's, producers, writers, directors, and all of production I say, "WELL PLAYED!" Having missed the credits at the beginning of the movie (it was being shown on HBO), I was so very surprised that I had to actually research (albeit briefly) the internet in order to find the title of this movie -- something so great should have been known by me -- a clear indication that this movie must be re-released!

    So glad I have HBO right now. I didn't plan on watching a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next movie on HBO was this one I decided (based on the description) to at least give it a shot. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment (I'm a little stressed out, got a huge test to be studying for), but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy. I'm currently one year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me! Anyhow, I just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed. There is definitely something for everyone in this movie!

    When the movie "The Cure" starts, we find out about a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother, and living next door to him is a young boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day, Erik and Dexter connect and head up to the supermarket, where Dexter gets his first taste of Butterfinger. When Erik learns out that Dexter has AIDS, he tries leaves-and-water tea to make it better. But when the front cover of The National Enquirer says a New Orleans doctor has found the cure for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans for the cure. In my opinion, "The Cure" is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made. It shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend, and his best friend's mom. Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. Not only do I give this a 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, but it also is a sad, but humorous, and fun AIDS movie. And the tragic finale with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed a tear. Very well done.

    I remember watching this movie as a kid, and the most beautiful thing about movies like this is how you learn something every time watching it as you get older. This movie is not just about a cure, but a passionate and devoted friendship between an innocent sick boy named Dexter and his neighbour Eric. As the movie begins, you will see how fast kids perspectives change once they realize that their actions may hurt them for the rest of their lives. You will also realize how much symbolism is involved in the entire film. It's these kinds of movies that make us feel very insightful and want to discuss the meanings behind the symbolism. Of course, we also learn about a real truthful friendship and what it really takes to be a good person in someone's life and how people become when they realize that life can be short and we want to be remembered for all our characteristics. I have to say, this movie was exceptionally done. Every single scene I had my eyes wide open or tearing up over a heart touching scene. I was in awe at every part. If you like a good moral, clean, sad drama film with a lot of symbolism, this movie is highly recommended for you. Enjoy it because it is one of the most greatest movies, without a doubt!

    An early film on AIDS but the case considered here makes the subject extremely tender and touching. It is an 11 year old BOY who has AIDS and got it from some medical treatment. That was common at the beginning of the epidemic. Of course some neighbourhood kids accuse the child of being gay with nice words like "fag" thrown at him as if it could in anyway be possible. But the interest of the film is the relationship this sick child, Dexter, is going to build with his next door neighbour who is slightly older but alone with his mother like Dexter. This neighbour, Erik, is looking for a friend for the summer and he assumes the situation in which Dexter is naturally but with a tremendous optimism trying by all means to find a cure in some plants, concocting all kinds of potions for his friend. But the best side of the story is how these two boys develop a loving relationship that makes them adventurous, courageous, even reckless, just to get a cure for the disease or to get to New Orleans where there supposedly is some doctor who would have a cure. The whole adventure becomes some kind of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer down the Mississippi all over again, though in slightly different conditions. This love between the two boys is in fact a threesome in a way since there is always a third character, the disease itself that haunts Dexter, that possesses Dexter and at the same time that entirely controls Erik, his reactions, his care, his tricks and pranks on nurses and doctors. Erik's mother is just a prop but Dexter's mother is also extremely important in her patience, in the way she accompanies Dexter to his final destination and accepts the love between the two boys and the silly antics they do together just because it might be the last chance Dexter has to experience some pleasure, some happiness. And the end is a miracle in a way. The two boys decide to play a trick on a doctor again, Dexter pretending he is dead in order to resuscitate and frighten the doctor. But that was one time too many and this time the doctor confirms the diagnosis which is this time no longer a trick. That kind of end is so cool, so natural, so peaceful we just wonder if that is not the miracle a doctor spoke of before: going out on tiptoe as discreetly as possible like an angel in the sky. Those two boys and Dexter's mother seem to give us a tremendous lesson when we are confronted to a disease that does not want to be cured. Patience, calm and receptivity seem to be the needed cure when there is no other. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Let me start out with saying I was VERY surprised with the production value of this movie. I managed to catch an early showing and I have to Say this is the BEST (if not only) Christian film to hit theaters since The Passion. Don't let the PG-13 rating scare you off, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film (divorce, teen pregnancy, drug use, and suicide), but nothing in the film is gratuitous. This is definitely a movie that a Junior High youth group could see without upsetting (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is this is not a film FOR Christians, it is a Family film without the cheesy 7th Heaven feel. The laughs are there, and several times in the theater everyone was laughing, the bits of humor were natural and didn't seem scripted or forced, and that made for good pacing in such a serious film. Teens and young adult, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film. The plot is not in any way predictable, and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit.

Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. Not only do I give this a 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, but it also is a sad, but humorous, and fun AIDS movie. And the tragic finale with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed a tear. Very well done.

    I remember watching this movie as a kid, and the most beautiful thing about movies like this is how you learn something every time watching it as you get older. This movie is not just about a cure, but a passionate and devoted friendship between an innocent sick boy named Dexter and his neighbour Eric. As the movie begins, you will see how fast kids perspectives change once they realize that their actions may hurt them for the rest of their lives. You will also realize how much symbolism is involved in the entire film. It's these kinds of movies that make us feel very insightful and want to discuss the meanings behind the symbolism. Of course, we also learn about a real truthful friendship and what it really takes to be a good person in someone's life and how people become when they realize that life can be short and we want to be remembered for all our characteristics. I have to say, this movie was exceptionally done. Every single scene I had my eyes wide open or tearing up over a heart touching scene. I was in awe at every part. If you like a good moral, clean, sad drama film with a lot of symbolism, this movie is highly recommended for you. Enjoy it because it is one of the most greatest movies, without a doubt!

    An early film on AIDS but the case considered here makes the subject extremely tender and touching. It is an 11 year old BOY who has AIDS and got it from some medical treatment. That was common at the beginning of the epidemic. Of course some neighbourhood kids accuse the child of being gay with nice words like "fag" thrown at him as if it could in anyway be possible. But the interest of the film is the relationship this sick child, Dexter, is going to build with his next door neighbour who is slightly older but alone with his mother like Dexter. This neighbour, Erik, is looking for a friend for the summer and he assumes the situation in which Dexter is naturally but with a tremendous optimism trying by all means to find a cure in some plants, concocting all kinds of potions for his friend. But the best side of the story is how these two boys develop a loving relationship that makes them adventurous, courageous, even reckless, just to get a cure for the disease or to get to New Orleans where there supposedly is some doctor who would have a cure. The whole adventure becomes some kind of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer down the Mississippi all over again, though in slightly different conditions. This love between the two boys is in fact a threesome in a way since there is always a third character, the disease itself that haunts Dexter, that possesses Dexter and at the same time that entirely controls Erik, his reactions, his care, his tricks and pranks on nurses and doctors. Erik's mother is just a prop but Dexter's mother is also extremely important in her patience, in the way she accompanies Dexter to his final destination and accepts the love between the two boys and the silly antics they do together just because it might be the last chance Dexter has to experience some pleasure, some happiness. And the end is a miracle in a way. The two boys decide to play a trick on a doctor again, Dexter pretending he is dead in order to resuscitate and frighten the doctor. But that was one time too many and this time the doctor confirms the diagnosis which is this time no longer a trick. That kind of end is so cool, so natural, so peaceful we just wonder if that is not the miracle a doctor spoke of before: going out on tiptoe as discreetly as possible like an angel in the sky. Those two boys and Dexter's mother seem to give us a tremendous lesson when we are confronted to a disease that does not want to be cured. Patience, calm and receptivity seem to be the needed cure when there is no other. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Let me start out with saying I was VERY surprised with the production value of this movie. I managed to catch an early showing and I have to Say this is the BEST (if not only) Christian film to hit theaters since The Passion. Don't let the PG-13 rating scare you off, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film (divorce, teen pregnancy, drug use, and suicide), but nothing in the film is gratuitous. This is definitely a movie that a Junior High youth group could see without upsetting (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is this is not a film FOR Christians, it is a Family film without the cheesy 7th Heaven feel. The laughs are there, and several times in the theater everyone was laughing, the bits of humor were natural and didn't seem scripted or forced, and that made for good pacing in such a serious film. Teens and young adult, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film. The plot is not in any way predictable, and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit. Christians, fortunately, are not shown as all mighty know it all's of "The Word", but instead people just trying to understand life. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot. The acting is top notch, the writing spot on, and you aren't hit over the head with all the preachy Christian rhetoric. This is a great film that will make you and your teens think, talk, and perhaps question their own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a quality family film in January check your local listings for this film, and you might learn something about yourself. And I am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie.

    "The Cure" is one of the few movies I gave a flawless score. It is one of the most deeply touching movies of all time. The story is so well-developed that we witness gradual shifts from absolute happiness to absolute sadness. In the process of this, however, it manages to attach an important message throughout the movie, which is the message of hope. The script is powerful enough to make the audience laugh and cry, and sometimes both at the same time. The acting is simply superb from two amazing boy actors, strengthening the power of this masterpiece. "The Cure" is a masterpiece that combines simplicity, funny elements, deeply touching moments, the essence of having hope and the power and meaning of friendship. It is going to leave a mark in your heart that you will carry forever. - dchgl.blogspot.com

    This film was made at a time when there wasn't a great deal of knowledge about AIDS and as a result there was a lot of misinformation and fear about the disease. This was, therefore, a courageous film, dealing with a very delicate subject matter. Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) is an 11 year old suffering from AIDS that was transmitted through a blood transfusion. Because of the disease, he's isolated and has no friends, but he does have a loving and attentive mother (Annabella Sciorra.) After moving into a new neighbourhood, Dexter suddenly has a next door neighbour named Erik (Brad Renfro.) At first, Brad wants nothing to do with Dexter, but gradually they develop a close friendship, much to the displeasure of Erik's less than attentive mother (Diana Scarwid.) The movie revolves around the attempt by the two boys to travel form their home in Minnesota to New Orleans, where they've heard that a doctor has developed a cure for AIDS. We follow their adventure and their growing friendship along the way, until Dexter becomes too ill to continue, which leads to the sad conclusion of the movie. This is a moving story, which isn't built around action or excitement but rather revolves at a leisurely and low-key pace around the friendship between Erik and Dexter. It's a solid testimony to the importance of both friendship and hope, and the impact that both have, summed up by Dexter's mother near the end of the movie. When Erik laments that they hadn't found the cure, she tells him that they did, because before Erik appeared, Dexter's life had been sad, and Erik changed that. This isn't as much of a tearjerker as I thought it might be, but it's touching. (6/10)

    People can be so mean, so selfish, so unfair, so ignorant! How would you feel if you had AIDS and were mocked, despised, bullied and treated like crap just because of the illness and even go as far as consider it a disease only for homosexuals and transmittable through the air? Do these people ever stop to rethink and think of the person they are treating as one apart? As if that wasn't enough, they go even farther by calling "faggot" to that person's neighbor. If it was like this in 1995, today it's much worse. Unlike the more popular but overrated 'Philadelphia' (with the no less overrated actor Tom Hanks), this one is not boring or dull, it's a really good movie. 'The Cure' is a movie that makes you feel good under tragic circumstances! It shows that anyone of us can bring happiness to a fragile person who is suffering from a terminal disease and treat and respect him/her well. If we really want to, we can do it. A disease is no reason to judge someone, what matters is the personality. I really think we all can learn a lot from this film. This unfortunate world and society needs more "Dexters" and "Eriks". This is the story of Dexter, a kid with a heart of gold who has AIDS (which he got from a blood transfusion). His older neighbor Erik quickly becomes his best friend, his idol, his hero and his protector. Erik idolizes him and his mother as well, as Erik has the curse of having a horrible mother. The two boys's quest to find a cure for Dexter's disease is a failure, but at least Erik managed to bring much joy for Dexter's difficult life and was the best thing that ever happened to him. The ending is sad. Dexter doesn't make it. But in real life the actor who portrayed Erik died. Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello illuminate the screen with their amazing performances. They make the movie as good as it is. It owes a lot to these two young talented artists. This should definitely be on Top 250.

    'The Cure' is a touching film about a true friendship. A friendship that exceeds all of the preconceptions. I agree that this is a tale of happiness under tragic circumstances. Plus, it portrays an ignorant side of society. Many believe that AIDS is strictly a "gay" disease and transmittable through the air and mock and treat miserably those who have it. This movie can teach us all many lessons and morals. This story is about two unlucky boys with different personalities and some problems in common (both are rejected and unwelcome by society). Erik is, I assume, 12 years old (like Brad Renfro himself back then), an easy target for a bunch of dorks and his mother is a horrible person and ignorant (and so is his unseen grandmother). Erik's neighbor Dexter is 11 (like Joseph Mazzello at the time). Dexter has a loving mother but he is a cursed child. He is very nice and sweet but he got AIDS from a blood transfusion when he was a baby and just because of his illness he is treated by the ignorants as if he was a plague. This is Dexter's drama. Poor Dexter! Erik and Dexter got off to a bad start but Erik quickly learns to like and respect Dexter and they become great friends. Together they live adventures and moments of fun and happiness at the same time they attempt to find a cure to save Dexter. Their friendship has no boundaries and both find out they're braver than they ever imagined, as their courage helps them in sticky situations. Erik gives Dexter a chance to live life as it should be lived. There is a number of heartwarming moments, such as the scene when Erik gives his tennis shoe to Dexter to comfort him and make him feel safer. Another part that gets me every time is the tense sequence when Dexter stabs his hand and says the haunting line &laquo;My blood is like poison&raquo; and gets far weaker after this bravery act and has to be taken to a hospital. During Dexter's stay at the hospital, there are some fun moments which serve as a perfect comic relief under a tragic circumstance. The boys prank the doctors that Dexter is unconscious in two occasions. Dexter scares the hell out of the doctors and laughs a lot. But in a 3rd attempt to prank them, when Erik asks Dexter &laquo;Are you ready for another victim?&raquo; and Dexter smiles and nods "Yes", the sad irony is that Dexter no longer wakes up. The cure is not found. The nice tyke doesn't make it. The two boys take the movie all by themselves and shine like stars: Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazzello as Dexter. Brad Renfro was talented and always looked mature for his age. That and the fact that his voice sounded mature for the age made him look some years older than he really was. Shame he did put himself in a bad spot few years after this movie was made and passed away early. Joseph Mazzello always proved to be a fine young actor. He is simply wonderful in this serious role. And he was a very cute kid and had the cutest and most adorable voice, along with Judith Barsi. Annabella Sciorra's acting as Linda also deserves my praise. The soundtrack is worth of my praise too, it sounds so peaceful-minded, fits perfectly in the mood of the film. This movie is a classic, deserves much better luck than it got. Title in Portugal: 'La&ccedil;os de Amizade'.

    Such an awesome movie -- I was transfixed the entire time and so emotionally overcome in the end! The two young male actors in the movie were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support of one another was quite believable and I thought the comparison/contrast between their respective home lives vs. health situations were made so very real between them. The success in bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort so to actors, EP's, producers, writers, directors, and all of production I say, "WELL PLAYED!" Having missed the credits at the beginning of the movie (it was being shown on HBO), I was so very surprised that I had to actually research (albeit briefly) the internet in order to find the title of this movie -- something so great should have been known by me -- a clear indication that this movie must be re-released!

    So glad I have HBO right now. I didn't plan on watching a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next movie on HBO was this one I decided (based on the description) to at least give it a shot. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment (I'm a little stressed out, got a huge test to be studying for), but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy. I'm currently one year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me! Anyhow, I just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed. There is definitely something for everyone in this movie!

    When the movie "The Cure" starts, we find out about a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother, and living next door to him is a young boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day, Erik and Dexter connect and head up to the supermarket, where Dexter gets his first taste of Butterfinger. When Erik learns out that Dexter has AIDS, he tries leaves-and-water tea to make it better. But when the front cover of The National Enquirer says a New Orleans doctor has found the cure for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans for the cure. In my opinion, "The Cure" is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made. It shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend, and his best friend's mom. Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. Not only do I give this a 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, but it also is a sad, but humorous, and fun AIDS movie. And the tragic finale with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed a tear. Very well done.

Erik's neighbor Dexter is 11 (like Joseph Mazzello at the time). Dexter has a loving mother but he is a cursed child. He is very nice and sweet but he got AIDS from a blood transfusion when he was a baby and just because of his illness he is treated by the ignorants as if he was a plague. This is Dexter's drama. Poor Dexter! Erik and Dexter got off to a bad start but Erik quickly learns to like and respect Dexter and they become great friends. Together they live adventures and moments of fun and happiness at the same time they attempt to find a cure to save Dexter. Their friendship has no boundaries and both find out they're braver than they ever imagined, as their courage helps them in sticky situations. Erik gives Dexter a chance to live life as it should be lived. There is a number of heartwarming moments, such as the scene when Erik gives his tennis shoe to Dexter to comfort him and make him feel safer. Another part that gets me every time is the tense sequence when Dexter stabs his hand and says the haunting line &laquo;My blood is like poison&raquo; and gets far weaker after this bravery act and has to be taken to a hospital. During Dexter's stay at the hospital, there are some fun moments which serve as a perfect comic relief under a tragic circumstance. The boys prank the doctors that Dexter is unconscious in two occasions. Dexter scares the hell out of the doctors and laughs a lot. But in a 3rd attempt to prank them, when Erik asks Dexter &laquo;Are you ready for another victim?&raquo; and Dexter smiles and nods "Yes", the sad irony is that Dexter no longer wakes up. The cure is not found. The nice tyke doesn't make it. The two boys take the movie all by themselves and shine like stars: Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazzello as Dexter. Brad Renfro was talented and always looked mature for his age. That and the fact that his voice sounded mature for the age made him look some years older than he really was. Shame he did put himself in a bad spot few years after this movie was made and passed away early. Joseph Mazzello always proved to be a fine young actor. He is simply wonderful in this serious role. And he was a very cute kid and had the cutest and most adorable voice, along with Judith Barsi. Annabella Sciorra's acting as Linda also deserves my praise. The soundtrack is worth of my praise too, it sounds so peaceful-minded, fits perfectly in the mood of the film. This movie is a classic, deserves much better luck than it got. Title in Portugal: 'La&ccedil;os de Amizade'.

    Such an awesome movie -- I was transfixed the entire time and so emotionally overcome in the end! The two young male actors in the movie were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support of one another was quite believable and I thought the comparison/contrast between their respective home lives vs. health situations were made so very real between them. The success in bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort so to actors, EP's, producers, writers, directors, and all of production I say, "WELL PLAYED!" Having missed the credits at the beginning of the movie (it was being shown on HBO), I was so very surprised that I had to actually research (albeit briefly) the internet in order to find the title of this movie -- something so great should have been known by me -- a clear indication that this movie must be re-released!

    So glad I have HBO right now. I didn't plan on watching a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next movie on HBO was this one I decided (based on the description) to at least give it a shot. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment (I'm a little stressed out, got a huge test to be studying for), but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy. I'm currently one year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me! Anyhow, I just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed. There is definitely something for everyone in this movie!

    When the movie "The Cure" starts, we find out about a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother, and living next door to him is a young boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day, Erik and Dexter connect and head up to the supermarket, where Dexter gets his first taste of Butterfinger. When Erik learns out that Dexter has AIDS, he tries leaves-and-water tea to make it better. But when the front cover of The National Enquirer says a New Orleans doctor has found the cure for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans for the cure. In my opinion, "The Cure" is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made. It shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend, and his best friend's mom. Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. Not only do I give this a 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, but it also is a sad, but humorous, and fun AIDS movie. And the tragic finale with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed a tear. Very well done.
