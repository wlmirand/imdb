 <sinopse>
  Oilman Jan is paralyzed in an accident. His wife, who prayed for his return, feels guilty; even more, when Jan urges her to have sex with another.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Drama set in a repressed, deeply religious community in the north of Scotland, where a naive young woman named Bess McNeil meets and falls in love with Danish oil-rig worker Jan. Bess and Jan are deeply in love but, when Jan returns to his rig, Bess prays to God that he returns for good. Jan does return, his neck broken in an accident aboard the rig. Because of his condition, Jan and Bess are now unable to enjoy a sexual relationship and Jan urges Bess to take another lover and tell him the details. As Bess becomes more and more deviant in her sexual behavior, the more she comes to believe that her actions are guided by God and are helping Jan recover.

    Emily seems to have no choices in her depiction. She is unyielding in her devotion and we truly have no idea why. Yet that is who we are supposed to believe she is. A woman without any input from her surroundings. A woman incapable of perceiving her environment. Perhaps that's just her. That's why my vote is 4 instead of 1. It's a pretty film and a provocative one, yet it is without much value in the real world. Van Trier again demands we exist within his unreal depiction for an hour or two while we sit through the display of our protagonist, unrealistic yet strongly portrayed. Perhaps in this nether world women can be blind and sub-human. She continues on and on without hope. She builds minute after minute into a creature more and more inhuman -- devoted to the unyielding, dried and coarse veins of perfunctory action, rather than traits befitting a human. Finally she dies and we are relieved. Then her husband is renewed and the inhuman circumstances are revealed and portrayed like some after-school special. Dull. Boring. Sad that we had to watch it.

    "Breaking the Waves" is a 1996 romantic drama directed by Lars Von Trier. Bess (Emily Watson) is a strong believer in god, she goes to church frequently and has long talks with him and answers herself as an angry god through her own voice. She marries a nice man named Jan (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd) and they express a great sexual desire for each other, but he soon is paralyzed in an accident. Bess prays for him to return, but then Jan convinces her that the only way he will walk again is if she finds another man to have sex with. It made me realize what a great director Lars Von Trier is, he knows how to make characters feel painfully realistic, which makes his movies a lot more dramatic than others. The movie is equally uplifting and depressing, it deals with themes of faith and religion. Emily Watson's character is like a Disney princess stuck in the real world, struggling to find the bright side of life. I loved the opening to the film, when Bess (Emily Watson) looks at the camera, its like she's asking us to judge her. Apart from that, the rock music was great, it gave me a relaxing feeling that "Dancer in the Dark" didn't, a moment to breath in the middle of all the chaos going on. The dialog between Bess (Emily Watson) and god reminded me of Gollum talking to his other personality in "The Lord of the Rings", I wonder if this film influenced them somehow. I'd recommend it to people who enjoyed movies like "Take Shelter", "Dancer in the Dark", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Closer", or "The Marriage of Maria Braun".

    I love love LOVE Lars Von Trier films. This is a bit of a sleeper in his canon though, as there are films I like better (Antichrist, Dancer In The Dark, and the AMAZING Zentropa) but even then, this film is brilliant. All about a bit of a messed up in the head woman who marries a oil rigger. When he is critically injured, one of his requests is to have her take men on, and tell him about it to make him better. When he gets worse, she feels she's not doing enough. Even though this film is stark and ugly at times, there is some amazing points of beauty. I really did love the chapter intertitles, with it's scenery and music, so amazing. Emily Watson, my god, just blows me away, and that ending, for some dumb reason (I've seen this about 4 times now) made me weep in how beautiful it was.

    I don't know why people see this as a great love story. There is nothing loving or beautiful about how Jan forces his wife (who is clearly not quite "all there") to succumb to his perverse fantasies to gain some power back after he's paralyzed. Classic domestic violence if I ever saw it. Just because he's not hitting her doesn't mean he's not abusing her in the worst possible way. It's also pretty sickening to watch just how ugly religion can get and how fundamentalist christians (most religions, not just christians) could treat an innocent like Bess. A person who is good all the way but also who is probably with an IQ in the lower ranges. Organized religion really IS the root of all evil in this world because humans are the way they are. A male dominated, fundamentalist religious world where violence (sexual and emotional) is the main focus is portrayed very well in this raw movie. Stellan is awesome as always. Very good movie and definitely recommended. I just don't get why all the reviews are about this being a love story, but that's just me.

    Whether one cares for this film or not, Emily Watson gives a performance that will overwhelm audiences for many generations to come. Her interpretation of the character of Bess is beyond anything ever before put on celluloid. That she was not awarded an Academy Award the year she stunned audiences in this film has resulted in Oscars being considered meaningless to anyone appreciative of great acting. In fact, Ms. Watson continues to give deeply of her soul in every subsequent role she has assayed and elevated each film and fellow actors with her work. Her simple beauty and magnificent heart gave life to turgid melodramas such as Angela's Ashes, brilliance to Adam Sandler's vehicle Punch-Drunk love, and set the screen on fire with a never before seen motion picture passion in Hillary and Jackie. A moving children's' piece such as the Water Horse was given depth and realism due to her incredible portrait of the mother and widow whose sexuality roils just beneath the surface of her grief. No other actor, male or female, has left audience members so breathless, so incapacitated, and so staggered by every single performance. Emily Watson is not simply the most gifted actor to ever step before a camera, she is a precious gift to cinema, a jewel beyond price, and the single most important actor of all time. Her work in Breaking the Waves set a bar that few actors could reach again, yet she exceeds that height of authentic greatness time after time. It would not be an overstatement to say that cinema was created as a medium so that Emily Watson's genius as an actor, her unique beauty as a woman, and her authentic expression of life itself could be shared with all humanity across the ages, for all time.

    Featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this was the first English language film from Danish director Lars Von Trier (The Idiots, Dogville), and I was looking forward to watching it for that, and the two then less known leading stars. Basically in a community in the north of Scotland that is repressed and deeply religious lives the young and naive Bess McNeill (introducing Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emily Watson), who has a strong belief in God, to the point where she often talks to herself answering as the voice of the lord, and she has other childlike qualities and some psychological problems. Despite this she is happily married to oil Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), and they enjoy each other's company in the time they have together, but she finds it very difficult to be without him while he works on the platform, only making occasional phone calls discussing their love and sexual desires, including her talking about his prick. Bess prays for Jan to return immediately home, but tragedy strikes he is caught in an industrial accident and he ends up paralysed, and he is flown back to mainland to hospital, and feeling strong grief and distress Bess believes that her prayers are what caused the accident to occur. Jan is really badly affected by the tragedy because he knows his paralysis means it will be pretty much impossible to ever be able to perform sexually with his wife, and knowing the affect it will have on Bess as well he asks her to find a new lover, and shocked she storms out on him, and meanwhile Jan attempts and fails a suicide and unconscious stays in hospital. Slowly his condition deteriorates and he keeps urging his wife to find other men and have sex with them, and tell him everything that happened, all details, so it will seem like they were together and are keeping their love and passion alive, and eventually she tries in small ways to do this, for example, masturbating a man on the bus. Bess comes to believe that what she is doing, when she gives into his idea, are in accordance with her love for Jan, and the will of God, who she eventually starts talking to and using her own voice with again, and despite her guilt and agitation being with other men she does believe she is keeping her husband alive. In the end, after spending so much time branded by those who she knows as a tart or a prostitute, Bess is put into a mental institution, which she escapes from, and a trip to the docks get her sent to hospital where she needs an operation, but it is unsuccessful and Bess dies, while Jan lives on in his wheelchair and she is married at sea. Also starring Katrin Cartlidge as Dodo McNeill, Jean-Marc Barr as Terry, Udo Kier as Sadistic Sailor / Man on the trawler, Adrian Rawlins as Dr. Richardson, Jonathan Hackett as Priest and Sandra Voe as Mother. Watson gives an extraordinary performance as the innocent woman struck by tragedy and forcing herself into sacrifice for her true love, and in his moments Skarsg&aring;rd is likable before his accident and then gives a suitably sympathetic performance, the story is very profound as it exposes how faith and passion can influence decisions, it is very moving and sometimes depressing, but a most watchable drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Very good!

    Definitely not what I was expecting. However, in a very good way. The strong U-turn in the energy of the film is very unsettling since it uses the obvious "destroy something beautiful" plot to evoke emotion in the audience, and so yes it is predictably tragic. A struggle to get through, and I doubt I could face it again, but I don't think I'll ever forget this. It's one of those films which is entirely essential to fans of Von Trier's style, but those who have been unimpressed in the past by him or do not find his style absorbing probably won't find much here. I think the entire film is worth it solely for the ending, which I had been expecting to fizzle and fade out, and just as it had actually done so, the last few scenes arrive with something melancholy yet very special.

    This was the last recommendation made to me by someone really special, and I'm thankful with her for recommending me such a beautiful film. This movie portrays in a tragic, painful yet pure way how love is the most powerful of all gifts given to men. If you truly love someone you will be willing to do anything for that person, and in this film you can clearly see this. Another subject talked about in it is faith. How there's a lot of people who don't have faith in a spiritual way, and how they see those who have it as if they where crazy, but what those people ignore is that faith can be something very powerful, even if it's actually not true. "Love... bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails".

    Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), who has psychological problems, marries Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), despite the apprehensions of her community and Calvinist church. Bess is somewhat simple and childlike, and has difficulty living without Jan when he is away on the oil platform, where he is scheduled to work for ten days. She prays for his immediate return, and when he returns the next day paralyzed by an industrial accident, she believes it is her fault. No longer able to perform sexually, and mentally affected by the accident, Jan urges her to find and have sex with other men and then tell him the details. This film also has Udo Kier as the Sadistic Sailor. And Helena Bonham Carter was von Trier's first choice to play the role of Bess, but she dropped out just before shooting was to start, reportedly due to the large amount of nudity and sexuality required by the role. This is a great loss. Breaking the Waves was named one of the ten best films of the decade by both Roger Ebert and Martin Scorsese during a show where the famous film personalities listed their top movies of the 1990s. For me, the thing about this movie is not any lesson we might learn, it is the very definition of love. If one partner is in a coma or incapacitated, does this make it okay for the other partner to pursue physical love elsewhere? What is the other partner fully encourages it? I think this film explores the ins and outs of that very well, including the repulsion Bess feels when trying to touch another man.

If you truly love someone you will be willing to do anything for that person, and in this film you can clearly see this. Another subject talked about in it is faith. How there's a lot of people who don't have faith in a spiritual way, and how they see those who have it as if they where crazy, but what those people ignore is that faith can be something very powerful, even if it's actually not true. "Love... bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails".

    Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), who has psychological problems, marries Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), despite the apprehensions of her community and Calvinist church. Bess is somewhat simple and childlike, and has difficulty living without Jan when he is away on the oil platform, where he is scheduled to work for ten days. She prays for his immediate return, and when he returns the next day paralyzed by an industrial accident, she believes it is her fault. No longer able to perform sexually, and mentally affected by the accident, Jan urges her to find and have sex with other men and then tell him the details. This film also has Udo Kier as the Sadistic Sailor. And Helena Bonham Carter was von Trier's first choice to play the role of Bess, but she dropped out just before shooting was to start, reportedly due to the large amount of nudity and sexuality required by the role. This is a great loss. Breaking the Waves was named one of the ten best films of the decade by both Roger Ebert and Martin Scorsese during a show where the famous film personalities listed their top movies of the 1990s. For me, the thing about this movie is not any lesson we might learn, it is the very definition of love. If one partner is in a coma or incapacitated, does this make it okay for the other partner to pursue physical love elsewhere? What is the other partner fully encourages it? I think this film explores the ins and outs of that very well, including the repulsion Bess feels when trying to touch another man.

    Emily seems to have no choices in her depiction. She is unyielding in her devotion and we truly have no idea why. Yet that is who we are supposed to believe she is. A woman without any input from her surroundings. A woman incapable of perceiving her environment. Perhaps that's just her. That's why my vote is 4 instead of 1. It's a pretty film and a provocative one, yet it is without much value in the real world. Van Trier again demands we exist within his unreal depiction for an hour or two while we sit through the display of our protagonist, unrealistic yet strongly portrayed. Perhaps in this nether world women can be blind and sub-human. She continues on and on without hope. She builds minute after minute into a creature more and more inhuman -- devoted to the unyielding, dried and coarse veins of perfunctory action, rather than traits befitting a human. Finally she dies and we are relieved. Then her husband is renewed and the inhuman circumstances are revealed and portrayed like some after-school special. Dull. Boring. Sad that we had to watch it.

    "Breaking the Waves" is a 1996 romantic drama directed by Lars Von Trier. Bess (Emily Watson) is a strong believer in god, she goes to church frequently and has long talks with him and answers herself as an angry god through her own voice. She marries a nice man named Jan (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd) and they express a great sexual desire for each other, but he soon is paralyzed in an accident. Bess prays for him to return, but then Jan convinces her that the only way he will walk again is if she finds another man to have sex with. It made me realize what a great director Lars Von Trier is, he knows how to make characters feel painfully realistic, which makes his movies a lot more dramatic than others. The movie is equally uplifting and depressing, it deals with themes of faith and religion. Emily Watson's character is like a Disney princess stuck in the real world, struggling to find the bright side of life. I loved the opening to the film, when Bess (Emily Watson) looks at the camera, its like she's asking us to judge her. Apart from that, the rock music was great, it gave me a relaxing feeling that "Dancer in the Dark" didn't, a moment to breath in the middle of all the chaos going on. The dialog between Bess (Emily Watson) and god reminded me of Gollum talking to his other personality in "The Lord of the Rings", I wonder if this film influenced them somehow. I'd recommend it to people who enjoyed movies like "Take Shelter", "Dancer in the Dark", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Closer", or "The Marriage of Maria Braun".

    I love love LOVE Lars Von Trier films. This is a bit of a sleeper in his canon though, as there are films I like better (Antichrist, Dancer In The Dark, and the AMAZING Zentropa) but even then, this film is brilliant. All about a bit of a messed up in the head woman who marries a oil rigger. When he is critically injured, one of his requests is to have her take men on, and tell him about it to make him better. When he gets worse, she feels she's not doing enough. Even though this film is stark and ugly at times, there is some amazing points of beauty. I really did love the chapter intertitles, with it's scenery and music, so amazing. Emily Watson, my god, just blows me away, and that ending, for some dumb reason (I've seen this about 4 times now) made me weep in how beautiful it was.

    I don't know why people see this as a great love story. There is nothing loving or beautiful about how Jan forces his wife (who is clearly not quite "all there") to succumb to his perverse fantasies to gain some power back after he's paralyzed. Classic domestic violence if I ever saw it. Just because he's not hitting her doesn't mean he's not abusing her in the worst possible way. It's also pretty sickening to watch just how ugly religion can get and how fundamentalist christians (most religions, not just christians) could treat an innocent like Bess. A person who is good all the way but also who is probably with an IQ in the lower ranges. Organized religion really IS the root of all evil in this world because humans are the way they are. A male dominated, fundamentalist religious world where violence (sexual and emotional) is the main focus is portrayed very well in this raw movie. Stellan is awesome as always. Very good movie and definitely recommended. I just don't get why all the reviews are about this being a love story, but that's just me.

    Whether one cares for this film or not, Emily Watson gives a performance that will overwhelm audiences for many generations to come. Her interpretation of the character of Bess is beyond anything ever before put on celluloid. That she was not awarded an Academy Award the year she stunned audiences in this film has resulted in Oscars being considered meaningless to anyone appreciative of great acting. In fact, Ms. Watson continues to give deeply of her soul in every subsequent role she has assayed and elevated each film and fellow actors with her work. Her simple beauty and magnificent heart gave life to turgid melodramas such as Angela's Ashes, brilliance to Adam Sandler's vehicle Punch-Drunk love, and set the screen on fire with a never before seen motion picture passion in Hillary and Jackie. A moving children's' piece such as the Water Horse was given depth and realism due to her incredible portrait of the mother and widow whose sexuality roils just beneath the surface of her grief. No other actor, male or female, has left audience members so breathless, so incapacitated, and so staggered by every single performance. Emily Watson is not simply the most gifted actor to ever step before a camera, she is a precious gift to cinema, a jewel beyond price, and the single most important actor of all time. Her work in Breaking the Waves set a bar that few actors could reach again, yet she exceeds that height of authentic greatness time after time. It would not be an overstatement to say that cinema was created as a medium so that Emily Watson's genius as an actor, her unique beauty as a woman, and her authentic expression of life itself could be shared with all humanity across the ages, for all time.

    Featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this was the first English language film from Danish director Lars Von Trier (The Idiots, Dogville), and I was looking forward to watching it for that, and the two then less known leading stars. Basically in a community in the north of Scotland that is repressed and deeply religious lives the young and naive Bess McNeill (introducing Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emily Watson), who has a strong belief in God, to the point where she often talks to herself answering as the voice of the lord, and she has other childlike qualities and some psychological problems. Despite this she is happily married to oil Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), and they enjoy each other's company in the time they have together, but she finds it very difficult to be without him while he works on the platform, only making occasional phone calls discussing their love and sexual desires, including her talking about his prick. Bess prays for Jan to return immediately home, but tragedy strikes he is caught in an industrial accident and he ends up paralysed, and he is flown back to mainland to hospital, and feeling strong grief and distress Bess believes that her prayers are what caused the accident to occur. Jan is really badly affected by the tragedy because he knows his paralysis means it will be pretty much impossible to ever be able to perform sexually with his wife, and knowing the affect it will have on Bess as well he asks her to find a new lover, and shocked she storms out on him, and meanwhile Jan attempts and fails a suicide and unconscious stays in hospital. Slowly his condition deteriorates and he keeps urging his wife to find other men and have sex with them, and tell him everything that happened, all details, so it will seem like they were together and are keeping their love and passion alive, and eventually she tries in small ways to do this, for example, masturbating a man on the bus. Bess comes to believe that what she is doing, when she gives into his idea, are in accordance with her love for Jan, and the will of God, who she eventually starts talking to and using her own voice with again, and despite her guilt and agitation being with other men she does believe she is keeping her husband alive. In the end, after spending so much time branded by those who she knows as a tart or a prostitute, Bess is put into a mental institution, which she escapes from, and a trip to the docks get her sent to hospital where she needs an operation, but it is unsuccessful and Bess dies, while Jan lives on in his wheelchair and she is married at sea. Also starring Katrin Cartlidge as Dodo McNeill, Jean-Marc Barr as Terry, Udo Kier as Sadistic Sailor / Man on the trawler, Adrian Rawlins as Dr. Richardson, Jonathan Hackett as Priest and Sandra Voe as Mother. Watson gives an extraordinary performance as the innocent woman struck by tragedy and forcing herself into sacrifice for her true love, and in his moments Skarsg&aring;rd is likable before his accident and then gives a suitably sympathetic performance, the story is very profound as it exposes how faith and passion can influence decisions, it is very moving and sometimes depressing, but a most watchable drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Very good!

    Definitely not what I was expecting. However, in a very good way. The strong U-turn in the energy of the film is very unsettling since it uses the obvious "destroy something beautiful" plot to evoke emotion in the audience, and so yes it is predictably tragic. A struggle to get through, and I doubt I could face it again, but I don't think I'll ever forget this. It's one of those films which is entirely essential to fans of Von Trier's style, but those who have been unimpressed in the past by him or do not find his style absorbing probably won't find much here. I think the entire film is worth it solely for the ending, which I had been expecting to fizzle and fade out, and just as it had actually done so, the last few scenes arrive with something melancholy yet very special.

If you truly love someone you will be willing to do anything for that person, and in this film you can clearly see this. Another subject talked about in it is faith. How there's a lot of people who don't have faith in a spiritual way, and how they see those who have it as if they where crazy, but what those people ignore is that faith can be something very powerful, even if it's actually not true. "Love... bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails".

    Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), who has psychological problems, marries Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), despite the apprehensions of her community and Calvinist church. Bess is somewhat simple and childlike, and has difficulty living without Jan when he is away on the oil platform, where he is scheduled to work for ten days. She prays for his immediate return, and when he returns the next day paralyzed by an industrial accident, she believes it is her fault. No longer able to perform sexually, and mentally affected by the accident, Jan urges her to find and have sex with other men and then tell him the details. This film also has Udo Kier as the Sadistic Sailor. And Helena Bonham Carter was von Trier's first choice to play the role of Bess, but she dropped out just before shooting was to start, reportedly due to the large amount of nudity and sexuality required by the role. This is a great loss. Breaking the Waves was named one of the ten best films of the decade by both Roger Ebert and Martin Scorsese during a show where the famous film personalities listed their top movies of the 1990s. For me, the thing about this movie is not any lesson we might learn, it is the very definition of love. If one partner is in a coma or incapacitated, does this make it okay for the other partner to pursue physical love elsewhere? What is the other partner fully encourages it? I think this film explores the ins and outs of that very well, including the repulsion Bess feels when trying to touch another man.

    Emily seems to have no choices in her depiction. She is unyielding in her devotion and we truly have no idea why. Yet that is who we are supposed to believe she is. A woman without any input from her surroundings. A woman incapable of perceiving her environment. Perhaps that's just her. That's why my vote is 4 instead of 1. It's a pretty film and a provocative one, yet it is without much value in the real world. Van Trier again demands we exist within his unreal depiction for an hour or two while we sit through the display of our protagonist, unrealistic yet strongly portrayed. Perhaps in this nether world women can be blind and sub-human. She continues on and on without hope. She builds minute after minute into a creature more and more inhuman -- devoted to the unyielding, dried and coarse veins of perfunctory action, rather than traits befitting a human. Finally she dies and we are relieved. Then her husband is renewed and the inhuman circumstances are revealed and portrayed like some after-school special. Dull. Boring. Sad that we had to watch it.

    "Breaking the Waves" is a 1996 romantic drama directed by Lars Von Trier. Bess (Emily Watson) is a strong believer in god, she goes to church frequently and has long talks with him and answers herself as an angry god through her own voice. She marries a nice man named Jan (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd) and they express a great sexual desire for each other, but he soon is paralyzed in an accident. Bess prays for him to return, but then Jan convinces her that the only way he will walk again is if she finds another man to have sex with. It made me realize what a great director Lars Von Trier is, he knows how to make characters feel painfully realistic, which makes his movies a lot more dramatic than others. The movie is equally uplifting and depressing, it deals with themes of faith and religion. Emily Watson's character is like a Disney princess stuck in the real world, struggling to find the bright side of life. I loved the opening to the film, when Bess (Emily Watson) looks at the camera, its like she's asking us to judge her. Apart from that, the rock music was great, it gave me a relaxing feeling that "Dancer in the Dark" didn't, a moment to breath in the middle of all the chaos going on. The dialog between Bess (Emily Watson) and god reminded me of Gollum talking to his other personality in "The Lord of the Rings", I wonder if this film influenced them somehow. I'd recommend it to people who enjoyed movies like "Take Shelter", "Dancer in the Dark", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Closer", or "The Marriage of Maria Braun".

    I love love LOVE Lars Von Trier films. This is a bit of a sleeper in his canon though, as there are films I like better (Antichrist, Dancer In The Dark, and the AMAZING Zentropa) but even then, this film is brilliant. All about a bit of a messed up in the head woman who marries a oil rigger. When he is critically injured, one of his requests is to have her take men on, and tell him about it to make him better. When he gets worse, she feels she's not doing enough. Even though this film is stark and ugly at times, there is some amazing points of beauty. I really did love the chapter intertitles, with it's scenery and music, so amazing. Emily Watson, my god, just blows me away, and that ending, for some dumb reason (I've seen this about 4 times now) made me weep in how beautiful it was.

    I don't know why people see this as a great love story. There is nothing loving or beautiful about how Jan forces his wife (who is clearly not quite "all there") to succumb to his perverse fantasies to gain some power back after he's paralyzed. Classic domestic violence if I ever saw it. Just because he's not hitting her doesn't mean he's not abusing her in the worst possible way. It's also pretty sickening to watch just how ugly religion can get and how fundamentalist christians (most religions, not just christians) could treat an innocent like Bess. A person who is good all the way but also who is probably with an IQ in the lower ranges. Organized religion really IS the root of all evil in this world because humans are the way they are. A male dominated, fundamentalist religious world where violence (sexual and emotional) is the main focus is portrayed very well in this raw movie. Stellan is awesome as always. Very good movie and definitely recommended. I just don't get why all the reviews are about this being a love story, but that's just me.

    Whether one cares for this film or not, Emily Watson gives a performance that will overwhelm audiences for many generations to come. Her interpretation of the character of Bess is beyond anything ever before put on celluloid. That she was not awarded an Academy Award the year she stunned audiences in this film has resulted in Oscars being considered meaningless to anyone appreciative of great acting. In fact, Ms. Watson continues to give deeply of her soul in every subsequent role she has assayed and elevated each film and fellow actors with her work. Her simple beauty and magnificent heart gave life to turgid melodramas such as Angela's Ashes, brilliance to Adam Sandler's vehicle Punch-Drunk love, and set the screen on fire with a never before seen motion picture passion in Hillary and Jackie. A moving children's' piece such as the Water Horse was given depth and realism due to her incredible portrait of the mother and widow whose sexuality roils just beneath the surface of her grief. No other actor, male or female, has left audience members so breathless, so incapacitated, and so staggered by every single performance. Emily Watson is not simply the most gifted actor to ever step before a camera, she is a precious gift to cinema, a jewel beyond price, and the single most important actor of all time. Her work in Breaking the Waves set a bar that few actors could reach again, yet she exceeds that height of authentic greatness time after time. It would not be an overstatement to say that cinema was created as a medium so that Emily Watson's genius as an actor, her unique beauty as a woman, and her authentic expression of life itself could be shared with all humanity across the ages, for all time.

    Featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this was the first English language film from Danish director Lars Von Trier (The Idiots, Dogville), and I was looking forward to watching it for that, and the two then less known leading stars. Basically in a community in the north of Scotland that is repressed and deeply religious lives the young and naive Bess McNeill (introducing Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emily Watson), who has a strong belief in God, to the point where she often talks to herself answering as the voice of the lord, and she has other childlike qualities and some psychological problems. Despite this she is happily married to oil Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), and they enjoy each other's company in the time they have together, but she finds it very difficult to be without him while he works on the platform, only making occasional phone calls discussing their love and sexual desires, including her talking about his prick. Bess prays for Jan to return immediately home, but tragedy strikes he is caught in an industrial accident and he ends up paralysed, and he is flown back to mainland to hospital, and feeling strong grief and distress Bess believes that her prayers are what caused the accident to occur. Jan is really badly affected by the tragedy because he knows his paralysis means it will be pretty much impossible to ever be able to perform sexually with his wife, and knowing the affect it will have on Bess as well he asks her to find a new lover, and shocked she storms out on him, and meanwhile Jan attempts and fails a suicide and unconscious stays in hospital. Slowly his condition deteriorates and he keeps urging his wife to find other men and have sex with them, and tell him everything that happened, all details, so it will seem like they were together and are keeping their love and passion alive, and eventually she tries in small ways to do this, for example, masturbating a man on the bus. Bess comes to believe that what she is doing, when she gives into his idea, are in accordance with her love for Jan, and the will of God, who she eventually starts talking to and using her own voice with again, and despite her guilt and agitation being with other men she does believe she is keeping her husband alive. In the end, after spending so much time branded by those who she knows as a tart or a prostitute, Bess is put into a mental institution, which she escapes from, and a trip to the docks get her sent to hospital where she needs an operation, but it is unsuccessful and Bess dies, while Jan lives on in his wheelchair and she is married at sea. Also starring Katrin Cartlidge as Dodo McNeill, Jean-Marc Barr as Terry, Udo Kier as Sadistic Sailor / Man on the trawler, Adrian Rawlins as Dr. Richardson, Jonathan Hackett as Priest and Sandra Voe as Mother. Watson gives an extraordinary performance as the innocent woman struck by tragedy and forcing herself into sacrifice for her true love, and in his moments Skarsg&aring;rd is likable before his accident and then gives a suitably sympathetic performance, the story is very profound as it exposes how faith and passion can influence decisions, it is very moving and sometimes depressing, but a most watchable drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Very good!

    Definitely not what I was expecting. However, in a very good way. The strong U-turn in the energy of the film is very unsettling since it uses the obvious "destroy something beautiful" plot to evoke emotion in the audience, and so yes it is predictably tragic. A struggle to get through, and I doubt I could face it again, but I don't think I'll ever forget this. It's one of those films which is entirely essential to fans of Von Trier's style, but those who have been unimpressed in the past by him or do not find his style absorbing probably won't find much here. I think the entire film is worth it solely for the ending, which I had been expecting to fizzle and fade out, and just as it had actually done so, the last few scenes arrive with something melancholy yet very special.

If you truly love someone you will be willing to do anything for that person, and in this film you can clearly see this. Another subject talked about in it is faith. How there's a lot of people who don't have faith in a spiritual way, and how they see those who have it as if they where crazy, but what those people ignore is that faith can be something very powerful, even if it's actually not true. "Love... bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails".

    Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), who has psychological problems, marries Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), despite the apprehensions of her community and Calvinist church. Bess is somewhat simple and childlike, and has difficulty living without Jan when he is away on the oil platform, where he is scheduled to work for ten days. She prays for his immediate return, and when he returns the next day paralyzed by an industrial accident, she believes it is her fault. No longer able to perform sexually, and mentally affected by the accident, Jan urges her to find and have sex with other men and then tell him the details. This film also has Udo Kier as the Sadistic Sailor. And Helena Bonham Carter was von Trier's first choice to play the role of Bess, but she dropped out just before shooting was to start, reportedly due to the large amount of nudity and sexuality required by the role. This is a great loss. Breaking the Waves was named one of the ten best films of the decade by both Roger Ebert and Martin Scorsese during a show where the famous film personalities listed their top movies of the 1990s. For me, the thing about this movie is not any lesson we might learn, it is the very definition of love. If one partner is in a coma or incapacitated, does this make it okay for the other partner to pursue physical love elsewhere? What is the other partner fully encourages it? I think this film explores the ins and outs of that very well, including the repulsion Bess feels when trying to touch another man.

    Emily seems to have no choices in her depiction. She is unyielding in her devotion and we truly have no idea why. Yet that is who we are supposed to believe she is. A woman without any input from her surroundings. A woman incapable of perceiving her environment. Perhaps that's just her. That's why my vote is 4 instead of 1. It's a pretty film and a provocative one, yet it is without much value in the real world. Van Trier again demands we exist within his unreal depiction for an hour or two while we sit through the display of our protagonist, unrealistic yet strongly portrayed. Perhaps in this nether world women can be blind and sub-human. She continues on and on without hope. She builds minute after minute into a creature more and more inhuman -- devoted to the unyielding, dried and coarse veins of perfunctory action, rather than traits befitting a human. Finally she dies and we are relieved. Then her husband is renewed and the inhuman circumstances are revealed and portrayed like some after-school special. Dull. Boring. Sad that we had to watch it.

    "Breaking the Waves" is a 1996 romantic drama directed by Lars Von Trier. Bess (Emily Watson) is a strong believer in god, she goes to church frequently and has long talks with him and answers herself as an angry god through her own voice. She marries a nice man named Jan (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd) and they express a great sexual desire for each other, but he soon is paralyzed in an accident. Bess prays for him to return, but then Jan convinces her that the only way he will walk again is if she finds another man to have sex with. It made me realize what a great director Lars Von Trier is, he knows how to make characters feel painfully realistic, which makes his movies a lot more dramatic than others. The movie is equally uplifting and depressing, it deals with themes of faith and religion. Emily Watson's character is like a Disney princess stuck in the real world, struggling to find the bright side of life. I loved the opening to the film, when Bess (Emily Watson) looks at the camera, its like she's asking us to judge her. Apart from that, the rock music was great, it gave me a relaxing feeling that "Dancer in the Dark" didn't, a moment to breath in the middle of all the chaos going on. The dialog between Bess (Emily Watson) and god reminded me of Gollum talking to his other personality in "The Lord of the Rings", I wonder if this film influenced them somehow. I'd recommend it to people who enjoyed movies like "Take Shelter", "Dancer in the Dark", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Closer", or "The Marriage of Maria Braun".

    I love love LOVE Lars Von Trier films. This is a bit of a sleeper in his canon though, as there are films I like better (Antichrist, Dancer In The Dark, and the AMAZING Zentropa) but even then, this film is brilliant. All about a bit of a messed up in the head woman who marries a oil rigger. When he is critically injured, one of his requests is to have her take men on, and tell him about it to make him better. When he gets worse, she feels she's not doing enough. Even though this film is stark and ugly at times, there is some amazing points of beauty. I really did love the chapter intertitles, with it's scenery and music, so amazing. Emily Watson, my god, just blows me away, and that ending, for some dumb reason (I've seen this about 4 times now) made me weep in how beautiful it was.

    I don't know why people see this as a great love story. There is nothing loving or beautiful about how Jan forces his wife (who is clearly not quite "all there") to succumb to his perverse fantasies to gain some power back after he's paralyzed. Classic domestic violence if I ever saw it. Just because he's not hitting her doesn't mean he's not abusing her in the worst possible way. It's also pretty sickening to watch just how ugly religion can get and how fundamentalist christians (most religions, not just christians) could treat an innocent like Bess. A person who is good all the way but also who is probably with an IQ in the lower ranges. Organized religion really IS the root of all evil in this world because humans are the way they are. A male dominated, fundamentalist religious world where violence (sexual and emotional) is the main focus is portrayed very well in this raw movie. Stellan is awesome as always. Very good movie and definitely recommended. I just don't get why all the reviews are about this being a love story, but that's just me.

    Whether one cares for this film or not, Emily Watson gives a performance that will overwhelm audiences for many generations to come. Her interpretation of the character of Bess is beyond anything ever before put on celluloid. That she was not awarded an Academy Award the year she stunned audiences in this film has resulted in Oscars being considered meaningless to anyone appreciative of great acting. In fact, Ms. Watson continues to give deeply of her soul in every subsequent role she has assayed and elevated each film and fellow actors with her work. Her simple beauty and magnificent heart gave life to turgid melodramas such as Angela's Ashes, brilliance to Adam Sandler's vehicle Punch-Drunk love, and set the screen on fire with a never before seen motion picture passion in Hillary and Jackie. A moving children's' piece such as the Water Horse was given depth and realism due to her incredible portrait of the mother and widow whose sexuality roils just beneath the surface of her grief. No other actor, male or female, has left audience members so breathless, so incapacitated, and so staggered by every single performance. Emily Watson is not simply the most gifted actor to ever step before a camera, she is a precious gift to cinema, a jewel beyond price, and the single most important actor of all time. Her work in Breaking the Waves set a bar that few actors could reach again, yet she exceeds that height of authentic greatness time after time. It would not be an overstatement to say that cinema was created as a medium so that Emily Watson's genius as an actor, her unique beauty as a woman, and her authentic expression of life itself could be shared with all humanity across the ages, for all time.

    Featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this was the first English language film from Danish director Lars Von Trier (The Idiots, Dogville), and I was looking forward to watching it for that, and the two then less known leading stars. Basically in a community in the north of Scotland that is repressed and deeply religious lives the young and naive Bess McNeill (introducing Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emily Watson), who has a strong belief in God, to the point where she often talks to herself answering as the voice of the lord, and she has other childlike qualities and some psychological problems. Despite this she is happily married to oil Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), and they enjoy each other's company in the time they have together, but she finds it very difficult to be without him while he works on the platform, only making occasional phone calls discussing their love and sexual desires, including her talking about his prick. Bess prays for Jan to return immediately home, but tragedy strikes he is caught in an industrial accident and he ends up paralysed, and he is flown back to mainland to hospital, and feeling strong grief and distress Bess believes that her prayers are what caused the accident to occur. Jan is really badly affected by the tragedy because he knows his paralysis means it will be pretty much impossible to ever be able to perform sexually with his wife, and knowing the affect it will have on Bess as well he asks her to find a new lover, and shocked she storms out on him, and meanwhile Jan attempts and fails a suicide and unconscious stays in hospital. Slowly his condition deteriorates and he keeps urging his wife to find other men and have sex with them, and tell him everything that happened, all details, so it will seem like they were together and are keeping their love and passion alive, and eventually she tries in small ways to do this, for example, masturbating a man on the bus. Bess comes to believe that what she is doing, when she gives into his idea, are in accordance with her love for Jan, and the will of God, who she eventually starts talking to and using her own voice with again, and despite her guilt and agitation being with other men she does believe she is keeping her husband alive. In the end, after spending so much time branded by those who she knows as a tart or a prostitute, Bess is put into a mental institution, which she escapes from, and a trip to the docks get her sent to hospital where she needs an operation, but it is unsuccessful and Bess dies, while Jan lives on in his wheelchair and she is married at sea. Also starring Katrin Cartlidge as Dodo McNeill, Jean-Marc Barr as Terry, Udo Kier as Sadistic Sailor / Man on the trawler, Adrian Rawlins as Dr. Richardson, Jonathan Hackett as Priest and Sandra Voe as Mother. Watson gives an extraordinary performance as the innocent woman struck by tragedy and forcing herself into sacrifice for her true love, and in his moments Skarsg&aring;rd is likable before his accident and then gives a suitably sympathetic performance, the story is very profound as it exposes how faith and passion can influence decisions, it is very moving and sometimes depressing, but a most watchable drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Very good!

    Definitely not what I was expecting. However, in a very good way. The strong U-turn in the energy of the film is very unsettling since it uses the obvious "destroy something beautiful" plot to evoke emotion in the audience, and so yes it is predictably tragic. A struggle to get through, and I doubt I could face it again, but I don't think I'll ever forget this. It's one of those films which is entirely essential to fans of Von Trier's style, but those who have been unimpressed in the past by him or do not find his style absorbing probably won't find much here. I think the entire film is worth it solely for the ending, which I had been expecting to fizzle and fade out, and just as it had actually done so, the last few scenes arrive with something melancholy yet very special.

If you truly love someone you will be willing to do anything for that person, and in this film you can clearly see this. Another subject talked about in it is faith. How there's a lot of people who don't have faith in a spiritual way, and how they see those who have it as if they where crazy, but what those people ignore is that faith can be something very powerful, even if it's actually not true. "Love... bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails".

    Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), who has psychological problems, marries Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), despite the apprehensions of her community and Calvinist church. Bess is somewhat simple and childlike, and has difficulty living without Jan when he is away on the oil platform, where he is scheduled to work for ten days. She prays for his immediate return, and when he returns the next day paralyzed by an industrial accident, she believes it is her fault. No longer able to perform sexually, and mentally affected by the accident, Jan urges her to find and have sex with other men and then tell him the details. This film also has Udo Kier as the Sadistic Sailor. And Helena Bonham Carter was von Trier's first choice to play the role of Bess, but she dropped out just before shooting was to start, reportedly due to the large amount of nudity and sexuality required by the role. This is a great loss. Breaking the Waves was named one of the ten best films of the decade by both Roger Ebert and Martin Scorsese during a show where the famous film personalities listed their top movies of the 1990s. For me, the thing about this movie is not any lesson we might learn, it is the very definition of love. If one partner is in a coma or incapacitated, does this make it okay for the other partner to pursue physical love elsewhere? What is the other partner fully encourages it? I think this film explores the ins and outs of that very well, including the repulsion Bess feels when trying to touch another man.

    Emily seems to have no choices in her depiction. She is unyielding in her devotion and we truly have no idea why. Yet that is who we are supposed to believe she is. A woman without any input from her surroundings. A woman incapable of perceiving her environment. Perhaps that's just her. That's why my vote is 4 instead of 1. It's a pretty film and a provocative one, yet it is without much value in the real world. Van Trier again demands we exist within his unreal depiction for an hour or two while we sit through the display of our protagonist, unrealistic yet strongly portrayed. Perhaps in this nether world women can be blind and sub-human. She continues on and on without hope. She builds minute after minute into a creature more and more inhuman -- devoted to the unyielding, dried and coarse veins of perfunctory action, rather than traits befitting a human. Finally she dies and we are relieved. Then her husband is renewed and the inhuman circumstances are revealed and portrayed like some after-school special. Dull. Boring. Sad that we had to watch it.

    "Breaking the Waves" is a 1996 romantic drama directed by Lars Von Trier. Bess (Emily Watson) is a strong believer in god, she goes to church frequently and has long talks with him and answers herself as an angry god through her own voice. She marries a nice man named Jan (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd) and they express a great sexual desire for each other, but he soon is paralyzed in an accident. Bess prays for him to return, but then Jan convinces her that the only way he will walk again is if she finds another man to have sex with. It made me realize what a great director Lars Von Trier is, he knows how to make characters feel painfully realistic, which makes his movies a lot more dramatic than others. The movie is equally uplifting and depressing, it deals with themes of faith and religion. Emily Watson's character is like a Disney princess stuck in the real world, struggling to find the bright side of life. I loved the opening to the film, when Bess (Emily Watson) looks at the camera, its like she's asking us to judge her. Apart from that, the rock music was great, it gave me a relaxing feeling that "Dancer in the Dark" didn't, a moment to breath in the middle of all the chaos going on. The dialog between Bess (Emily Watson) and god reminded me of Gollum talking to his other personality in "The Lord of the Rings", I wonder if this film influenced them somehow. I'd recommend it to people who enjoyed movies like "Take Shelter", "Dancer in the Dark", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Closer", or "The Marriage of Maria Braun".

    I love love LOVE Lars Von Trier films. This is a bit of a sleeper in his canon though, as there are films I like better (Antichrist, Dancer In The Dark, and the AMAZING Zentropa) but even then, this film is brilliant. All about a bit of a messed up in the head woman who marries a oil rigger. When he is critically injured, one of his requests is to have her take men on, and tell him about it to make him better. When he gets worse, she feels she's not doing enough. Even though this film is stark and ugly at times, there is some amazing points of beauty. I really did love the chapter intertitles, with it's scenery and music, so amazing. Emily Watson, my god, just blows me away, and that ending, for some dumb reason (I've seen this about 4 times now) made me weep in how beautiful it was.

    I don't know why people see this as a great love story. There is nothing loving or beautiful about how Jan forces his wife (who is clearly not quite "all there") to succumb to his perverse fantasies to gain some power back after he's paralyzed. Classic domestic violence if I ever saw it. Just because he's not hitting her doesn't mean he's not abusing her in the worst possible way. It's also pretty sickening to watch just how ugly religion can get and how fundamentalist christians (most religions, not just christians) could treat an innocent like Bess. A person who is good all the way but also who is probably with an IQ in the lower ranges. Organized religion really IS the root of all evil in this world because humans are the way they are. A male dominated, fundamentalist religious world where violence (sexual and emotional) is the main focus is portrayed very well in this raw movie. Stellan is awesome as always. Very good movie and definitely recommended. I just don't get why all the reviews are about this being a love story, but that's just me.

    Whether one cares for this film or not, Emily Watson gives a performance that will overwhelm audiences for many generations to come. Her interpretation of the character of Bess is beyond anything ever before put on celluloid. That she was not awarded an Academy Award the year she stunned audiences in this film has resulted in Oscars being considered meaningless to anyone appreciative of great acting. In fact, Ms. Watson continues to give deeply of her soul in every subsequent role she has assayed and elevated each film and fellow actors with her work. Her simple beauty and magnificent heart gave life to turgid melodramas such as Angela's Ashes, brilliance to Adam Sandler's vehicle Punch-Drunk love, and set the screen on fire with a never before seen motion picture passion in Hillary and Jackie. A moving children's' piece such as the Water Horse was given depth and realism due to her incredible portrait of the mother and widow whose sexuality roils just beneath the surface of her grief. No other actor, male or female, has left audience members so breathless, so incapacitated, and so staggered by every single performance. Emily Watson is not simply the most gifted actor to ever step before a camera, she is a precious gift to cinema, a jewel beyond price, and the single most important actor of all time. Her work in Breaking the Waves set a bar that few actors could reach again, yet she exceeds that height of authentic greatness time after time. It would not be an overstatement to say that cinema was created as a medium so that Emily Watson's genius as an actor, her unique beauty as a woman, and her authentic expression of life itself could be shared with all humanity across the ages, for all time.

    Featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this was the first English language film from Danish director Lars Von Trier (The Idiots, Dogville), and I was looking forward to watching it for that, and the two then less known leading stars. Basically in a community in the north of Scotland that is repressed and deeply religious lives the young and naive Bess McNeill (introducing Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emily Watson), who has a strong belief in God, to the point where she often talks to herself answering as the voice of the lord, and she has other childlike qualities and some psychological problems. Despite this she is happily married to oil Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), and they enjoy each other's company in the time they have together, but she finds it very difficult to be without him while he works on the platform, only making occasional phone calls discussing their love and sexual desires, including her talking about his prick. Bess prays for Jan to return immediately home, but tragedy strikes he is caught in an industrial accident and he ends up paralysed, and he is flown back to mainland to hospital, and feeling strong grief and distress Bess believes that her prayers are what caused the accident to occur. Jan is really badly affected by the tragedy because he knows his paralysis means it will be pretty much impossible to ever be able to perform sexually with his wife, and knowing the affect it will have on Bess as well he asks her to find a new lover, and shocked she storms out on him, and meanwhile Jan attempts and fails a suicide and unconscious stays in hospital. Slowly his condition deteriorates and he keeps urging his wife to find other men and have sex with them, and tell him everything that happened, all details, so it will seem like they were together and are keeping their love and passion alive, and eventually she tries in small ways to do this, for example, masturbating a man on the bus. Bess comes to believe that what she is doing, when she gives into his idea, are in accordance with her love for Jan, and the will of God, who she eventually starts talking to and using her own voice with again, and despite her guilt and agitation being with other men she does believe she is keeping her husband alive. In the end, after spending so much time branded by those who she knows as a tart or a prostitute, Bess is put into a mental institution, which she escapes from, and a trip to the docks get her sent to hospital where she needs an operation, but it is unsuccessful and Bess dies, while Jan lives on in his wheelchair and she is married at sea. Also starring Katrin Cartlidge as Dodo McNeill, Jean-Marc Barr as Terry, Udo Kier as Sadistic Sailor / Man on the trawler, Adrian Rawlins as Dr. Richardson, Jonathan Hackett as Priest and Sandra Voe as Mother. Watson gives an extraordinary performance as the innocent woman struck by tragedy and forcing herself into sacrifice for her true love, and in his moments Skarsg&aring;rd is likable before his accident and then gives a suitably sympathetic performance, the story is very profound as it exposes how faith and passion can influence decisions, it is very moving and sometimes depressing, but a most watchable drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Very good!

    Definitely not what I was expecting. However, in a very good way. The strong U-turn in the energy of the film is very unsettling since it uses the obvious "destroy something beautiful" plot to evoke emotion in the audience, and so yes it is predictably tragic. A struggle to get through, and I doubt I could face it again, but I don't think I'll ever forget this. It's one of those films which is entirely essential to fans of Von Trier's style, but those who have been unimpressed in the past by him or do not find his style absorbing probably won't find much here. I think the entire film is worth it solely for the ending, which I had been expecting to fizzle and fade out, and just as it had actually done so, the last few scenes arrive with something melancholy yet very special.

If you truly love someone you will be willing to do anything for that person, and in this film you can clearly see this. Another subject talked about in it is faith. How there's a lot of people who don't have faith in a spiritual way, and how they see those who have it as if they where crazy, but what those people ignore is that faith can be something very powerful, even if it's actually not true. "Love... bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails".

    Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), who has psychological problems, marries Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), despite the apprehensions of her community and Calvinist church. Bess is somewhat simple and childlike, and has difficulty living without Jan when he is away on the oil platform, where he is scheduled to work for ten days. She prays for his immediate return, and when he returns the next day paralyzed by an industrial accident, she believes it is her fault. No longer able to perform sexually, and mentally affected by the accident, Jan urges her to find and have sex with other men and then tell him the details. This film also has Udo Kier as the Sadistic Sailor. And Helena Bonham Carter was von Trier's first choice to play the role of Bess, but she dropped out just before shooting was to start, reportedly due to the large amount of nudity and sexuality required by the role. This is a great loss. Breaking the Waves was named one of the ten best films of the decade by both Roger Ebert and Martin Scorsese during a show where the famous film personalities listed their top movies of the 1990s. For me, the thing about this movie is not any lesson we might learn, it is the very definition of love. If one partner is in a coma or incapacitated, does this make it okay for the other partner to pursue physical love elsewhere? What is the other partner fully encourages it? I think this film explores the ins and outs of that very well, including the repulsion Bess feels when trying to touch another man.
