 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  "You won't leave me, will you?" Nick asks Brandon shortly after revealing to him the results of his last blood test for HIV. "I don't want to die alone." In spite of Brandon's protestations, the two soon find the love they had shared for many years in ruins. One year after their breakup, Nick is confronted with a ravaged immune system and a CT Scan and lab values which, along with his worsening forgetfulness, clenches the diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) -- a condition he has seen claim his friends and one which he vows will not take him. Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, he has only a few days of conscious life remaining. His plan, he announces to family and "extended family," is to voluntarily end his life himself before the disease renders him unrecognizable to those he loves and he, in turn, is unable to recognize them. Uninvited to the farewell party, Brandon's presence is greeted with jeers from those who see him as having abandoned Nick ...

    Please keep in mind that this is based on actual events...if you rent this, do yourself a favor and re-watch some scenes with the commentary turned ON. This is not "Hollywood" at its best or its worst, as some have said. Hollywood did not invent this story. Some of the drama was added for effect (some of the conflict, for example), but the events were based on the life (end of life) of Harry Stein. It is difficult to watch because of all of the conflicting emotions; the agonizing effort of the characters trying to be uplifting and funny in the face of devastation. It's was difficult for me because I know people in similar situations, so much of it was very realistic to me.

    Writer-director Randal Kleiser does fine, fluid work here with this moving hybrid of "The Boys in the Band" and "'Night, Mother". When an upwardly-mobile gay man in Southern California gets a dreaded HIV-positive diagnosis, it helps to end the relationship he had with his lover; one year later, the two men find themselves reunited after the infected one discovers he has lesions on his brain and decides to throw a farewell party for himself before committing suicide. Movies centering on big, noisy parties rarely work, but Kleiser's accuracy in capturing this (not all gay) eclectic group of family and friends shows off a great deal of heart, sentiment, and a small bit of the requisite bitchy humor. A wonderfully odd gathering of celebrities and character-actors pop up in cameo roles, however the leads (Eric Roberts and Gregory Harrison) are the most surprising; with the help of astute editing, they are able to create a rapport that seems heartfelt and real, and Roberts in particular does some of his best work ever. Kleiser wanted this to be a celebration of life, not the mourning of a death, and he pulls it off with aplomb. **1/2 from ****

    Absolute dreck, even by movie-of-the-week, "we're trying to humanize AIDS" standards. Interesting only (and only briefly) from a sort of historical perspective on Hollywood's (mercifully brief) goody-two-shoes approach to AIDS, it helps explain Gregg Araki and the rest of the "rebound," which was, more than anything, a demand for an end to stories about rich, squeaky-clean white boys who die beautifully while spouting deep philosophy about the Meaning of it All. So incredibly painful to watch.... Most of the scenes played hardest and most desperately for emotion and tears simply make one laugh at how inept and Hallmark they are. Eric Roberts, never a great actor, is utterly unbelievable here, but only slightly less so than the cross-eyed Gregory Harrison as his lover. Marlee Matlin does the standard turn she did in the 1990s in every politically correct film ever made; George Segal is pathetic; and Lee Grant plays her "tragic" role with all the subtlety of a meat ax. The soundtrack is soupy and sappy, and you need only compare what Randal Kleiser got out of Bruce Davidson in this film with what Norman Ren&eacute; got out of him in _Longtime Companion_ (1990) to understand that Kleiser is a rank amateur. I can only imagine that some diabetes-inducing sentiment along the lines of "let's make a film for 'the boys'" is what got this cadre of red-ribbon wearing stars to participate in a travesty of such monumental proportions; at this point, the only kindness would be to burn all the copies and pretend it never happened.

    Masqueraring as a comedy when it clearly is not, Randall Kleiser's IT'S MY PARTY is a study in self-absorption and schmaltz that probably started with good intentions but became a mass of sweeping fragility swathed in pathos and cheap emotions. The premise is that a man, dying of AIDS, has decided to throw an all-out party where he will announce that he will commit suicide. An engaging extrovert, he displays the frenetic optimism precisely found in manic-depressives or people who tend to carry a load with stoic abandon until they no longer can carry it by themselves. Of course, this movie never bothers to truly dive in deep into Nick Stark's (Eric Roberts) psyche -- all we know is what we know and we're given some access into his past via flashbacks, but even then, they only serve as a point of reference, never as a true picture. And then, predictably, his ultimate decision, which is so ridiculous that I wondered if Nick wasn't really a woman pretending to be a man. Talk about a tragic heroine! At least Lee Remick has more to do as his mother, and oddly enough, the movie totally forgets about her and chooses instead to concentrate solely on the mechanics of the party, Nick's botched relationship with Brandon (Gregory Harrison) who left him when he learned of Nick's illness and has come to (maybe?) make amends, and scenes that spell Cute and Tender all the way. I didn't buy it then, I still don't buy it now, and I certainly can't recommend a movie where a gay man decides that the best way to go is with a bang, even at the expense of family members and close friends. That's the ultimate act of selfishness, even if this is only a story. There will be some sentimentalists out there who will weep their eyes out at the sole mention of this pile of dreck, but not me.

    Great movie,that shows so much about being human and the trials along with it. Very powerful, I cried when it was over. IT shows that even if we are mad or upset we can overcome and that love is forever. It also shows that we all have a weakness towards something and we have to overcome it or risk losing those closest to us. Going thru this movie and seeing how people are affected by an immanent event and how they come to terms with it, shows that we can be compassionate and move past things, especially with the main couple in the this movie. It has taught me many things and I woke up often the night after I watched it thinking about it and my own relationships. A must see!

    I watched this movie on TV after having read some pretty good reviews, but I was soon disgusted, even on the verge of getting angry. Really hate to say so, but I think this movie is a most pretentious mistake considering the serious issue it's dealing with. It is filled with a tremendous amount of bad clich&eacute;s, it appears false, and it's overly schmaltzy: a really hokey movie. Frankly, I can't understand how anyone living a real life could be deeply moved by this truly bad "imitation of life". Even if this originally was a low-budget production with the best of intentions - it turns out to be "Hollywood" at its worst.

    I borrowed 'It's My Party' from the library this weekend; a coincidentally timely moment to see this film as this weekend marked milestones in the discovery of AIDs, with MSN's homepage having stories this week on both the 25 years of AIDs in America as well as the struggles in Africa with the disease. This is a particularly sad film (although which one isn't?) about Nick Stark (Eric Roberts), a young West Coast architect who was diagnosed with HIV some time ago and learns from his doctor that he has reached a particularly debilitating stage of the disease known as PML. Not wanting to live life in any sort of semi-conscious state, he decides to commit suicide in a rather dignified way before the stages of disease advance any further. The Party, in the title of this film, refers to the sort of substitution of a funeral for a party, one in which Nick, his friends, and family will gather around to enjoy the last few good times they might have together. He wants no sorrow and no tears and certainly no funeral or wake. This is how he wants to say goodbye. Nick will be among many of his friends to have died from the disease, although this film relegates the disease solely to that of homosexual men, which I would caution in Hollywood because of the misconceptions that is a disease that only affects gay men. But nonetheless, this is the story of a gay man who has seen many of his friends die to the disease. The particularly sad thing is that you share among the assorted celebration (although not all of it is a particularly joyous occasion obviously because people are aware of Nick's plan to end his life) and in the end, the viewer may be fooled by their Hollywood conditioned expectations that somehow Nick will live in the end and everything will be okay. This is one film with a particularly familiar and good cast which join together in sort of an awareness project that reminds me of the Laramie Project made some time later. This, at least according to the trivia, is based on actual events that occurred in the early 90s.

    I can't believe this movie was made 10 years ago and I never even heard of it before the other day. I was out of town on business, and the hotel I stayed in had Showtime. I fell asleep with the TV on one night, and woke up around 1:30 a.m. This movie was just coming on and it grabbed me immediately. I stayed up and watched the whole thing! I thought it was very well acted and was surprised at the cast of characters. It certainly was a tearjerker, but there were lots of laughs thrown in. I've not seen a lot of movies featuring homosexual relationships, much less ones that were more than a source of a lot of jokes. This one was very touching and I found myself rooting for the characters to work things out. I would totally recommend this movie for anyone looking to see something a little out of the ordinary.

    Although, a tear-jerker.....I loved it! True life! The actors/actresses were all fantastic! I love Eric Roberts, anyway. Many terrific people in this movie, including Lee Grant, Devon Gummersall, Paul Regina (love him), George Segal and many more. Could really relate to this movie as to what has happened in my own life. If I had to choose, my choice would be the same as Eric Roberts in this film. I could put myself in so many shoes on this film ~ Gregory Harrison's thoughts, Lee Grant's feelings, Margaret Chou being a friend to Eric, etc. You have to see it! I'm adding it to my DVD collection ~ yes worth watching over and over!

    Writer-director Randal Kleiser does fine, fluid work here with this moving hybrid of "The Boys in the Band" and "'Night, Mother". When an upwardly-mobile gay man in Southern California gets a dreaded HIV-positive diagnosis, it helps to end the relationship he had with his lover; one year later, the two men find themselves reunited after the infected one discovers he has lesions on his brain and decides to throw a farewell party for himself before committing suicide. Movies centering on big, noisy parties rarely work, but Kleiser's accuracy in capturing this (not all gay) eclectic group of family and friends shows off a great deal of heart, sentiment, and a small bit of the requisite bitchy humor. A wonderfully odd gathering of celebrities and character-actors pop up in cameo roles, however the leads (Eric Roberts and Gregory Harrison) are the most surprising; with the help of astute editing, they are able to create a rapport that seems heartfelt and real, and Roberts in particular does some of his best work ever. Kleiser wanted this to be a celebration of life, not the mourning of a death, and he pulls it off with aplomb. **1/2 from ****

    Absolute dreck, even by movie-of-the-week, "we're trying to humanize AIDS" standards. Interesting only (and only briefly) from a sort of historical perspective on Hollywood's (mercifully brief) goody-two-shoes approach to AIDS, it helps explain Gregg Araki and the rest of the "rebound," which was, more than anything, a demand for an end to stories about rich, squeaky-clean white boys who die beautifully while spouting deep philosophy about the Meaning of it All. So incredibly painful to watch.... Most of the scenes played hardest and most desperately for emotion and tears simply make one laugh at how inept and Hallmark they are. Eric Roberts, never a great actor, is utterly unbelievable here, but only slightly less so than the cross-eyed Gregory Harrison as his lover. Marlee Matlin does the standard turn she did in the 1990s in every politically correct film ever made; George Segal is pathetic; and Lee Grant plays her "tragic" role with all the subtlety of a meat ax. The soundtrack is soupy and sappy, and you need only compare what Randal Kleiser got out of Bruce Davidson in this film with what Norman Ren&eacute; got out of him in _Longtime Companion_ (1990) to understand that Kleiser is a rank amateur. I can only imagine that some diabetes-inducing sentiment along the lines of "let's make a film for 'the boys'" is what got this cadre of red-ribbon wearing stars to participate in a travesty of such monumental proportions; at this point, the only kindness would be to burn all the copies and pretend it never happened.

    Masqueraring as a comedy when it clearly is not, Randall Kleiser's IT'S MY PARTY is a study in self-absorption and schmaltz that probably started with good intentions but became a mass of sweeping fragility swathed in pathos and cheap emotions. The premise is that a man, dying of AIDS, has decided to throw an all-out party where he will announce that he will commit suicide. An engaging extrovert, he displays the frenetic optimism precisely found in manic-depressives or people who tend to carry a load with stoic abandon until they no longer can carry it by themselves. Of course, this movie never bothers to truly dive in deep into Nick Stark's (Eric Roberts) psyche -- all we know is what we know and we're given some access into his past via flashbacks, but even then, they only serve as a point of reference, never as a true picture. And then, predictably, his ultimate decision, which is so ridiculous that I wondered if Nick wasn't really a woman pretending to be a man. Talk about a tragic heroine! At least Lee Remick has more to do as his mother, and oddly enough, the movie totally forgets about her and chooses instead to concentrate solely on the mechanics of the party, Nick's botched relationship with Brandon (Gregory Harrison) who left him when he learned of Nick's illness and has come to (maybe?) make amends, and scenes that spell Cute and Tender all the way. I didn't buy it then, I still don't buy it now, and I certainly can't recommend a movie where a gay man decides that the best way to go is with a bang, even at the expense of family members and close friends. That's the ultimate act of selfishness, even if this is only a story. There will be some sentimentalists out there who will weep their eyes out at the sole mention of this pile of dreck, but not me.

    Great movie,that shows so much about being human and the trials along with it. Very powerful, I cried when it was over. IT shows that even if we are mad or upset we can overcome and that love is forever. It also shows that we all have a weakness towards something and we have to overcome it or risk losing those closest to us. Going thru this movie and seeing how people are affected by an immanent event and how they come to terms with it, shows that we can be compassionate and move past things, especially with the main couple in the this movie. It has taught me many things and I woke up often the night after I watched it thinking about it and my own relationships. A must see!

    I watched this movie on TV after having read some pretty good reviews, but I was soon disgusted, even on the verge of getting angry. Really hate to say so, but I think this movie is a most pretentious mistake considering the serious issue it's dealing with. It is filled with a tremendous amount of bad clich&eacute;s, it appears false, and it's overly schmaltzy: a really hokey movie. Frankly, I can't understand how anyone living a real life could be deeply moved by this truly bad "imitation of life". Even if this originally was a low-budget production with the best of intentions - it turns out to be "Hollywood" at its worst.

    I borrowed 'It's My Party' from the library this weekend; a coincidentally timely moment to see this film as this weekend marked milestones in the discovery of AIDs, with MSN's homepage having stories this week on both the 25 years of AIDs in America as well as the struggles in Africa with the disease. This is a particularly sad film (although which one isn't?) about Nick Stark (Eric Roberts), a young West Coast architect who was diagnosed with HIV some time ago and learns from his doctor that he has reached a particularly debilitating stage of the disease known as PML. Not wanting to live life in any sort of semi-conscious state, he decides to commit suicide in a rather dignified way before the stages of disease advance any further. The Party, in the title of this film, refers to the sort of substitution of a funeral for a party, one in which Nick, his friends, and family will gather around to enjoy the last few good times they might have together. He wants no sorrow and no tears and certainly no funeral or wake. This is how he wants to say goodbye. Nick will be among many of his friends to have died from the disease, although this film relegates the disease solely to that of homosexual men, which I would caution in Hollywood because of the misconceptions that is a disease that only affects gay men. But nonetheless, this is the story of a gay man who has seen many of his friends die to the disease. The particularly sad thing is that you share among the assorted celebration (although not all of it is a particularly joyous occasion obviously because people are aware of Nick's plan to end his life) and in the end, the viewer may be fooled by their Hollywood conditioned expectations that somehow Nick will live in the end and everything will be okay. This is one film with a particularly familiar and good cast which join together in sort of an awareness project that reminds me of the Laramie Project made some time later. This, at least according to the trivia, is based on actual events that occurred in the early 90s.

    I can't believe this movie was made 10 years ago and I never even heard of it before the other day. I was out of town on business, and the hotel I stayed in had Showtime. I fell asleep with the TV on one night, and woke up around 1:30 a.m. This movie was just coming on and it grabbed me immediately. I stayed up and watched the whole thing! I thought it was very well acted and was surprised at the cast of characters. It certainly was a tearjerker, but there were lots of laughs thrown in. I've not seen a lot of movies featuring homosexual relationships, much less ones that were more than a source of a lot of jokes. This one was very touching and I found myself rooting for the characters to work things out. I would totally recommend this movie for anyone looking to see something a little out of the ordinary.

    Although, a tear-jerker.....I loved it! True life! The actors/actresses were all fantastic! I love Eric Roberts, anyway. Many terrific people in this movie, including Lee Grant, Devon Gummersall, Paul Regina (love him), George Segal and many more. Could really relate to this movie as to what has happened in my own life. If I had to choose, my choice would be the same as Eric Roberts in this film. I could put myself in so many shoes on this film ~ Gregory Harrison's thoughts, Lee Grant's feelings, Margaret Chou being a friend to Eric, etc. You have to see it! I'm adding it to my DVD collection ~ yes worth watching over and over!

    Please keep in mind that this is based on actual events...if you rent this, do yourself a favor and re-watch some scenes with the commentary turned ON. This is not "Hollywood" at its best or its worst, as some have said. Hollywood did not invent this story. Some of the drama was added for effect (some of the conflict, for example), but the events were based on the life (end of life) of Harry Stein. It is difficult to watch because of all of the conflicting emotions; the agonizing effort of the characters trying to be uplifting and funny in the face of devastation. It's was difficult for me because I know people in similar situations, so much of it was very realistic to me.

Marlee Matlin does the standard turn she did in the 1990s in every politically correct film ever made; George Segal is pathetic; and Lee Grant plays her "tragic" role with all the subtlety of a meat ax. The soundtrack is soupy and sappy, and you need only compare what Randal Kleiser got out of Bruce Davidson in this film with what Norman Ren&eacute; got out of him in _Longtime Companion_ (1990) to understand that Kleiser is a rank amateur. I can only imagine that some diabetes-inducing sentiment along the lines of "let's make a film for 'the boys'" is what got this cadre of red-ribbon wearing stars to participate in a travesty of such monumental proportions; at this point, the only kindness would be to burn all the copies and pretend it never happened.

    Masqueraring as a comedy when it clearly is not, Randall Kleiser's IT'S MY PARTY is a study in self-absorption and schmaltz that probably started with good intentions but became a mass of sweeping fragility swathed in pathos and cheap emotions. The premise is that a man, dying of AIDS, has decided to throw an all-out party where he will announce that he will commit suicide. An engaging extrovert, he displays the frenetic optimism precisely found in manic-depressives or people who tend to carry a load with stoic abandon until they no longer can carry it by themselves. Of course, this movie never bothers to truly dive in deep into Nick Stark's (Eric Roberts) psyche -- all we know is what we know and we're given some access into his past via flashbacks, but even then, they only serve as a point of reference, never as a true picture. And then, predictably, his ultimate decision, which is so ridiculous that I wondered if Nick wasn't really a woman pretending to be a man. Talk about a tragic heroine! At least Lee Remick has more to do as his mother, and oddly enough, the movie totally forgets about her and chooses instead to concentrate solely on the mechanics of the party, Nick's botched relationship with Brandon (Gregory Harrison) who left him when he learned of Nick's illness and has come to (maybe?) make amends, and scenes that spell Cute and Tender all the way. I didn't buy it then, I still don't buy it now, and I certainly can't recommend a movie where a gay man decides that the best way to go is with a bang, even at the expense of family members and close friends. That's the ultimate act of selfishness, even if this is only a story. There will be some sentimentalists out there who will weep their eyes out at the sole mention of this pile of dreck, but not me.

    Great movie,that shows so much about being human and the trials along with it. Very powerful, I cried when it was over. IT shows that even if we are mad or upset we can overcome and that love is forever. It also shows that we all have a weakness towards something and we have to overcome it or risk losing those closest to us. Going thru this movie and seeing how people are affected by an immanent event and how they come to terms with it, shows that we can be compassionate and move past things, especially with the main couple in the this movie. It has taught me many things and I woke up often the night after I watched it thinking about it and my own relationships. A must see!

    I watched this movie on TV after having read some pretty good reviews, but I was soon disgusted, even on the verge of getting angry. Really hate to say so, but I think this movie is a most pretentious mistake considering the serious issue it's dealing with. It is filled with a tremendous amount of bad clich&eacute;s, it appears false, and it's overly schmaltzy: a really hokey movie. Frankly, I can't understand how anyone living a real life could be deeply moved by this truly bad "imitation of life". Even if this originally was a low-budget production with the best of intentions - it turns out to be "Hollywood" at its worst.

    I borrowed 'It's My Party' from the library this weekend; a coincidentally timely moment to see this film as this weekend marked milestones in the discovery of AIDs, with MSN's homepage having stories this week on both the 25 years of AIDs in America as well as the struggles in Africa with the disease. This is a particularly sad film (although which one isn't?) about Nick Stark (Eric Roberts), a young West Coast architect who was diagnosed with HIV some time ago and learns from his doctor that he has reached a particularly debilitating stage of the disease known as PML. Not wanting to live life in any sort of semi-conscious state, he decides to commit suicide in a rather dignified way before the stages of disease advance any further. The Party, in the title of this film, refers to the sort of substitution of a funeral for a party, one in which Nick, his friends, and family will gather around to enjoy the last few good times they might have together. He wants no sorrow and no tears and certainly no funeral or wake. This is how he wants to say goodbye. Nick will be among many of his friends to have died from the disease, although this film relegates the disease solely to that of homosexual men, which I would caution in Hollywood because of the misconceptions that is a disease that only affects gay men. But nonetheless, this is the story of a gay man who has seen many of his friends die to the disease. The particularly sad thing is that you share among the assorted celebration (although not all of it is a particularly joyous occasion obviously because people are aware of Nick's plan to end his life) and in the end, the viewer may be fooled by their Hollywood conditioned expectations that somehow Nick will live in the end and everything will be okay. This is one film with a particularly familiar and good cast which join together in sort of an awareness project that reminds me of the Laramie Project made some time later. This, at least according to the trivia, is based on actual events that occurred in the early 90s.

    I can't believe this movie was made 10 years ago and I never even heard of it before the other day. I was out of town on business, and the hotel I stayed in had Showtime. I fell asleep with the TV on one night, and woke up around 1:30 a.m. This movie was just coming on and it grabbed me immediately. I stayed up and watched the whole thing! I thought it was very well acted and was surprised at the cast of characters. It certainly was a tearjerker, but there were lots of laughs thrown in. I've not seen a lot of movies featuring homosexual relationships, much less ones that were more than a source of a lot of jokes. This one was very touching and I found myself rooting for the characters to work things out. I would totally recommend this movie for anyone looking to see something a little out of the ordinary.

    Although, a tear-jerker.....I loved it! True life! The actors/actresses were all fantastic! I love Eric Roberts, anyway. Many terrific people in this movie, including Lee Grant, Devon Gummersall, Paul Regina (love him), George Segal and many more. Could really relate to this movie as to what has happened in my own life. If I had to choose, my choice would be the same as Eric Roberts in this film. I could put myself in so many shoes on this film ~ Gregory Harrison's thoughts, Lee Grant's feelings, Margaret Chou being a friend to Eric, etc. You have to see it! I'm adding it to my DVD collection ~ yes worth watching over and over!

    Please keep in mind that this is based on actual events...if you rent this, do yourself a favor and re-watch some scenes with the commentary turned ON. This is not "Hollywood" at its best or its worst, as some have said. Hollywood did not invent this story. Some of the drama was added for effect (some of the conflict, for example), but the events were based on the life (end of life) of Harry Stein. It is difficult to watch because of all of the conflicting emotions; the agonizing effort of the characters trying to be uplifting and funny in the face of devastation. It's was difficult for me because I know people in similar situations, so much of it was very realistic to me.

    wow after watching this trust me their will not be a dry eye in the place. a man finds out he has tested positive for AIDS, and he only has so long to live,, he tells his partner,, who doesn't really take it that well, as time passes we see what slowly starts to happen to our main character,, played by Eric Roberts. His lover leaves him in a quarrel, and now we pick up the story a year later, when he learns from the doctor that he only has a few days to live. after that sombering news he decides to have a farewell party for his family and friends, he invites everyone that has touched his life,, and a few people show up uninvited also, which thickens the plot,, including his former lover who tries to make peace with Nick. there are many Hollywood stars in this Bronson Pinchot, Bruce Davison, Olivia Newton John , Roddy Macdowell,, and many many other, too numerous too mention,, this is an engrossing movie and you better have a box of Kleenex handy.. you will need it.

    Writer-director Randal Kleiser does fine, fluid work here with this moving hybrid of "The Boys in the Band" and "'Night, Mother". When an upwardly-mobile gay man in Southern California gets a dreaded HIV-positive diagnosis, it helps to end the relationship he had with his lover; one year later, the two men find themselves reunited after the infected one discovers he has lesions on his brain and decides to throw a farewell party for himself before committing suicide. Movies centering on big, noisy parties rarely work, but Kleiser's accuracy in capturing this (not all gay) eclectic group of family and friends shows off a great deal of heart, sentiment, and a small bit of the requisite bitchy humor. A wonderfully odd gathering of celebrities and character-actors pop up in cameo roles, however the leads (Eric Roberts and Gregory Harrison) are the most surprising; with the help of astute editing, they are able to create a rapport that seems heartfelt and real, and Roberts in particular does some of his best work ever. Kleiser wanted this to be a celebration of life, not the mourning of a death, and he pulls it off with aplomb. **1/2 from ****

    Absolute dreck, even by movie-of-the-week, "we're trying to humanize AIDS" standards. Interesting only (and only briefly) from a sort of historical perspective on Hollywood's (mercifully brief) goody-two-shoes approach to AIDS, it helps explain Gregg Araki and the rest of the "rebound," which was, more than anything, a demand for an end to stories about rich, squeaky-clean white boys who die beautifully while spouting deep philosophy about the Meaning of it All. So incredibly painful to watch.... Most of the scenes played hardest and most desperately for emotion and tears simply make one laugh at how inept and Hallmark they are. Eric Roberts, never a great actor, is utterly unbelievable here, but only slightly less so than the cross-eyed Gregory Harrison as his lover. Marlee Matlin does the standard turn she did in the 1990s in every politically correct film ever made; George Segal is pathetic; and Lee Grant plays her "tragic" role with all the subtlety of a meat ax.
