    Uncreative, absurd plot, poorly shot, ridiculous acting and, above all, tremendously unfunny! I'm an easy going person and, still, this movie was a torture to watch. I would actually have stopped watching it after 15 or 20 minutes but, since reviews had been kind of okay, I kept at it hoping the movie would improve. Unfortunately it only got worse with every passing minute. And please don't think I "simply didn't get it". I fully understood the supposed satire Waters was trying to produce. It simply didn't work. Watching this film was a complete waste of my time, except for the fact that it will keep me away from any other Waters movies.

    I wasn't familiar with director John Waters or dark/black humor-except the Addams Family movies. But since 1993 to the present, I've familiarized myself w/ a lot more. For starters, this was my first movie by JW and one of the first with Kathleen Turner. I first watched this at age 13, so needless to say, I was rather naive then. I've owned it on VHS, DVD(both editions) so obviously, it's one of my favorites. Along with Kathleen Turner, it also stars Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard as their adult kids, and Sam Waterston as a rather goofy husband. Most of the murders look so goofy, you can't possibly take this seriously, but maybe that was the point. Plus, her killing motives are goofy, not to mention ridiculous, although most involved slander of her family, subtle or major. Even after (finally) seeing Pink Flamingos- funny but gross) Cecil B. Demented-talk about bizarre) Cry-baby-some good musical numbers, both versions of Hairspray-both fairly enjoyable to me, and lastly, Pecker is probably my least favorite, Serial Mom remains my all-time favorite John Waters movie, to this day.

    Kathleen Turner rocks the house and her neighborhood as the picture-perfect mom who takes matters into her own hands to correct behaviors she considers bad manners. And if murder is the method in which she either corrects these behaviors (or simply eliminates them altogether), that's just too bad, because like fellow John Waters heroine Edna Turnblad ("Hairspray"), her diet pill is wearing off, and like Francine Fishpaw of "Polyester", she just can't take any more heartbreak! Imagine if Divine had lived long enough to do this movie. The obese drag queen would have added a grotesque image to the character of Beverly Sutphin, suburban Baltimore wife and mother who doesn't allow her children to use "the brown word", has a police officer remove the gum he's chewing, and treats her hard-working garbage men to mini-bottles as she comments on neighbor Mary Catlett's refusal to recycle. Then, there's the "Annie" watching video store customer of her son's who refuses to rewind (taken care of deliciously to the song "Tomorrow", much like the art patron bludgeoned in "A Clockwork Orange" to "Singin' in the Rain"), the math teacher who considers her son a wastrel, and the patient of her dentist husband who upsets her even more as she plots his and his wife's demise by eating cute Cornish hens. Taking care of all of these ne'er-do-wells (in her mind) is Kathleen Turner at her most beautiful, her husky voice perfectly suited to an obscene phone call to obnoxious neighbor Mink Stole, and deliciously rubbing it in later on in an extremely funny court scene where she wins over one witness by doing a "Basic Instinct" Sharon Stone impression for him. She also gets to visit a men's bathroom in a hysterically gross sequence where she takes care of daughter Rikki Lake's boyfriend who has dumped her for none other than Tracy Lords. Sound like another visit to Stepford? This is one woman who hasn't been robotized for her man (Sam Waterston), even though she goes out of her way to please him much to her children's discomfort. Turner rocks in this film, and while it definitely continues her "camp" quotient, it also as a "quote quotient" of hysterically funny memorable lines that have ended up as sketches in various drag shows across the country. John Waters adds just enough bad taste to keep the film amusing throughout, and you will not soon forget it. In fact, you may find yourself watching the film over just as soon as you've finished it to make sure you didn't miss anything the first time!

    Beverly Sutphin seems to be the perfect Baltimore housewife; she cares for her family, does the recycling, she even likes the birds that come to her gardenshe is also a killer! To begin with her crimes were limited to making obscene phone calls to one of her neighbours but when one of her son's teachers says he thinks he needs psychiatric help because of the violent pictures he draws... he has to go. The police are soon suspicious but there is no firm evidence. Soon she strikes again; killing the boy who dumped her daughter. With the police following her it looks as though she won't be able to kill again but she soon does. By the time she is finally arrested six people have died at her hands! Her family are obviously somewhat disturbed by it all but that doesn't stop her son and his friend Birdie helping her escape at one point. Once caught she is put on trial and with all the evidence there is no way she will get off is there? This is a difficult film to categorise; on the one hand the comedy it delivered with a light touch on the other the subject matter is dark and there is plenty to offend those who are bothered by swearing or violence. Kathleen Turner is great as the psychotic 'perfect mother'; I loved how her character was willing to murder but couldn't tolerate the slightest social faux pas. While it is very much her movie she is ably supported by Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard and Patricia Dunnock amongst others. The violence isn't too gory; in fact the way it is portrayed is fairly funny in a bad taste sort of way! After the murders things get even funnier when Beverly is put on trial; she hilariously discredits each of the witnesses in a way that could only work in a comedy such as this. I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who wants a good laugh but isn't easily offended.

    Can we safely say that if John Waters' name wasn't plaster all over this thing, it wouldn't have gotten half as many good reviews as it did. I feel as if people like his movies BECAUSE they're so terrible. It's not the subject matter that is a turn off to me, it's that John Waters doesn't know how to write. Good grief, can we take an unbiased look at the film and point out how God awful the dialogue is? Who the hell says "You bring me such peace" during sex? The characters in crappy movies like this one. The plot is so contrived. How did she know her victim would stop running long enough for her to drop an AC on him. Everything just happens to fit into place for the main character. There are so many things that are just awkwardly unrealistic. Of course, if you're being chased by a murderous woman, you're OBVIOUSLY gonna wanna try to hide in a venue that for some strange reason is having band play at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. Id say that since the 20th anniversary of Serial Mom is coming up, we should all celebrate by pretending this turd was never pushed out.

    This mainstream effort from the great cult director John Waters is a blackly hilarious treat, taking satirical jabs at suburbia, family life, and the celebrity treatment often afforded real life criminals. Kathleen Turner shines in one of her best roles as Beverly Sutphin, a beaming suburban mom with a loyal dentist husband (Sam Waterston), a lonely daughter (Ricki Lake), and a horror genre obsessed son (Matthew Lillard, warming up for his not dissimilar role in "Scream"). The trouble is, Beverly is easily annoyed, and any person who offends her sets of values or threatens the sanctity of her family will find their time to be extremely short. Eventually, she's caught, and her trial is turned into something of a circus, with tie in products being peddled such as a book adaptation and T-shirts. The portrayal of the way that killers can become a part of the popular culture is really spot on. "Serial Mom" goes so far as to make a point of the inevitable made for TV version of the events, with Suzanne Somers, doing a cameo as herself, tapped to play Beverly and hanging around as the trial unfolds. The delightful tongue in cheek approach shows how people start rallying around Serial Mom and find the actions of those she hates - such as not recycling - much more heinous than anything she does. Waters's wicked sense of humour is just great, especially when he has a victim bludgeoned with a leg of lamb while the song "Tomorrow" from the 1982 film version of "Annnie" serves as accompaniment. Waters has fun with his methods of murder, not taking them too seriously and not having any two alike; as a result, there's not much in the way of gore. (Although there is one priceless darkly comedic gag when it comes to the heart of one victim.) Waters maintains a likably self referential approach, and clips from movies such as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", "Blood Feast", and "Double Agent 73" show on screen, making this movie a treat to watch for cult film fans. The acting is enjoyable, from Waters regulars such as Mink Stole, Patricia Hearst, and Traci Lords, with Patricia Dunnock a delight as Lillard's gal pal. The movie has good energy, maintaining a nice off the wall sensibility from start to finish. It's just too hard to resist. Eight out of 10.

    Kathleen Turner is hilarious as a mass murderess in director John Water's "Serial Mom" about a housewife who embarks on a homicidal rampage in Baltimore, Maryland. This wonderfully subversive black comedy depicts an apparently PTA mom who begins swapping flies and then graduates to cold-blooded murder. As Beverly Sutphin, Turner kills anybody who offends her dentist husband, gorehound movie buff son, and her hopeless romantic daughter. Nevertheless, Bev is pretty far gone before the spree unspools. The police are canvassing the neighborhood for an obscene caller initially when they poke their inquisitive noses in at Beverly's house. Waters ridicules everything from gory exploitation movies to culinary habits. Nobody escapes notice in this outrageous laugh riot except perhaps gay people. Beverly racks up seven murders to her credit, killing her victims with everything from a knife to a leg of lamb to a toppled air conditioner. Interestingly, Beverly's last victim is none other than Patty Hearst. Throughout it all, Turner similes and slays. Ultimately, of course, our leading lady is charged with murder and lands in court where she dismisses her attorney and conducts her defense. "Serial Mom" is such a bright, shiny, polished epic that it is difficult to believe that it is so bloodthirsty. Mind you, the language gets rather profane at times. Lots of pop culture references spring up, ranging from Suzanne Somers to Bill Cosby movies. Despite all the carefree blood and gore, the most agonizing scene occurs when we are forced to watch a couple as they gnaw on fried chicken. One of the most taboo scenes takes place when a concupiscent teen masturbates to the Chesty Morgan soft-porn spy movie "Deadly Weapons." Chesty is determined to kill the dastards who killed her man so she smothers them with her ponderous breasts.

    SERIAL MOM is one of my all-time favourite black comedies, a genre that's notoriously difficult to get right (I mean, seriously, how many good ones can you think of?). I'm no fan of John Waters - in fact, this is the only film of his I've ever seen - but in this he has created pretty much the perfect antidote to the psycho-thriller genre. Kathleen Turner bags the role of a lifetime as Beverly R. Sutphin, a seemingly ordinary housewife with a sinister side: she bumps off anybody who crosses her. Add in a quirky family (young 'uns Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard are both particularly funny) and you have the scene set for plenty of unusual and unexpected laughs. The murder scene set to ANNIE is by far my favourite moment and one of the funniest things I've ever seen. What I like most about SERIAL MOM is the plot. In lesser hands, Turner would have successfully covered up her murders for the film's duration. Not so here - she's discovered, and becomes an unlikely celebrity, basking in her new-found fame. This gives Waters plenty of opportunity for satirising American law and order, fame, celebrity as well as suburban life and the nuclear family. DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES may satirise those kinds of things these days, but SERIAL MOM got there first!

    If it hadn't combined Kathleen Turner's amazingly over-the-top acting skills and John Waters' genius writing, Serial Mom would've been lost cause and a complete missed opportunity. Thankfully, both talents are used exquisitely and we get a pleasant turnout from one of the most daring and provocative filmmakers of our time. Using words like "exaggerated" and "unrealistic" to bash Serial Mom is like criticizing water for being colorless. It's supposed to be like that, and I don't think that registers with a lot of people. This is a difficult film for the public to swallow, but not for fans of Waters. He knows how to create a film from the ground up, and choose specific films that don't have blueprints to their name. He can make an original story, the problem just stems from marketing and MPAA agreement. He's lucky to be understood since his first film, or else, he'd be living the Babs Johnson lifestyle. The story revolves around Beverly Sutphin (Turner) a mom living with her husband and her son and daughter. The family resembles something of a Hallmark commercial, or even an ad for burgers or Sunny Delight. Everything is colorful, vibrant, and dripping with satire. Beverly is hiding that she is really a serial killer, hellbent on giving comeuppance to anyone who annoys her in the slightest way. Whether it be her kids' (Lake and Lillard) teachers, a short fused customer, or Mink Stole playing the perfect nervous neighbor, Beverly will find a way to get even with them. Serial Mom doesn't take itself seriously, and knows exactly what it is; a silly satire built on top of cutesy characters who couldn't possibly do anything wrong. The family is almost perfect, with the exception of Sam Waterson as Beverly's husband who seems he was never let in on the joke of this being a satire. Mink Stole, like stated before, is wonderful and wickedly vulgar much like her performance in Waters' trash film Pink Flamingos. This could also be established as Waters' second stab at the mainstream market with the first being Cry Baby. This is when Waters started to loosen his grip on the trash element of his films and focused on making more appealing films, but still incorporating his unique spin on things. If anything, I commend him for changing his style (we can't all stay hooked on perversions and sick characters to make films can we?) I recently watched and reviewed Waters' tour titled This Filthy World where Waters went film by film discussing the fun and hard times he encountered which each one. When talking about Serial Mom he concluded "it was a movie about how much fun it would be to kill people and get away it." Serial Mom understands that statement impeccably because we've all had that sick, sadistic desire to just kill someone who is just aggravating us or simply doesn't know what they're doing. Haven't we? Or am I just a sadist? Starring: Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard, and Mink Stole. Directed by: John Waters.

    Admit it. You know you have wanted to blow away that jerk who plays his music too loud, or the one who doesn't even begin to reach into her purse until the cashier has rung up all her groceries. Well, Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) doesn't just think about it, she takes action. Soccer mom by day, and serial killer by night. Only the mind of John Waters can come up with a perfect combination of gross and funny. The Sutphin family also includes Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard). Turner gives a highly underrated performance in a film that humorously exposes the culture of violence in which we all live.

    Kathleen Turner is hilarious as a mass murderess in director John Water's "Serial Mom" about a housewife who embarks on a homicidal rampage in Baltimore, Maryland. This wonderfully subversive black comedy depicts an apparently PTA mom who begins swapping flies and then graduates to cold-blooded murder. As Beverly Sutphin, Turner kills anybody who offends her dentist husband, gorehound movie buff son, and her hopeless romantic daughter. Nevertheless, Bev is pretty far gone before the spree unspools. The police are canvassing the neighborhood for an obscene caller initially when they poke their inquisitive noses in at Beverly's house. Waters ridicules everything from gory exploitation movies to culinary habits. Nobody escapes notice in this outrageous laugh riot except perhaps gay people. Beverly racks up seven murders to her credit, killing her victims with everything from a knife to a leg of lamb to a toppled air conditioner. Interestingly, Beverly's last victim is none other than Patty Hearst. Throughout it all, Turner similes and slays. Ultimately, of course, our leading lady is charged with murder and lands in court where she dismisses her attorney and conducts her defense. "Serial Mom" is such a bright, shiny, polished epic that it is difficult to believe that it is so bloodthirsty. Mind you, the language gets rather profane at times. Lots of pop culture references spring up, ranging from Suzanne Somers to Bill Cosby movies. Despite all the carefree blood and gore, the most agonizing scene occurs when we are forced to watch a couple as they gnaw on fried chicken. One of the most taboo scenes takes place when a concupiscent teen masturbates to the Chesty Morgan soft-porn spy movie "Deadly Weapons." Chesty is determined to kill the dastards who killed her man so she smothers them with her ponderous breasts.

    SERIAL MOM is one of my all-time favourite black comedies, a genre that's notoriously difficult to get right (I mean, seriously, how many good ones can you think of?). I'm no fan of John Waters - in fact, this is the only film of his I've ever seen - but in this he has created pretty much the perfect antidote to the psycho-thriller genre. Kathleen Turner bags the role of a lifetime as Beverly R. Sutphin, a seemingly ordinary housewife with a sinister side: she bumps off anybody who crosses her. Add in a quirky family (young 'uns Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard are both particularly funny) and you have the scene set for plenty of unusual and unexpected laughs. The murder scene set to ANNIE is by far my favourite moment and one of the funniest things I've ever seen. What I like most about SERIAL MOM is the plot. In lesser hands, Turner would have successfully covered up her murders for the film's duration. Not so here - she's discovered, and becomes an unlikely celebrity, basking in her new-found fame. This gives Waters plenty of opportunity for satirising American law and order, fame, celebrity as well as suburban life and the nuclear family. DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES may satirise those kinds of things these days, but SERIAL MOM got there first!

    If it hadn't combined Kathleen Turner's amazingly over-the-top acting skills and John Waters' genius writing, Serial Mom would've been lost cause and a complete missed opportunity. Thankfully, both talents are used exquisitely and we get a pleasant turnout from one of the most daring and provocative filmmakers of our time. Using words like "exaggerated" and "unrealistic" to bash Serial Mom is like criticizing water for being colorless. It's supposed to be like that, and I don't think that registers with a lot of people. This is a difficult film for the public to swallow, but not for fans of Waters. He knows how to create a film from the ground up, and choose specific films that don't have blueprints to their name. He can make an original story, the problem just stems from marketing and MPAA agreement. He's lucky to be understood since his first film, or else, he'd be living the Babs Johnson lifestyle. The story revolves around Beverly Sutphin (Turner) a mom living with her husband and her son and daughter. The family resembles something of a Hallmark commercial, or even an ad for burgers or Sunny Delight. Everything is colorful, vibrant, and dripping with satire. Beverly is hiding that she is really a serial killer, hellbent on giving comeuppance to anyone who annoys her in the slightest way. Whether it be her kids' (Lake and Lillard) teachers, a short fused customer, or Mink Stole playing the perfect nervous neighbor, Beverly will find a way to get even with them. Serial Mom doesn't take itself seriously, and knows exactly what it is; a silly satire built on top of cutesy characters who couldn't possibly do anything wrong. The family is almost perfect, with the exception of Sam Waterson as Beverly's husband who seems he was never let in on the joke of this being a satire. Mink Stole, like stated before, is wonderful and wickedly vulgar much like her performance in Waters' trash film Pink Flamingos. This could also be established as Waters' second stab at the mainstream market with the first being Cry Baby. This is when Waters started to loosen his grip on the trash element of his films and focused on making more appealing films, but still incorporating his unique spin on things. If anything, I commend him for changing his style (we can't all stay hooked on perversions and sick characters to make films can we?) I recently watched and reviewed Waters' tour titled This Filthy World where Waters went film by film discussing the fun and hard times he encountered which each one. When talking about Serial Mom he concluded "it was a movie about how much fun it would be to kill people and get away it." Serial Mom understands that statement impeccably because we've all had that sick, sadistic desire to just kill someone who is just aggravating us or simply doesn't know what they're doing. Haven't we? Or am I just a sadist? Starring: Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard, and Mink Stole. Directed by: John Waters.

    Admit it. You know you have wanted to blow away that jerk who plays his music too loud, or the one who doesn't even begin to reach into her purse until the cashier has rung up all her groceries. Well, Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) doesn't just think about it, she takes action. Soccer mom by day, and serial killer by night. Only the mind of John Waters can come up with a perfect combination of gross and funny. The Sutphin family also includes Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard). Turner gives a highly underrated performance in a film that humorously exposes the culture of violence in which we all live.

    Uncreative, absurd plot, poorly shot, ridiculous acting and, above all, tremendously unfunny! I'm an easy going person and, still, this movie was a torture to watch. I would actually have stopped watching it after 15 or 20 minutes but, since reviews had been kind of okay, I kept at it hoping the movie would improve. Unfortunately it only got worse with every passing minute. And please don't think I "simply didn't get it". I fully understood the supposed satire Waters was trying to produce. It simply didn't work. Watching this film was a complete waste of my time, except for the fact that it will keep me away from any other Waters movies.

    I wasn't familiar with director John Waters or dark/black humor-except the Addams Family movies. But since 1993 to the present, I've familiarized myself w/ a lot more. For starters, this was my first movie by JW and one of the first with Kathleen Turner. I first watched this at age 13, so needless to say, I was rather naive then. I've owned it on VHS, DVD(both editions) so obviously, it's one of my favorites. Along with Kathleen Turner, it also stars Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard as their adult kids, and Sam Waterston as a rather goofy husband. Most of the murders look so goofy, you can't possibly take this seriously, but maybe that was the point. Plus, her killing motives are goofy, not to mention ridiculous, although most involved slander of her family, subtle or major. Even after (finally) seeing Pink Flamingos- funny but gross) Cecil B. Demented-talk about bizarre) Cry-baby-some good musical numbers, both versions of Hairspray-both fairly enjoyable to me, and lastly, Pecker is probably my least favorite, Serial Mom remains my all-time favorite John Waters movie, to this day.

    Kathleen Turner rocks the house and her neighborhood as the picture-perfect mom who takes matters into her own hands to correct behaviors she considers bad manners. And if murder is the method in which she either corrects these behaviors (or simply eliminates them altogether), that's just too bad, because like fellow John Waters heroine Edna Turnblad ("Hairspray"), her diet pill is wearing off, and like Francine Fishpaw of "Polyester", she just can't take any more heartbreak! Imagine if Divine had lived long enough to do this movie. The obese drag queen would have added a grotesque image to the character of Beverly Sutphin, suburban Baltimore wife and mother who doesn't allow her children to use "the brown word", has a police officer remove the gum he's chewing, and treats her hard-working garbage men to mini-bottles as she comments on neighbor Mary Catlett's refusal to recycle. Then, there's the "Annie" watching video store customer of her son's who refuses to rewind (taken care of deliciously to the song "Tomorrow", much like the art patron bludgeoned in "A Clockwork Orange" to "Singin' in the Rain"), the math teacher who considers her son a wastrel, and the patient of her dentist husband who upsets her even more as she plots his and his wife's demise by eating cute Cornish hens. Taking care of all of these ne'er-do-wells (in her mind) is Kathleen Turner at her most beautiful, her husky voice perfectly suited to an obscene phone call to obnoxious neighbor Mink Stole, and deliciously rubbing it in later on in an extremely funny court scene where she wins over one witness by doing a "Basic Instinct" Sharon Stone impression for him. She also gets to visit a men's bathroom in a hysterically gross sequence where she takes care of daughter Rikki Lake's boyfriend who has dumped her for none other than Tracy Lords. Sound like another visit to Stepford? This is one woman who hasn't been robotized for her man (Sam Waterston), even though she goes out of her way to please him much to her children's discomfort. Turner rocks in this film, and while it definitely continues her "camp" quotient, it also as a "quote quotient" of hysterically funny memorable lines that have ended up as sketches in various drag shows across the country. John Waters adds just enough bad taste to keep the film amusing throughout, and you will not soon forget it. In fact, you may find yourself watching the film over just as soon as you've finished it to make sure you didn't miss anything the first time!

    Beverly Sutphin seems to be the perfect Baltimore housewife; she cares for her family, does the recycling, she even likes the birds that come to her gardenshe is also a killer! To begin with her crimes were limited to making obscene phone calls to one of her neighbours but when one of her son's teachers says he thinks he needs psychiatric help because of the violent pictures he draws... he has to go. The police are soon suspicious but there is no firm evidence. Soon she strikes again; killing the boy who dumped her daughter. With the police following her it looks as though she won't be able to kill again but she soon does. By the time she is finally arrested six people have died at her hands! Her family are obviously somewhat disturbed by it all but that doesn't stop her son and his friend Birdie helping her escape at one point. Once caught she is put on trial and with all the evidence there is no way she will get off is there? This is a difficult film to categorise; on the one hand the comedy it delivered with a light touch on the other the subject matter is dark and there is plenty to offend those who are bothered by swearing or violence. Kathleen Turner is great as the psychotic 'perfect mother'; I loved how her character was willing to murder but couldn't tolerate the slightest social faux pas. While it is very much her movie she is ably supported by Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard and Patricia Dunnock amongst others. The violence isn't too gory; in fact the way it is portrayed is fairly funny in a bad taste sort of way! After the murders things get even funnier when Beverly is put on trial; she hilariously discredits each of the witnesses in a way that could only work in a comedy such as this. I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who wants a good laugh but isn't easily offended.

    Can we safely say that if John Waters' name wasn't plaster all over this thing, it wouldn't have gotten half as many good reviews as it did. I feel as if people like his movies BECAUSE they're so terrible. It's not the subject matter that is a turn off to me, it's that John Waters doesn't know how to write. Good grief, can we take an unbiased look at the film and point out how God awful the dialogue is? Who the hell says "You bring me such peace" during sex? The characters in crappy movies like this one. The plot is so contrived. How did she know her victim would stop running long enough for her to drop an AC on him. Everything just happens to fit into place for the main character. There are so many things that are just awkwardly unrealistic. Of course, if you're being chased by a murderous woman, you're OBVIOUSLY gonna wanna try to hide in a venue that for some strange reason is having band play at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. Id say that since the 20th anniversary of Serial Mom is coming up, we should all celebrate by pretending this turd was never pushed out.

    This mainstream effort from the great cult director John Waters is a blackly hilarious treat, taking satirical jabs at suburbia, family life, and the celebrity treatment often afforded real life criminals. Kathleen Turner shines in one of her best roles as Beverly Sutphin, a beaming suburban mom with a loyal dentist husband (Sam Waterston), a lonely daughter (Ricki Lake), and a horror genre obsessed son (Matthew Lillard, warming up for his not dissimilar role in "Scream"). The trouble is, Beverly is easily annoyed, and any person who offends her sets of values or threatens the sanctity of her family will find their time to be extremely short. Eventually, she's caught, and her trial is turned into something of a circus, with tie in products being peddled such as a book adaptation and T-shirts. The portrayal of the way that killers can become a part of the popular culture is really spot on. "Serial Mom" goes so far as to make a point of the inevitable made for TV version of the events, with Suzanne Somers, doing a cameo as herself, tapped to play Beverly and hanging around as the trial unfolds. The delightful tongue in cheek approach shows how people start rallying around Serial Mom and find the actions of those she hates - such as not recycling - much more heinous than anything she does. Waters's wicked sense of humour is just great, especially when he has a victim bludgeoned with a leg of lamb while the song "Tomorrow" from the 1982 film version of "Annnie" serves as accompaniment. Waters has fun with his methods of murder, not taking them too seriously and not having any two alike; as a result, there's not much in the way of gore. (Although there is one priceless darkly comedic gag when it comes to the heart of one victim.) Waters maintains a likably self referential approach, and clips from movies such as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", "Blood Feast", and "Double Agent 73" show on screen, making this movie a treat to watch for cult film fans. The acting is enjoyable, from Waters regulars such as Mink Stole, Patricia Hearst, and Traci Lords, with Patricia Dunnock a delight as Lillard's gal pal. The movie has good energy, maintaining a nice off the wall sensibility from start to finish. It's just too hard to resist. Eight out of 10.

The police are soon suspicious but there is no firm evidence. Soon she strikes again; killing the boy who dumped her daughter. With the police following her it looks as though she won't be able to kill again but she soon does. By the time she is finally arrested six people have died at her hands! Her family are obviously somewhat disturbed by it all but that doesn't stop her son and his friend Birdie helping her escape at one point. Once caught she is put on trial and with all the evidence there is no way she will get off is there? This is a difficult film to categorise; on the one hand the comedy it delivered with a light touch on the other the subject matter is dark and there is plenty to offend those who are bothered by swearing or violence. Kathleen Turner is great as the psychotic 'perfect mother'; I loved how her character was willing to murder but couldn't tolerate the slightest social faux pas. While it is very much her movie she is ably supported by Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard and Patricia Dunnock amongst others. The violence isn't too gory; in fact the way it is portrayed is fairly funny in a bad taste sort of way! After the murders things get even funnier when Beverly is put on trial; she hilariously discredits each of the witnesses in a way that could only work in a comedy such as this. I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who wants a good laugh but isn't easily offended.

    Can we safely say that if John Waters' name wasn't plaster all over this thing, it wouldn't have gotten half as many good reviews as it did. I feel as if people like his movies BECAUSE they're so terrible. It's not the subject matter that is a turn off to me, it's that John Waters doesn't know how to write. Good grief, can we take an unbiased look at the film and point out how God awful the dialogue is? Who the hell says "You bring me such peace" during sex? The characters in crappy movies like this one. The plot is so contrived. How did she know her victim would stop running long enough for her to drop an AC on him. Everything just happens to fit into place for the main character. There are so many things that are just awkwardly unrealistic. Of course, if you're being chased by a murderous woman, you're OBVIOUSLY gonna wanna try to hide in a venue that for some strange reason is having band play at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. Id say that since the 20th anniversary of Serial Mom is coming up, we should all celebrate by pretending this turd was never pushed out.

    This mainstream effort from the great cult director John Waters is a blackly hilarious treat, taking satirical jabs at suburbia, family life, and the celebrity treatment often afforded real life criminals. Kathleen Turner shines in one of her best roles as Beverly Sutphin, a beaming suburban mom with a loyal dentist husband (Sam Waterston), a lonely daughter (Ricki Lake), and a horror genre obsessed son (Matthew Lillard, warming up for his not dissimilar role in "Scream"). The trouble is, Beverly is easily annoyed, and any person who offends her sets of values or threatens the sanctity of her family will find their time to be extremely short. Eventually, she's caught, and her trial is turned into something of a circus, with tie in products being peddled such as a book adaptation and T-shirts. The portrayal of the way that killers can become a part of the popular culture is really spot on. "Serial Mom" goes so far as to make a point of the inevitable made for TV version of the events, with Suzanne Somers, doing a cameo as herself, tapped to play Beverly and hanging around as the trial unfolds. The delightful tongue in cheek approach shows how people start rallying around Serial Mom and find the actions of those she hates - such as not recycling - much more heinous than anything she does. Waters's wicked sense of humour is just great, especially when he has a victim bludgeoned with a leg of lamb while the song "Tomorrow" from the 1982 film version of "Annnie" serves as accompaniment. Waters has fun with his methods of murder, not taking them too seriously and not having any two alike; as a result, there's not much in the way of gore. (Although there is one priceless darkly comedic gag when it comes to the heart of one victim.) Waters maintains a likably self referential approach, and clips from movies such as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", "Blood Feast", and "Double Agent 73" show on screen, making this movie a treat to watch for cult film fans. The acting is enjoyable, from Waters regulars such as Mink Stole, Patricia Hearst, and Traci Lords, with Patricia Dunnock a delight as Lillard's gal pal. The movie has good energy, maintaining a nice off the wall sensibility from start to finish. It's just too hard to resist. Eight out of 10.

    Kathleen Turner is hilarious as a mass murderess in director John Water's "Serial Mom" about a housewife who embarks on a homicidal rampage in Baltimore, Maryland. This wonderfully subversive black comedy depicts an apparently PTA mom who begins swapping flies and then graduates to cold-blooded murder. As Beverly Sutphin, Turner kills anybody who offends her dentist husband, gorehound movie buff son, and her hopeless romantic daughter. Nevertheless, Bev is pretty far gone before the spree unspools. The police are canvassing the neighborhood for an obscene caller initially when they poke their inquisitive noses in at Beverly's house. Waters ridicules everything from gory exploitation movies to culinary habits. Nobody escapes notice in this outrageous laugh riot except perhaps gay people. Beverly racks up seven murders to her credit, killing her victims with everything from a knife to a leg of lamb to a toppled air conditioner. Interestingly, Beverly's last victim is none other than Patty Hearst. Throughout it all, Turner similes and slays. Ultimately, of course, our leading lady is charged with murder and lands in court where she dismisses her attorney and conducts her defense. "Serial Mom" is such a bright, shiny, polished epic that it is difficult to believe that it is so bloodthirsty. Mind you, the language gets rather profane at times. Lots of pop culture references spring up, ranging from Suzanne Somers to Bill Cosby movies. Despite all the carefree blood and gore, the most agonizing scene occurs when we are forced to watch a couple as they gnaw on fried chicken. One of the most taboo scenes takes place when a concupiscent teen masturbates to the Chesty Morgan soft-porn spy movie "Deadly Weapons." Chesty is determined to kill the dastards who killed her man so she smothers them with her ponderous breasts.

    SERIAL MOM is one of my all-time favourite black comedies, a genre that's notoriously difficult to get right (I mean, seriously, how many good ones can you think of?). I'm no fan of John Waters - in fact, this is the only film of his I've ever seen - but in this he has created pretty much the perfect antidote to the psycho-thriller genre. Kathleen Turner bags the role of a lifetime as Beverly R. Sutphin, a seemingly ordinary housewife with a sinister side: she bumps off anybody who crosses her. Add in a quirky family (young 'uns Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard are both particularly funny) and you have the scene set for plenty of unusual and unexpected laughs. The murder scene set to ANNIE is by far my favourite moment and one of the funniest things I've ever seen. What I like most about SERIAL MOM is the plot. In lesser hands, Turner would have successfully covered up her murders for the film's duration. Not so here - she's discovered, and becomes an unlikely celebrity, basking in her new-found fame. This gives Waters plenty of opportunity for satirising American law and order, fame, celebrity as well as suburban life and the nuclear family. DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES may satirise those kinds of things these days, but SERIAL MOM got there first!

    If it hadn't combined Kathleen Turner's amazingly over-the-top acting skills and John Waters' genius writing, Serial Mom would've been lost cause and a complete missed opportunity. Thankfully, both talents are used exquisitely and we get a pleasant turnout from one of the most daring and provocative filmmakers of our time. Using words like "exaggerated" and "unrealistic" to bash Serial Mom is like criticizing water for being colorless. It's supposed to be like that, and I don't think that registers with a lot of people. This is a difficult film for the public to swallow, but not for fans of Waters. He knows how to create a film from the ground up, and choose specific films that don't have blueprints to their name. He can make an original story, the problem just stems from marketing and MPAA agreement. He's lucky to be understood since his first film, or else, he'd be living the Babs Johnson lifestyle. The story revolves around Beverly Sutphin (Turner) a mom living with her husband and her son and daughter. The family resembles something of a Hallmark commercial, or even an ad for burgers or Sunny Delight. Everything is colorful, vibrant, and dripping with satire. Beverly is hiding that she is really a serial killer, hellbent on giving comeuppance to anyone who annoys her in the slightest way. Whether it be her kids' (Lake and Lillard) teachers, a short fused customer, or Mink Stole playing the perfect nervous neighbor, Beverly will find a way to get even with them. Serial Mom doesn't take itself seriously, and knows exactly what it is; a silly satire built on top of cutesy characters who couldn't possibly do anything wrong. The family is almost perfect, with the exception of Sam Waterson as Beverly's husband who seems he was never let in on the joke of this being a satire. Mink Stole, like stated before, is wonderful and wickedly vulgar much like her performance in Waters' trash film Pink Flamingos. This could also be established as Waters' second stab at the mainstream market with the first being Cry Baby. This is when Waters started to loosen his grip on the trash element of his films and focused on making more appealing films, but still incorporating his unique spin on things. If anything, I commend him for changing his style (we can't all stay hooked on perversions and sick characters to make films can we?) I recently watched and reviewed Waters' tour titled This Filthy World where Waters went film by film discussing the fun and hard times he encountered which each one. When talking about Serial Mom he concluded "it was a movie about how much fun it would be to kill people and get away it." Serial Mom understands that statement impeccably because we've all had that sick, sadistic desire to just kill someone who is just aggravating us or simply doesn't know what they're doing. Haven't we? Or am I just a sadist? Starring: Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard, and Mink Stole. Directed by: John Waters.

    Admit it. You know you have wanted to blow away that jerk who plays his music too loud, or the one who doesn't even begin to reach into her purse until the cashier has rung up all her groceries. Well, Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) doesn't just think about it, she takes action. Soccer mom by day, and serial killer by night. Only the mind of John Waters can come up with a perfect combination of gross and funny. The Sutphin family also includes Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard). Turner gives a highly underrated performance in a film that humorously exposes the culture of violence in which we all live.

    Uncreative, absurd plot, poorly shot, ridiculous acting and, above all, tremendously unfunny! I'm an easy going person and, still, this movie was a torture to watch. I would actually have stopped watching it after 15 or 20 minutes but, since reviews had been kind of okay, I kept at it hoping the movie would improve. Unfortunately it only got worse with every passing minute. And please don't think I "simply didn't get it". I fully understood the supposed satire Waters was trying to produce. It simply didn't work. Watching this film was a complete waste of my time, except for the fact that it will keep me away from any other Waters movies.

    I wasn't familiar with director John Waters or dark/black humor-except the Addams Family movies. But since 1993 to the present, I've familiarized myself w/ a lot more. For starters, this was my first movie by JW and one of the first with Kathleen Turner. I first watched this at age 13, so needless to say, I was rather naive then. I've owned it on VHS, DVD(both editions) so obviously, it's one of my favorites. Along with Kathleen Turner, it also stars Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard as their adult kids, and Sam Waterston as a rather goofy husband. Most of the murders look so goofy, you can't possibly take this seriously, but maybe that was the point. Plus, her killing motives are goofy, not to mention ridiculous, although most involved slander of her family, subtle or major. Even after (finally) seeing Pink Flamingos- funny but gross) Cecil B. Demented-talk about bizarre) Cry-baby-some good musical numbers, both versions of Hairspray-both fairly enjoyable to me, and lastly, Pecker is probably my least favorite, Serial Mom remains my all-time favorite John Waters movie, to this day.

    Kathleen Turner rocks the house and her neighborhood as the picture-perfect mom who takes matters into her own hands to correct behaviors she considers bad manners. And if murder is the method in which she either corrects these behaviors (or simply eliminates them altogether), that's just too bad, because like fellow John Waters heroine Edna Turnblad ("Hairspray"), her diet pill is wearing off, and like Francine Fishpaw of "Polyester", she just can't take any more heartbreak! Imagine if Divine had lived long enough to do this movie. The obese drag queen would have added a grotesque image to the character of Beverly Sutphin, suburban Baltimore wife and mother who doesn't allow her children to use "the brown word", has a police officer remove the gum he's chewing, and treats her hard-working garbage men to mini-bottles as she comments on neighbor Mary Catlett's refusal to recycle. Then, there's the "Annie" watching video store customer of her son's who refuses to rewind (taken care of deliciously to the song "Tomorrow", much like the art patron bludgeoned in "A Clockwork Orange" to "Singin' in the Rain"), the math teacher who considers her son a wastrel, and the patient of her dentist husband who upsets her even more as she plots his and his wife's demise by eating cute Cornish hens. Taking care of all of these ne'er-do-wells (in her mind) is Kathleen Turner at her most beautiful, her husky voice perfectly suited to an obscene phone call to obnoxious neighbor Mink Stole, and deliciously rubbing it in later on in an extremely funny court scene where she wins over one witness by doing a "Basic Instinct" Sharon Stone impression for him. She also gets to visit a men's bathroom in a hysterically gross sequence where she takes care of daughter Rikki Lake's boyfriend who has dumped her for none other than Tracy Lords. Sound like another visit to Stepford? This is one woman who hasn't been robotized for her man (Sam Waterston), even though she goes out of her way to please him much to her children's discomfort. Turner rocks in this film, and while it definitely continues her "camp" quotient, it also as a "quote quotient" of hysterically funny memorable lines that have ended up as sketches in various drag shows across the country. John Waters adds just enough bad taste to keep the film amusing throughout, and you will not soon forget it. In fact, you may find yourself watching the film over just as soon as you've finished it to make sure you didn't miss anything the first time!

    Beverly Sutphin seems to be the perfect Baltimore housewife; she cares for her family, does the recycling, she even likes the birds that come to her gardenshe is also a killer! To begin with her crimes were limited to making obscene phone calls to one of her neighbours but when one of her son's teachers says he thinks he needs psychiatric help because of the violent pictures he draws... he has to go. The police are soon suspicious but there is no firm evidence. Soon she strikes again; killing the boy who dumped her daughter.

    Uncreative, absurd plot, poorly shot, ridiculous acting and, above all, tremendously unfunny! I'm an easy going person and, still, this movie was a torture to watch. I would actually have stopped watching it after 15 or 20 minutes but, since reviews had been kind of okay, I kept at it hoping the movie would improve. Unfortunately it only got worse with every passing minute. And please don't think I "simply didn't get it". I fully understood the supposed satire Waters was trying to produce. It simply didn't work. Watching this film was a complete waste of my time, except for the fact that it will keep me away from any other Waters movies.

    I wasn't familiar with director John Waters or dark/black humor-except the Addams Family movies. But since 1993 to the present, I've familiarized myself w/ a lot more. For starters, this was my first movie by JW and one of the first with Kathleen Turner. I first watched this at age 13, so needless to say, I was rather naive then. I've owned it on VHS, DVD(both editions) so obviously, it's one of my favorites. Along with Kathleen Turner, it also stars Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard as their adult kids, and Sam Waterston as a rather goofy husband. Most of the murders look so goofy, you can't possibly take this seriously, but maybe that was the point. Plus, her killing motives are goofy, not to mention ridiculous, although most involved slander of her family, subtle or major. Even after (finally) seeing Pink Flamingos- funny but gross) Cecil B. Demented-talk about bizarre) Cry-baby-some good musical numbers, both versions of Hairspray-both fairly enjoyable to me, and lastly, Pecker is probably my least favorite, Serial Mom remains my all-time favorite John Waters movie, to this day.

    Kathleen Turner rocks the house and her neighborhood as the picture-perfect mom who takes matters into her own hands to correct behaviors she considers bad manners. And if murder is the method in which she either corrects these behaviors (or simply eliminates them altogether), that's just too bad, because like fellow John Waters heroine Edna Turnblad ("Hairspray"), her diet pill is wearing off, and like Francine Fishpaw of "Polyester", she just can't take any more heartbreak! Imagine if Divine had lived long enough to do this movie. The obese drag queen would have added a grotesque image to the character of Beverly Sutphin, suburban Baltimore wife and mother who doesn't allow her children to use "the brown word", has a police officer remove the gum he's chewing, and treats her hard-working garbage men to mini-bottles as she comments on neighbor Mary Catlett's refusal to recycle. Then, there's the "Annie" watching video store customer of her son's who refuses to rewind (taken care of deliciously to the song "Tomorrow", much like the art patron bludgeoned in "A Clockwork Orange" to "Singin' in the Rain"), the math teacher who considers her son a wastrel, and the patient of her dentist husband who upsets her even more as she plots his and his wife's demise by eating cute Cornish hens. Taking care of all of these ne'er-do-wells (in her mind) is Kathleen Turner at her most beautiful, her husky voice perfectly suited to an obscene phone call to obnoxious neighbor Mink Stole, and deliciously rubbing it in later on in an extremely funny court scene where she wins over one witness by doing a "Basic Instinct" Sharon Stone impression for him. She also gets to visit a men's bathroom in a hysterically gross sequence where she takes care of daughter Rikki Lake's boyfriend who has dumped her for none other than Tracy Lords. Sound like another visit to Stepford? This is one woman who hasn't been robotized for her man (Sam Waterston), even though she goes out of her way to please him much to her children's discomfort. Turner rocks in this film, and while it definitely continues her "camp" quotient, it also as a "quote quotient" of hysterically funny memorable lines that have ended up as sketches in various drag shows across the country. John Waters adds just enough bad taste to keep the film amusing throughout, and you will not soon forget it. In fact, you may find yourself watching the film over just as soon as you've finished it to make sure you didn't miss anything the first time!

    Beverly Sutphin seems to be the perfect Baltimore housewife; she cares for her family, does the recycling, she even likes the birds that come to her gardenshe is also a killer! To begin with her crimes were limited to making obscene phone calls to one of her neighbours but when one of her son's teachers says he thinks he needs psychiatric help because of the violent pictures he draws... he has to go. The police are soon suspicious but there is no firm evidence. Soon she strikes again; killing the boy who dumped her daughter. With the police following her it looks as though she won't be able to kill again but she soon does. By the time she is finally arrested six people have died at her hands! Her family are obviously somewhat disturbed by it all but that doesn't stop her son and his friend Birdie helping her escape at one point. Once caught she is put on trial and with all the evidence there is no way she will get off is there? This is a difficult film to categorise; on the one hand the comedy it delivered with a light touch on the other the subject matter is dark and there is plenty to offend those who are bothered by swearing or violence. Kathleen Turner is great as the psychotic 'perfect mother'; I loved how her character was willing to murder but couldn't tolerate the slightest social faux pas. While it is very much her movie she is ably supported by Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard and Patricia Dunnock amongst others. The violence isn't too gory; in fact the way it is portrayed is fairly funny in a bad taste sort of way! After the murders things get even funnier when Beverly is put on trial; she hilariously discredits each of the witnesses in a way that could only work in a comedy such as this. I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who wants a good laugh but isn't easily offended.

    Can we safely say that if John Waters' name wasn't plaster all over this thing, it wouldn't have gotten half as many good reviews as it did. I feel as if people like his movies BECAUSE they're so terrible. It's not the subject matter that is a turn off to me, it's that John Waters doesn't know how to write. Good grief, can we take an unbiased look at the film and point out how God awful the dialogue is? Who the hell says "You bring me such peace" during sex? The characters in crappy movies like this one. The plot is so contrived. How did she know her victim would stop running long enough for her to drop an AC on him. Everything just happens to fit into place for the main character. There are so many things that are just awkwardly unrealistic. Of course, if you're being chased by a murderous woman, you're OBVIOUSLY gonna wanna try to hide in a venue that for some strange reason is having band play at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. Id say that since the 20th anniversary of Serial Mom is coming up, we should all celebrate by pretending this turd was never pushed out.

    This mainstream effort from the great cult director John Waters is a blackly hilarious treat, taking satirical jabs at suburbia, family life, and the celebrity treatment often afforded real life criminals. Kathleen Turner shines in one of her best roles as Beverly Sutphin, a beaming suburban mom with a loyal dentist husband (Sam Waterston), a lonely daughter (Ricki Lake), and a horror genre obsessed son (Matthew Lillard, warming up for his not dissimilar role in "Scream"). The trouble is, Beverly is easily annoyed, and any person who offends her sets of values or threatens the sanctity of her family will find their time to be extremely short. Eventually, she's caught, and her trial is turned into something of a circus, with tie in products being peddled such as a book adaptation and T-shirts. The portrayal of the way that killers can become a part of the popular culture is really spot on. "Serial Mom" goes so far as to make a point of the inevitable made for TV version of the events, with Suzanne Somers, doing a cameo as herself, tapped to play Beverly and hanging around as the trial unfolds. The delightful tongue in cheek approach shows how people start rallying around Serial Mom and find the actions of those she hates - such as not recycling - much more heinous than anything she does. Waters's wicked sense of humour is just great, especially when he has a victim bludgeoned with a leg of lamb while the song "Tomorrow" from the 1982 film version of "Annnie" serves as accompaniment. Waters has fun with his methods of murder, not taking them too seriously and not having any two alike; as a result, there's not much in the way of gore. (Although there is one priceless darkly comedic gag when it comes to the heart of one victim.) Waters maintains a likably self referential approach, and clips from movies such as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", "Blood Feast", and "Double Agent 73" show on screen, making this movie a treat to watch for cult film fans. The acting is enjoyable, from Waters regulars such as Mink Stole, Patricia Hearst, and Traci Lords, with Patricia Dunnock a delight as Lillard's gal pal. The movie has good energy, maintaining a nice off the wall sensibility from start to finish. It's just too hard to resist. Eight out of 10.

    Kathleen Turner is hilarious as a mass murderess in director John Water's "Serial Mom" about a housewife who embarks on a homicidal rampage in Baltimore, Maryland. This wonderfully subversive black comedy depicts an apparently PTA mom who begins swapping flies and then graduates to cold-blooded murder. As Beverly Sutphin, Turner kills anybody who offends her dentist husband, gorehound movie buff son, and her hopeless romantic daughter. Nevertheless, Bev is pretty far gone before the spree unspools. The police are canvassing the neighborhood for an obscene caller initially when they poke their inquisitive noses in at Beverly's house. Waters ridicules everything from gory exploitation movies to culinary habits. Nobody escapes notice in this outrageous laugh riot except perhaps gay people. Beverly racks up seven murders to her credit, killing her victims with everything from a knife to a leg of lamb to a toppled air conditioner. Interestingly, Beverly's last victim is none other than Patty Hearst. Throughout it all, Turner similes and slays. Ultimately, of course, our leading lady is charged with murder and lands in court where she dismisses her attorney and conducts her defense. "Serial Mom" is such a bright, shiny, polished epic that it is difficult to believe that it is so bloodthirsty. Mind you, the language gets rather profane at times. Lots of pop culture references spring up, ranging from Suzanne Somers to Bill Cosby movies. Despite all the carefree blood and gore, the most agonizing scene occurs when we are forced to watch a couple as they gnaw on fried chicken. One of the most taboo scenes takes place when a concupiscent teen masturbates to the Chesty Morgan soft-porn spy movie "Deadly Weapons." Chesty is determined to kill the dastards who killed her man so she smothers them with her ponderous breasts.

    SERIAL MOM is one of my all-time favourite black comedies, a genre that's notoriously difficult to get right (I mean, seriously, how many good ones can you think of?). I'm no fan of John Waters - in fact, this is the only film of his I've ever seen - but in this he has created pretty much the perfect antidote to the psycho-thriller genre. Kathleen Turner bags the role of a lifetime as Beverly R. Sutphin, a seemingly ordinary housewife with a sinister side: she bumps off anybody who crosses her. Add in a quirky family (young 'uns Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard are both particularly funny) and you have the scene set for plenty of unusual and unexpected laughs. The murder scene set to ANNIE is by far my favourite moment and one of the funniest things I've ever seen. What I like most about SERIAL MOM is the plot. In lesser hands, Turner would have successfully covered up her murders for the film's duration. Not so here - she's discovered, and becomes an unlikely celebrity, basking in her new-found fame. This gives Waters plenty of opportunity for satirising American law and order, fame, celebrity as well as suburban life and the nuclear family. DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES may satirise those kinds of things these days, but SERIAL MOM got there first!

    If it hadn't combined Kathleen Turner's amazingly over-the-top acting skills and John Waters' genius writing, Serial Mom would've been lost cause and a complete missed opportunity. Thankfully, both talents are used exquisitely and we get a pleasant turnout from one of the most daring and provocative filmmakers of our time. Using words like "exaggerated" and "unrealistic" to bash Serial Mom is like criticizing water for being colorless. It's supposed to be like that, and I don't think that registers with a lot of people. This is a difficult film for the public to swallow, but not for fans of Waters. He knows how to create a film from the ground up, and choose specific films that don't have blueprints to their name. He can make an original story, the problem just stems from marketing and MPAA agreement. He's lucky to be understood since his first film, or else, he'd be living the Babs Johnson lifestyle. The story revolves around Beverly Sutphin (Turner) a mom living with her husband and her son and daughter. The family resembles something of a Hallmark commercial, or even an ad for burgers or Sunny Delight. Everything is colorful, vibrant, and dripping with satire. Beverly is hiding that she is really a serial killer, hellbent on giving comeuppance to anyone who annoys her in the slightest way. Whether it be her kids' (Lake and Lillard) teachers, a short fused customer, or Mink Stole playing the perfect nervous neighbor, Beverly will find a way to get even with them. Serial Mom doesn't take itself seriously, and knows exactly what it is; a silly satire built on top of cutesy characters who couldn't possibly do anything wrong. The family is almost perfect, with the exception of Sam Waterson as Beverly's husband who seems he was never let in on the joke of this being a satire. Mink Stole, like stated before, is wonderful and wickedly vulgar much like her performance in Waters' trash film Pink Flamingos. This could also be established as Waters' second stab at the mainstream market with the first being Cry Baby. This is when Waters started to loosen his grip on the trash element of his films and focused on making more appealing films, but still incorporating his unique spin on things. If anything, I commend him for changing his style (we can't all stay hooked on perversions and sick characters to make films can we?) I recently watched and reviewed Waters' tour titled This Filthy World where Waters went film by film discussing the fun and hard times he encountered which each one. When talking about Serial Mom he concluded "it was a movie about how much fun it would be to kill people and get away it." Serial Mom understands that statement impeccably because we've all had that sick, sadistic desire to just kill someone who is just aggravating us or simply doesn't know what they're doing. Haven't we? Or am I just a sadist? Starring: Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard, and Mink Stole. Directed by: John Waters.

    Admit it. You know you have wanted to blow away that jerk who plays his music too loud, or the one who doesn't even begin to reach into her purse until the cashier has rung up all her groceries. Well, Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) doesn't just think about it, she takes action. Soccer mom by day, and serial killer by night. Only the mind of John Waters can come up with a perfect combination of gross and funny. The Sutphin family also includes Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard). Turner gives a highly underrated performance in a film that humorously exposes the culture of violence in which we all live.

    SERIAL MOM is one of my all-time favourite black comedies, a genre that's notoriously difficult to get right (I mean, seriously, how many good ones can you think of?). I'm no fan of John Waters - in fact, this is the only film of his I've ever seen - but in this he has created pretty much the perfect antidote to the psycho-thriller genre. Kathleen Turner bags the role of a lifetime as Beverly R. Sutphin, a seemingly ordinary housewife with a sinister side: she bumps off anybody who crosses her. Add in a quirky family (young 'uns Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard are both particularly funny) and you have the scene set for plenty of unusual and unexpected laughs. The murder scene set to ANNIE is by far my favourite moment and one of the funniest things I've ever seen. What I like most about SERIAL MOM is the plot. In lesser hands, Turner would have successfully covered up her murders for the film's duration. Not so here - she's discovered, and becomes an unlikely celebrity, basking in her new-found fame. This gives Waters plenty of opportunity for satirising American law and order, fame, celebrity as well as suburban life and the nuclear family. DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES may satirise those kinds of things these days, but SERIAL MOM got there first!

    If it hadn't combined Kathleen Turner's amazingly over-the-top acting skills and John Waters' genius writing, Serial Mom would've been lost cause and a complete missed opportunity. Thankfully, both talents are used exquisitely and we get a pleasant turnout from one of the most daring and provocative filmmakers of our time. Using words like "exaggerated" and "unrealistic" to bash Serial Mom is like criticizing water for being colorless. It's supposed to be like that, and I don't think that registers with a lot of people. This is a difficult film for the public to swallow, but not for fans of Waters. He knows how to create a film from the ground up, and choose specific films that don't have blueprints to their name. He can make an original story, the problem just stems from marketing and MPAA agreement. He's lucky to be understood since his first film, or else, he'd be living the Babs Johnson lifestyle. The story revolves around Beverly Sutphin (Turner) a mom living with her husband and her son and daughter. The family resembles something of a Hallmark commercial, or even an ad for burgers or Sunny Delight. Everything is colorful, vibrant, and dripping with satire. Beverly is hiding that she is really a serial killer, hellbent on giving comeuppance to anyone who annoys her in the slightest way. Whether it be her kids' (Lake and Lillard) teachers, a short fused customer, or Mink Stole playing the perfect nervous neighbor, Beverly will find a way to get even with them. Serial Mom doesn't take itself seriously, and knows exactly what it is; a silly satire built on top of cutesy characters who couldn't possibly do anything wrong. The family is almost perfect, with the exception of Sam Waterson as Beverly's husband who seems he was never let in on the joke of this being a satire. Mink Stole, like stated before, is wonderful and wickedly vulgar much like her performance in Waters' trash film Pink Flamingos. This could also be established as Waters' second stab at the mainstream market with the first being Cry Baby. This is when Waters started to loosen his grip on the trash element of his films and focused on making more appealing films, but still incorporating his unique spin on things. If anything, I commend him for changing his style (we can't all stay hooked on perversions and sick characters to make films can we?) I recently watched and reviewed Waters' tour titled This Filthy World where Waters went film by film discussing the fun and hard times he encountered which each one. When talking about Serial Mom he concluded "it was a movie about how much fun it would be to kill people and get away it." Serial Mom understands that statement impeccably because we've all had that sick, sadistic desire to just kill someone who is just aggravating us or simply doesn't know what they're doing. Haven't we? Or am I just a sadist? Starring: Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard, and Mink Stole. Directed by: John Waters.

    Admit it. You know you have wanted to blow away that jerk who plays his music too loud, or the one who doesn't even begin to reach into her purse until the cashier has rung up all her groceries. Well, Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) doesn't just think about it, she takes action. Soccer mom by day, and serial killer by night. Only the mind of John Waters can come up with a perfect combination of gross and funny. The Sutphin family also includes Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard). Turner gives a highly underrated performance in a film that humorously exposes the culture of violence in which we all live.

    Uncreative, absurd plot, poorly shot, ridiculous acting and, above all, tremendously unfunny! I'm an easy going person and, still, this movie was a torture to watch. I would actually have stopped watching it after 15 or 20 minutes but, since reviews had been kind of okay, I kept at it hoping the movie would improve. Unfortunately it only got worse with every passing minute. And please don't think I "simply didn't get it". I fully understood the supposed satire Waters was trying to produce. It simply didn't work. Watching this film was a complete waste of my time, except for the fact that it will keep me away from any other Waters movies.

    I wasn't familiar with director John Waters or dark/black humor-except the Addams Family movies. But since 1993 to the present, I've familiarized myself w/ a lot more. For starters, this was my first movie by JW and one of the first with Kathleen Turner. I first watched this at age 13, so needless to say, I was rather naive then. I've owned it on VHS, DVD(both editions) so obviously, it's one of my favorites. Along with Kathleen Turner, it also stars Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard as their adult kids, and Sam Waterston as a rather goofy husband. Most of the murders look so goofy, you can't possibly take this seriously, but maybe that was the point. Plus, her killing motives are goofy, not to mention ridiculous, although most involved slander of her family, subtle or major. Even after (finally) seeing Pink Flamingos- funny but gross) Cecil B. Demented-talk about bizarre) Cry-baby-some good musical numbers, both versions of Hairspray-both fairly enjoyable to me, and lastly, Pecker is probably my least favorite, Serial Mom remains my all-time favorite John Waters movie, to this day.

    Kathleen Turner rocks the house and her neighborhood as the picture-perfect mom who takes matters into her own hands to correct behaviors she considers bad manners. And if murder is the method in which she either corrects these behaviors (or simply eliminates them altogether), that's just too bad, because like fellow John Waters heroine Edna Turnblad ("Hairspray"), her diet pill is wearing off, and like Francine Fishpaw of "Polyester", she just can't take any more heartbreak! Imagine if Divine had lived long enough to do this movie. The obese drag queen would have added a grotesque image to the character of Beverly Sutphin, suburban Baltimore wife and mother who doesn't allow her children to use "the brown word", has a police officer remove the gum he's chewing, and treats her hard-working garbage men to mini-bottles as she comments on neighbor Mary Catlett's refusal to recycle. Then, there's the "Annie" watching video store customer of her son's who refuses to rewind (taken care of deliciously to the song "Tomorrow", much like the art patron bludgeoned in "A Clockwork Orange" to "Singin' in the Rain"), the math teacher who considers her son a wastrel, and the patient of her dentist husband who upsets her even more as she plots his and his wife's demise by eating cute Cornish hens. Taking care of all of these ne'er-do-wells (in her mind) is Kathleen Turner at her most beautiful, her husky voice perfectly suited to an obscene phone call to obnoxious neighbor Mink Stole, and deliciously rubbing it in later on in an extremely funny court scene where she wins over one witness by doing a "Basic Instinct" Sharon Stone impression for him. She also gets to visit a men's bathroom in a hysterically gross sequence where she takes care of daughter Rikki Lake's boyfriend who has dumped her for none other than Tracy Lords. Sound like another visit to Stepford? This is one woman who hasn't been robotized for her man (Sam Waterston), even though she goes out of her way to please him much to her children's discomfort. Turner rocks in this film, and while it definitely continues her "camp" quotient, it also as a "quote quotient" of hysterically funny memorable lines that have ended up as sketches in various drag shows across the country. John Waters adds just enough bad taste to keep the film amusing throughout, and you will not soon forget it. In fact, you may find yourself watching the film over just as soon as you've finished it to make sure you didn't miss anything the first time!

    Beverly Sutphin seems to be the perfect Baltimore housewife; she cares for her family, does the recycling, she even likes the birds that come to her gardenshe is also a killer! To begin with her crimes were limited to making obscene phone calls to one of her neighbours but when one of her son's teachers says he thinks he needs psychiatric help because of the violent pictures he draws... he has to go. The police are soon suspicious but there is no firm evidence. Soon she strikes again; killing the boy who dumped her daughter. With the police following her it looks as though she won't be able to kill again but she soon does. By the time she is finally arrested six people have died at her hands! Her family are obviously somewhat disturbed by it all but that doesn't stop her son and his friend Birdie helping her escape at one point. Once caught she is put on trial and with all the evidence there is no way she will get off is there? This is a difficult film to categorise; on the one hand the comedy it delivered with a light touch on the other the subject matter is dark and there is plenty to offend those who are bothered by swearing or violence. Kathleen Turner is great as the psychotic 'perfect mother'; I loved how her character was willing to murder but couldn't tolerate the slightest social faux pas. While it is very much her movie she is ably supported by Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard and Patricia Dunnock amongst others. The violence isn't too gory; in fact the way it is portrayed is fairly funny in a bad taste sort of way! After the murders things get even funnier when Beverly is put on trial; she hilariously discredits each of the witnesses in a way that could only work in a comedy such as this. I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who wants a good laugh but isn't easily offended.

    Can we safely say that if John Waters' name wasn't plaster all over this thing, it wouldn't have gotten half as many good reviews as it did. I feel as if people like his movies BECAUSE they're so terrible. It's not the subject matter that is a turn off to me, it's that John Waters doesn't know how to write. Good grief, can we take an unbiased look at the film and point out how God awful the dialogue is? Who the hell says "You bring me such peace" during sex? The characters in crappy movies like this one. The plot is so contrived. How did she know her victim would stop running long enough for her to drop an AC on him. Everything just happens to fit into place for the main character. There are so many things that are just awkwardly unrealistic. Of course, if you're being chased by a murderous woman, you're OBVIOUSLY gonna wanna try to hide in a venue that for some strange reason is having band play at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. Id say that since the 20th anniversary of Serial Mom is coming up, we should all celebrate by pretending this turd was never pushed out.

    This mainstream effort from the great cult director John Waters is a blackly hilarious treat, taking satirical jabs at suburbia, family life, and the celebrity treatment often afforded real life criminals. Kathleen Turner shines in one of her best roles as Beverly Sutphin, a beaming suburban mom with a loyal dentist husband (Sam Waterston), a lonely daughter (Ricki Lake), and a horror genre obsessed son (Matthew Lillard, warming up for his not dissimilar role in "Scream"). The trouble is, Beverly is easily annoyed, and any person who offends her sets of values or threatens the sanctity of her family will find their time to be extremely short. Eventually, she's caught, and her trial is turned into something of a circus, with tie in products being peddled such as a book adaptation and T-shirts. The portrayal of the way that killers can become a part of the popular culture is really spot on. "Serial Mom" goes so far as to make a point of the inevitable made for TV version of the events, with Suzanne Somers, doing a cameo as herself, tapped to play Beverly and hanging around as the trial unfolds. The delightful tongue in cheek approach shows how people start rallying around Serial Mom and find the actions of those she hates - such as not recycling - much more heinous than anything she does. Waters's wicked sense of humour is just great, especially when he has a victim bludgeoned with a leg of lamb while the song "Tomorrow" from the 1982 film version of "Annnie" serves as accompaniment. Waters has fun with his methods of murder, not taking them too seriously and not having any two alike; as a result, there's not much in the way of gore. (Although there is one priceless darkly comedic gag when it comes to the heart of one victim.) Waters maintains a likably self referential approach, and clips from movies such as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", "Blood Feast", and "Double Agent 73" show on screen, making this movie a treat to watch for cult film fans. The acting is enjoyable, from Waters regulars such as Mink Stole, Patricia Hearst, and Traci Lords, with Patricia Dunnock a delight as Lillard's gal pal. The movie has good energy, maintaining a nice off the wall sensibility from start to finish. It's just too hard to resist. Eight out of 10.

    Kathleen Turner is hilarious as a mass murderess in director John Water's "Serial Mom" about a housewife who embarks on a homicidal rampage in Baltimore, Maryland. This wonderfully subversive black comedy depicts an apparently PTA mom who begins swapping flies and then graduates to cold-blooded murder. As Beverly Sutphin, Turner kills anybody who offends her dentist husband, gorehound movie buff son, and her hopeless romantic daughter. Nevertheless, Bev is pretty far gone before the spree unspools. The police are canvassing the neighborhood for an obscene caller initially when they poke their inquisitive noses in at Beverly's house. Waters ridicules everything from gory exploitation movies to culinary habits. Nobody escapes notice in this outrageous laugh riot except perhaps gay people. Beverly racks up seven murders to her credit, killing her victims with everything from a knife to a leg of lamb to a toppled air conditioner. Interestingly, Beverly's last victim is none other than Patty Hearst. Throughout it all, Turner similes and slays. Ultimately, of course, our leading lady is charged with murder and lands in court where she dismisses her attorney and conducts her defense. "Serial Mom" is such a bright, shiny, polished epic that it is difficult to believe that it is so bloodthirsty. Mind you, the language gets rather profane at times. Lots of pop culture references spring up, ranging from Suzanne Somers to Bill Cosby movies. Despite all the carefree blood and gore, the most agonizing scene occurs when we are forced to watch a couple as they gnaw on fried chicken. One of the most taboo scenes takes place when a concupiscent teen masturbates to the Chesty Morgan soft-porn spy movie "Deadly Weapons." Chesty is determined to kill the dastards who killed her man so she smothers them with her ponderous breasts.

Good grief, can we take an unbiased look at the film and point out how God awful the dialogue is? Who the hell says "You bring me such peace" during sex? The characters in crappy movies like this one. The plot is so contrived. How did she know her victim would stop running long enough for her to drop an AC on him. Everything just happens to fit into place for the main character. There are so many things that are just awkwardly unrealistic. Of course, if you're being chased by a murderous woman, you're OBVIOUSLY gonna wanna try to hide in a venue that for some strange reason is having band play at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. Id say that since the 20th anniversary of Serial Mom is coming up, we should all celebrate by pretending this turd was never pushed out.

    This mainstream effort from the great cult director John Waters is a blackly hilarious treat, taking satirical jabs at suburbia, family life, and the celebrity treatment often afforded real life criminals. Kathleen Turner shines in one of her best roles as Beverly Sutphin, a beaming suburban mom with a loyal dentist husband (Sam Waterston), a lonely daughter (Ricki Lake), and a horror genre obsessed son (Matthew Lillard, warming up for his not dissimilar role in "Scream"). The trouble is, Beverly is easily annoyed, and any person who offends her sets of values or threatens the sanctity of her family will find their time to be extremely short. Eventually, she's caught, and her trial is turned into something of a circus, with tie in products being peddled such as a book adaptation and T-shirts. The portrayal of the way that killers can become a part of the popular culture is really spot on. "Serial Mom" goes so far as to make a point of the inevitable made for TV version of the events, with Suzanne Somers, doing a cameo as herself, tapped to play Beverly and hanging around as the trial unfolds. The delightful tongue in cheek approach shows how people start rallying around Serial Mom and find the actions of those she hates - such as not recycling - much more heinous than anything she does. Waters's wicked sense of humour is just great, especially when he has a victim bludgeoned with a leg of lamb while the song "Tomorrow" from the 1982 film version of "Annnie" serves as accompaniment. Waters has fun with his methods of murder, not taking them too seriously and not having any two alike; as a result, there's not much in the way of gore. (Although there is one priceless darkly comedic gag when it comes to the heart of one victim.) Waters maintains a likably self referential approach, and clips from movies such as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", "Blood Feast", and "Double Agent 73" show on screen, making this movie a treat to watch for cult film fans. The acting is enjoyable, from Waters regulars such as Mink Stole, Patricia Hearst, and Traci Lords, with Patricia Dunnock a delight as Lillard's gal pal. The movie has good energy, maintaining a nice off the wall sensibility from start to finish. It's just too hard to resist. Eight out of 10.

    Kathleen Turner is hilarious as a mass murderess in director John Water's "Serial Mom" about a housewife who embarks on a homicidal rampage in Baltimore, Maryland. This wonderfully subversive black comedy depicts an apparently PTA mom who begins swapping flies and then graduates to cold-blooded murder. As Beverly Sutphin, Turner kills anybody who offends her dentist husband, gorehound movie buff son, and her hopeless romantic daughter. Nevertheless, Bev is pretty far gone before the spree unspools. The police are canvassing the neighborhood for an obscene caller initially when they poke their inquisitive noses in at Beverly's house. Waters ridicules everything from gory exploitation movies to culinary habits. Nobody escapes notice in this outrageous laugh riot except perhaps gay people. Beverly racks up seven murders to her credit, killing her victims with everything from a knife to a leg of lamb to a toppled air conditioner. Interestingly, Beverly's last victim is none other than Patty Hearst. Throughout it all, Turner similes and slays. Ultimately, of course, our leading lady is charged with murder and lands in court where she dismisses her attorney and conducts her defense. "Serial Mom" is such a bright, shiny, polished epic that it is difficult to believe that it is so bloodthirsty. Mind you, the language gets rather profane at times. Lots of pop culture references spring up, ranging from Suzanne Somers to Bill Cosby movies. Despite all the carefree blood and gore, the most agonizing scene occurs when we are forced to watch a couple as they gnaw on fried chicken. One of the most taboo scenes takes place when a concupiscent teen masturbates to the Chesty Morgan soft-porn spy movie "Deadly Weapons." Chesty is determined to kill the dastards who killed her man so she smothers them with her ponderous breasts.

    SERIAL MOM is one of my all-time favourite black comedies, a genre that's notoriously difficult to get right (I mean, seriously, how many good ones can you think of?). I'm no fan of John Waters - in fact, this is the only film of his I've ever seen - but in this he has created pretty much the perfect antidote to the psycho-thriller genre. Kathleen Turner bags the role of a lifetime as Beverly R. Sutphin, a seemingly ordinary housewife with a sinister side: she bumps off anybody who crosses her. Add in a quirky family (young 'uns Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard are both particularly funny) and you have the scene set for plenty of unusual and unexpected laughs. The murder scene set to ANNIE is by far my favourite moment and one of the funniest things I've ever seen. What I like most about SERIAL MOM is the plot. In lesser hands, Turner would have successfully covered up her murders for the film's duration. Not so here - she's discovered, and becomes an unlikely celebrity, basking in her new-found fame. This gives Waters plenty of opportunity for satirising American law and order, fame, celebrity as well as suburban life and the nuclear family. DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES may satirise those kinds of things these days, but SERIAL MOM got there first!

    If it hadn't combined Kathleen Turner's amazingly over-the-top acting skills and John Waters' genius writing, Serial Mom would've been lost cause and a complete missed opportunity. Thankfully, both talents are used exquisitely and we get a pleasant turnout from one of the most daring and provocative filmmakers of our time. Using words like "exaggerated" and "unrealistic" to bash Serial Mom is like criticizing water for being colorless. It's supposed to be like that, and I don't think that registers with a lot of people. This is a difficult film for the public to swallow, but not for fans of Waters. He knows how to create a film from the ground up, and choose specific films that don't have blueprints to their name. He can make an original story, the problem just stems from marketing and MPAA agreement. He's lucky to be understood since his first film, or else, he'd be living the Babs Johnson lifestyle. The story revolves around Beverly Sutphin (Turner) a mom living with her husband and her son and daughter. The family resembles something of a Hallmark commercial, or even an ad for burgers or Sunny Delight. Everything is colorful, vibrant, and dripping with satire. Beverly is hiding that she is really a serial killer, hellbent on giving comeuppance to anyone who annoys her in the slightest way. Whether it be her kids' (Lake and Lillard) teachers, a short fused customer, or Mink Stole playing the perfect nervous neighbor, Beverly will find a way to get even with them. Serial Mom doesn't take itself seriously, and knows exactly what it is; a silly satire built on top of cutesy characters who couldn't possibly do anything wrong. The family is almost perfect, with the exception of Sam Waterson as Beverly's husband who seems he was never let in on the joke of this being a satire. Mink Stole, like stated before, is wonderful and wickedly vulgar much like her performance in Waters' trash film Pink Flamingos. This could also be established as Waters' second stab at the mainstream market with the first being Cry Baby. This is when Waters started to loosen his grip on the trash element of his films and focused on making more appealing films, but still incorporating his unique spin on things. If anything, I commend him for changing his style (we can't all stay hooked on perversions and sick characters to make films can we?) I recently watched and reviewed Waters' tour titled This Filthy World where Waters went film by film discussing the fun and hard times he encountered which each one. When talking about Serial Mom he concluded "it was a movie about how much fun it would be to kill people and get away it." Serial Mom understands that statement impeccably because we've all had that sick, sadistic desire to just kill someone who is just aggravating us or simply doesn't know what they're doing. Haven't we? Or am I just a sadist? Starring: Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard, and Mink Stole. Directed by: John Waters.

    Admit it. You know you have wanted to blow away that jerk who plays his music too loud, or the one who doesn't even begin to reach into her purse until the cashier has rung up all her groceries. Well, Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) doesn't just think about it, she takes action. Soccer mom by day, and serial killer by night. Only the mind of John Waters can come up with a perfect combination of gross and funny. The Sutphin family also includes Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard). Turner gives a highly underrated performance in a film that humorously exposes the culture of violence in which we all live.

    Uncreative, absurd plot, poorly shot, ridiculous acting and, above all, tremendously unfunny! I'm an easy going person and, still, this movie was a torture to watch. I would actually have stopped watching it after 15 or 20 minutes but, since reviews had been kind of okay, I kept at it hoping the movie would improve. Unfortunately it only got worse with every passing minute. And please don't think I "simply didn't get it". I fully understood the supposed satire Waters was trying to produce. It simply didn't work. Watching this film was a complete waste of my time, except for the fact that it will keep me away from any other Waters movies.

    I wasn't familiar with director John Waters or dark/black humor-except the Addams Family movies. But since 1993 to the present, I've familiarized myself w/ a lot more. For starters, this was my first movie by JW and one of the first with Kathleen Turner. I first watched this at age 13, so needless to say, I was rather naive then. I've owned it on VHS, DVD(both editions) so obviously, it's one of my favorites. Along with Kathleen Turner, it also stars Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard as their adult kids, and Sam Waterston as a rather goofy husband. Most of the murders look so goofy, you can't possibly take this seriously, but maybe that was the point. Plus, her killing motives are goofy, not to mention ridiculous, although most involved slander of her family, subtle or major. Even after (finally) seeing Pink Flamingos- funny but gross) Cecil B. Demented-talk about bizarre) Cry-baby-some good musical numbers, both versions of Hairspray-both fairly enjoyable to me, and lastly, Pecker is probably my least favorite, Serial Mom remains my all-time favorite John Waters movie, to this day.

    Kathleen Turner rocks the house and her neighborhood as the picture-perfect mom who takes matters into her own hands to correct behaviors she considers bad manners. And if murder is the method in which she either corrects these behaviors (or simply eliminates them altogether), that's just too bad, because like fellow John Waters heroine Edna Turnblad ("Hairspray"), her diet pill is wearing off, and like Francine Fishpaw of "Polyester", she just can't take any more heartbreak! Imagine if Divine had lived long enough to do this movie. The obese drag queen would have added a grotesque image to the character of Beverly Sutphin, suburban Baltimore wife and mother who doesn't allow her children to use "the brown word", has a police officer remove the gum he's chewing, and treats her hard-working garbage men to mini-bottles as she comments on neighbor Mary Catlett's refusal to recycle. Then, there's the "Annie" watching video store customer of her son's who refuses to rewind (taken care of deliciously to the song "Tomorrow", much like the art patron bludgeoned in "A Clockwork Orange" to "Singin' in the Rain"), the math teacher who considers her son a wastrel, and the patient of her dentist husband who upsets her even more as she plots his and his wife's demise by eating cute Cornish hens. Taking care of all of these ne'er-do-wells (in her mind) is Kathleen Turner at her most beautiful, her husky voice perfectly suited to an obscene phone call to obnoxious neighbor Mink Stole, and deliciously rubbing it in later on in an extremely funny court scene where she wins over one witness by doing a "Basic Instinct" Sharon Stone impression for him. She also gets to visit a men's bathroom in a hysterically gross sequence where she takes care of daughter Rikki Lake's boyfriend who has dumped her for none other than Tracy Lords. Sound like another visit to Stepford? This is one woman who hasn't been robotized for her man (Sam Waterston), even though she goes out of her way to please him much to her children's discomfort. Turner rocks in this film, and while it definitely continues her "camp" quotient, it also as a "quote quotient" of hysterically funny memorable lines that have ended up as sketches in various drag shows across the country. John Waters adds just enough bad taste to keep the film amusing throughout, and you will not soon forget it. In fact, you may find yourself watching the film over just as soon as you've finished it to make sure you didn't miss anything the first time!

    Beverly Sutphin seems to be the perfect Baltimore housewife; she cares for her family, does the recycling, she even likes the birds that come to her gardenshe is also a killer! To begin with her crimes were limited to making obscene phone calls to one of her neighbours but when one of her son's teachers says he thinks he needs psychiatric help because of the violent pictures he draws... he has to go. The police are soon suspicious but there is no firm evidence. Soon she strikes again; killing the boy who dumped her daughter. With the police following her it looks as though she won't be able to kill again but she soon does. By the time she is finally arrested six people have died at her hands! Her family are obviously somewhat disturbed by it all but that doesn't stop her son and his friend Birdie helping her escape at one point. Once caught she is put on trial and with all the evidence there is no way she will get off is there? This is a difficult film to categorise; on the one hand the comedy it delivered with a light touch on the other the subject matter is dark and there is plenty to offend those who are bothered by swearing or violence. Kathleen Turner is great as the psychotic 'perfect mother'; I loved how her character was willing to murder but couldn't tolerate the slightest social faux pas. While it is very much her movie she is ably supported by Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard and Patricia Dunnock amongst others. The violence isn't too gory; in fact the way it is portrayed is fairly funny in a bad taste sort of way! After the murders things get even funnier when Beverly is put on trial; she hilariously discredits each of the witnesses in a way that could only work in a comedy such as this. I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who wants a good laugh but isn't easily offended.
