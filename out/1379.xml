    In the last day for changing the course in the Melbourne University, the lesbian cinema student Mia (Frances O'Connor) misses her girlfriend Danni (Radha Mitchell), who is dating Savita (Suzi Dougherty), and is trapped in the bureaucracy of the university to transfer to another course. Her mate and best friend Alice (Alice Garner) is seeking out a roommate to share the expenses of their new house, and is alone trying to find a boyfriend that is left-handed and enjoys the same movies as she. Alice is having trouble to complete her thesis about Doris Day, and she has organized a party for that night in their house. Meanwhile the popular student of medicine Ari (Matthew Dyktynski) befriends the lonely Michael Douglas (Matt Day), who has difficulties to relate with girls and wants to move from his house. Ari introduces Michael to Mia and Alice and they invite him to their party. Along the night, Mia and Danny resolve their issues while Alice and Michael find that they have many points in common. "Love and Other Catastrophes" is a dull, but entertaining low-budget movie. The story is extremely simple and boring in some moments, like for example, when Mia is fighting against the stupid bureaucracy of her university. Nevertheless, the cast is extremely charismatic and shows chemistry, and the young actors and actresses have great performances. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Amor e Outras Cat&aacute;strofes" ("Love and Other Catastrophes")

    The Australian move "Love and Other Catastrophes" is an incisive, often satirical insight into the lives and loves of a group of university students. This lighthearted Aussie film travels well and manages to hold the viewers interest until quite late on, when our writer-director Emma-Kate Croghan is forced to tie up her loose ends. Perhaps leaving some untied may have been advisable. Solid, believable turns from the cast including Matthew Dyktynski, Alice Garner and Radha Mitchell (except a grating Matt Day) help out. A groovy soundtrack adds flavour. Monday, December 1st, 1997 - Hoyts Croydon

    "Love and Other Catastrophes" is co-written and co-produced by a Jewish Australian woman, makes some jokes on Woody Allen, and doesn't repeat any of his stereotypes. There's an interesting Jewish character or two - including a guy named Ari who is a lothario and a guy considering a circumcision due to the demands of his Jewish girlfriend. It fits nicely in the genre of twentysomething roommates seeking love, i.e. "Singles," "Kicking and Screaming," etc. The lesbian couple is treated completely naturally and romantically and is really the most interesting couple. None of the guys even assume the lesbian's straight best friend is gay, as I think would happen in most American films. The film student satires are a bit heavy handed, but on a whole it's a cute, funny first-time movie casually made. I only recognized two songs out of the whole soundtrack as it was filled with Australian rock 'n' roll I've never heard before. (originally written 4/2/1997)

    The one word review for this effort would have to be twee. The words wet and trite also come to mind, but it has some things in its favour. The relatively unconcerned approach to the depiction of the relationship between the two lesbians is refreshingly focused purely on the internal dynamic, and not milked for any audience reaction. This I feel would be in stark contrast to a similar film made by Americans. Over there the concept of sexual deviation has moral overtones that are not as important in most sections of our occasionally more enlightened society, and there are several in-jokes for film-students, clumsily handled though they may be. As a detached observer of the behavioural mores of this group, it seems incredibly bourgeois as well: they are all so clean and bright-eyed. Perhaps this is just a reflection of the socio-economic background of the director: I lived in Fitzroy and Carlton in my younger days, and the Melbourne Uni students I met had a harder edge than this bunch of fluffy ducks. Their concerns were, shall we say, less egocentric. But I show my age, and the fact that I never went to Uni as a youngster, and perhaps have a more prosaic perception of it. The story is utter guff really, girl/boy meets/splits up with girl/boy/girl, overcomes obstacles and they all live happily ever after. Deep it ain't, there are absolutely no motivational insights into any character: they are all ciphers from a psycho-sexual point of view, and we are just invited to laugh along with then without knowing who they are, why they are there, or what they want beyond the Women's Weekly dream&#8230;spare me!! It is a nice little effort from a novice director, cheaply done, and Frances O'Connor is always good to look at, but really&#8230;who cares about these dills and their little koffee-klatch? Not even some gratuitous nudity would have saved this one in my books.

    This low-budget comedy was the debut of Emma Kate Groghan and it remains one of the freshest Australian romantic comedies in recent years. Given the limitations of the budget, one would have expected it to fall flat at times; the opposite is true. The cast do a very good job with the offbeat script, most notably Frances Connor and Radha Mitchell. Set in a Melbourne University, Connor takes center stage in a tale of unrequited love and missed glances. The comedic element is often tempered with dark touches which makes a change from the usual limitations of romantic comedies. The end might be a tad obvious but it gels in well with the genuine feel-good nature of the film.

    I took this movie out for a lunch time laugh and instead was forced to suffer through some of the most amateurish writing and acting I have ever seen. The plot (in it's thinnest of definitions) is riddled with meaningless moments that are sad little attempts at humour. The acting, especially by Matt Day, is truly despairing to watch and brings a new meaning to "Flat". Having said that Frances O'Connor does show the potential which eventually led to her being noticed by Steven Spielberg for A.I. All in all, one dimensional rubbish. I gave it 3/10 because it deserves two points for inspiring any person wanting to make a film: ie, if this can get made, then there's hope for you. If not, then watch "Strange Planet". It's by the same director and is just a much, much better film.

    this is one of the few successful attempts at trying to capture the vitality, the heart-break, the ecstacy and the madness of college life and campus romances. this is about the desperate and hurried search of adolescents, on the brink of adulthood, for meaningful romances and fulfilling careers. the terrible reality of their tribulations and the utter pettiness of their failures, the monstrosities of their triumphs and the fleetingness of their celebrations. debutante director emma kate croghan captures all this beautifully in putting together a few days in the lives of group of friends. the shoe-string budget of $37,000, provides for the warmth and credibility of the characters and their situations. clearly this is a movie that would have been a disaster with a million dollar budget. the characters are portrayed extremely realistically by the fresh actors and each of the characters shines through with their ability to convey the humor of their plights. all in all, a delightful movie that does not tax the viewer much, but takes one along for a voyeuristic look into campus lives. this might not be one of the three best movies of my life (watch the movie to understand the significance of top three movies) but it is one of the top 5 English language movies of the 90s, whose central theme is love. 5. chasing amy 4. as good as it gets 3. love and other catastrophes 2. before sunrise 1. high fidelity anyway, this one is a winner. a delightful 9!

    The only reason I lasted past the first 5 minutes of this movie (on cable last night) was the 3-star rating from the digital cable guide. I almost changed the channel, but decided to give it another 5 minutes, and I'm glad I did. It is quite slow-moving though, especially in the beginning. A nice little movie, but the acting is definitely the best thing about it. It could have been so much better with a catchier opening and better dialogue throughout... but still it's worth watching. The best scenes are Michael (Matt Day) talking to himself in the mirror, and his subsequent discomfort at the party... classic!

    1996 must have been a lousy year for Aussie films considering the nominations which this klunker received. "Love and Other...." tells of a day in the life of Mia (O'Connor), a lesbian college student who's having a bad day not unlike the audience. This kinda-sorta comedy isn't likely to evoke even a giggle from the average viewer as it staggers amateurishly through its pedestrian story bleeding and in need of a plot...a burial plot.

It is a nice little effort from a novice director, cheaply done, and Frances O'Connor is always good to look at, but really&#8230;who cares about these dills and their little koffee-klatch? Not even some gratuitous nudity would have saved this one in my books.

    This low-budget comedy was the debut of Emma Kate Groghan and it remains one of the freshest Australian romantic comedies in recent years. Given the limitations of the budget, one would have expected it to fall flat at times; the opposite is true. The cast do a very good job with the offbeat script, most notably Frances Connor and Radha Mitchell. Set in a Melbourne University, Connor takes center stage in a tale of unrequited love and missed glances. The comedic element is often tempered with dark touches which makes a change from the usual limitations of romantic comedies. The end might be a tad obvious but it gels in well with the genuine feel-good nature of the film.

    I took this movie out for a lunch time laugh and instead was forced to suffer through some of the most amateurish writing and acting I have ever seen. The plot (in it's thinnest of definitions) is riddled with meaningless moments that are sad little attempts at humour. The acting, especially by Matt Day, is truly despairing to watch and brings a new meaning to "Flat". Having said that Frances O'Connor does show the potential which eventually led to her being noticed by Steven Spielberg for A.I. All in all, one dimensional rubbish. I gave it 3/10 because it deserves two points for inspiring any person wanting to make a film: ie, if this can get made, then there's hope for you. If not, then watch "Strange Planet". It's by the same director and is just a much, much better film.

    this is one of the few successful attempts at trying to capture the vitality, the heart-break, the ecstacy and the madness of college life and campus romances. this is about the desperate and hurried search of adolescents, on the brink of adulthood, for meaningful romances and fulfilling careers. the terrible reality of their tribulations and the utter pettiness of their failures, the monstrosities of their triumphs and the fleetingness of their celebrations. debutante director emma kate croghan captures all this beautifully in putting together a few days in the lives of group of friends. the shoe-string budget of $37,000, provides for the warmth and credibility of the characters and their situations. clearly this is a movie that would have been a disaster with a million dollar budget. the characters are portrayed extremely realistically by the fresh actors and each of the characters shines through with their ability to convey the humor of their plights. all in all, a delightful movie that does not tax the viewer much, but takes one along for a voyeuristic look into campus lives. this might not be one of the three best movies of my life (watch the movie to understand the significance of top three movies) but it is one of the top 5 English language movies of the 90s, whose central theme is love. 5. chasing amy 4. as good as it gets 3. love and other catastrophes 2. before sunrise 1. high fidelity anyway, this one is a winner. a delightful 9!

    The only reason I lasted past the first 5 minutes of this movie (on cable last night) was the 3-star rating from the digital cable guide. I almost changed the channel, but decided to give it another 5 minutes, and I'm glad I did. It is quite slow-moving though, especially in the beginning. A nice little movie, but the acting is definitely the best thing about it. It could have been so much better with a catchier opening and better dialogue throughout... but still it's worth watching. The best scenes are Michael (Matt Day) talking to himself in the mirror, and his subsequent discomfort at the party... classic!

    1996 must have been a lousy year for Aussie films considering the nominations which this klunker received. "Love and Other...." tells of a day in the life of Mia (O'Connor), a lesbian college student who's having a bad day not unlike the audience. This kinda-sorta comedy isn't likely to evoke even a giggle from the average viewer as it staggers amateurishly through its pedestrian story bleeding and in need of a plot...a burial plot.

    An excellent film. Many will miss the references to life, mainly due to not living it. But it struck a major chord with those that have. A must see if you have enjoyed your college years, or are pursuing them now. A good reference for those attempting fate.
