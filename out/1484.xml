    This film is really pretty awful, but whatever feelings of 'shockingly bad' are generally overcome by mundanity (in other words, it is not a 'so bad it's good' kind of film, rather it's one that continually leaves a question mark in the back of the mind, and as a result perhaps it's why I sat watching the film to end, curious as to just how the train wreck would wrap itself up). I recall laughing at the pranks as a 20- something, but whatever creativity that was present in the original tapes it not present in the movie. Every joke and every scene is so contrived that it is a wonder at all that Alan Arkin agreed to take part in the "romp". I'll give the film a little credit for offering a couple of laughs, but it is nowhere near enough to excuse itself for somehow wriggling its way into existence. As someone else alluded, this creation exists solely because some executive heard the product, thought of the genius concept "movie" and immediately saw dollar signs. As for character development, it is of course non-existent, as the shorter, mullet-toting John Brennan generally finds himself spewing animosity to anyone and everyone in an awkwardly driven attempt to rehash nicknames and one-liners from the old tapes. Kamal shares less lines and mostly acts as the naive, passive sidekick stumbling into an absurd scenario involving mafia, sausages and lots of running away that ultimately makes no sense. Each scene is set up to derive from the previously established pranks in such a way that we always see the joke coming from a mile away. I am at a bit of a loss as to how glowing some of these opinions are. All i can say is I hope the reviewers were either really stoned while watching this one or mistakenly watching a different movie altogether. But to each his own. Bonus: William Hickey playing Don 'Uncle Freddy' Frederico

    The Jerky Boys are a famous comedy duo known for making prank calls which have been recorded and released on albums. I knew about them by the time I first came across a copy of this film for rent at a video store recently, but didn't know they had their own movie until then. Released in 1995, long before I was old enough to watch R-rated movies, "The Jerky Boys" is a comedy starring the two prank callers, John G. Brennan and Kamal Ahmed. By the time I watched this, I had heard many of their recorded prank calls (it seems they were falsely credited for several of the ones I heard, but most of them really were from the duo), and thought they were generally funny, but since I was aware of this film's lack of popularity, I wasn't surprised by its overall mediocrity. Johnny B. and Kamal are two "lowlifes from Queens" who have been making prank telephone calls since they were kids. John's mother warned the two of them what they would be like when they grew up if they didn't change their ways, and sure enough, they have since grown up and turned out to be exactly what she predicted, two unemployed idiots still living at home. Making prank calls is still a major hobby of theirs, and they've had certain jobs in the past, but due to their stupidity and incompetence, they didn't have them for long. Unfortunately for Johnny and Kamal, their prank calling gets them into serious trouble when they call the local mafia and Johnny pretends to be a crime boss from Chicago named Frank Rizzo, and the two of them then pose as two of Rizzo's hoodlums when they go to meet members of the Queens mob in person! They soon find that not only are the local mafia after them, so are the police! Shortly after I began to watch this 1995 flop, I did find myself laughing or at least smiling at times, but not enough to make me think it was a actually a good comedy, and I didn't care for the part with Johnny and Kamal (as kids) watching a boy getting in trouble with his mother after they prank called her, and what the mother says she'll do to her son when they get inside. None of the gags in this movie are among the most revolting I've ever seen, but one fairly lame scene is the one with hot dogs made from human bodies! Most of the film is basically just mediocre, unfunny, and boring. The plot also isn't that interesting, with the two pranksters getting into more and more trouble. I certainly did laugh at times, such as the drive-thru scene and the part where the main characters (the Jerky Boys playing themselves) steal a cab and Kamal poses as the cab driver. These laughs definitely weren't always just small ones, either. Still, for the vast majority of the film, I kept a straight face, and cannot give it a high rating. This silly comedy was apparently panned by critics and seems to be fairly obscure, but it seems that some Jerky Boys fans like it. However, it also appears many of those who have seen it think it's atrocious, and I'm sure a number of the duo's fans have been disappointed by this movie of theirs. As someone who has never listened to any of their albums from start to finish but has heard enough of their recorded pranks individually to be convinced that they know how to be funny, I sure would have been disappointed if I had expected this film to be as good. Apart from occasional funny moments (some very funny and some mildly amusing) and a cameo appearance from Ozzy Osbourne as the Band Manager, there was hardly anything in 1995's "The Jerky Boys" (a.k.a. "The Jerky Boys: The Movie") that appealed to me. If you're not a Jerky Boys fan at all, I suggest you skip this film, and if you are a fan, I can't imagine how you could watch this without finding anything in it funny at all (though you never know), but don't be surprised if you find that it doesn't live up to the duo's audio recordings.

    "The Jerky Boys" is mostly an excuse to be silly. The plot is that slackers Johnny and Kamal spend their lives making prank phone calls and inadvertently call a mob boss (Alan Arkin), pretending to be another mafioso, thereby starting a wacky chain of events. I actually thought that the best parts were the pranks. Still, the flick's an overall fun romp. Far from the funniest movie ever, but OK for a viewing. As it was, I saw this movie right after I first learned of Alan Arkin by seeing "Catch-22", so this was a real surprise. And now he's won an Oscar! Anyway, pretty funny. Also starring William Hickey (the mob boss in "Prizzi's Honor" and the patriarch in "Mouse Hunt").

    This movie could have been a lot funnier if only they didn't use almost the exact same dialogue from their prank calls. Seriously some of the scenes from the movie are almost word-for-word with the calls. If you haven't heard their "jerky-isms" (rubberbeck, sizzle-chest) then this might be funny to you. Anyway the movie is about two "low-lifes from Queens", two late-20's guys who can't get a job who still live at home. They end up calling a random number which just happens to be a local mob boss. Johnny Brennan does his hilarious Frank Rizzo voice claiming to be childhood friends with the guy who becomes infuriated after being called "fruity-a$$". (the only really funny scene.) Once they meet the boys in person, an arrogant local boy Brett Weir sees them at the same restaurant and clues the mafia in as to who the Jerky Boys really are. So the rest of the movie is basically them trying to outrun the mob. Some scenes following were okay, with a cameo by Ozzy Ozbourne and the NY hardcore band Helmet. In the end when the gang kidnaps Johnny's mom and fits her for a pair of cement shoes, Johnny and Kamal call the newspapers up to expose the mob. The end. A lot of people said the plot was clich&eacute;d. Not really, I thought it worked good, it just wasn't EXECUTED properly. And by properly, I mean humorously. The first time I heard the call about the old man with the Mexican immigrant worker it was funny. "I kicked him in his little hiney" The second time it seemed rushed, like they had to create a scene where the actions would fit perfectly with the call. This one happens to be made over a call box on a warehouse where the bad guys are standing near, to distract them while the boys escape. Some of the actors, who have played distinguished, critically-acclaimed roles in other movies (Alan Arkin, Vincent Pastore, William Hickey) seem like they're having a REAL hard time saying their lines. They must have needed money. I won't tell you not to see it, because as far as i know it has not been released on DVD. And I can guarantee you can find it for a buck or two at almost ANY movie store. So if you have or haven't heard the prank call albums but you still want to see it, you'll only be a few bucks short if you don't like it.

    I am a huge fan of these two. I know the majority of people hate these guy's, but I think they are brilliant. This movie was widely panned over by critics and movie goers, but it is just another great example of the genius that is the Jerky Boys. You have to know their prank phone call background to fully appreciate all the jokes in this movie. And to listen to their prank call CD's, you start to see how quick witted these two are, to come up with the calls they do is pure genius. Listen to the CD's and then watch this movie, you will laugh your butt off, I can almost guarantee it ! Just watch the 'drive through' scene in this movie to see one of the funniest bits on film ever !

    This movie was incredibly funny and refreshingly original. The two boys play great roles as the jerkiest prank callers ever seen, causing trouble and getting into hilarious dilemmas. I found the movie excellent and I think any one with a not-so-serious personality would find it a great film. I give it ten out of ten because it is far ahead of its genre, matching, if not beating such similar films as Dumb and Dumber and Wayne's World 2. It establishes its comedy on simple humor and doesn't derive itself from ridiculously complex politics, boring celebrities, and doesn't rely on sexual overtones (although it would do great with them). I would put it on par with many other funny movies I've seen and I must say, I would be very happy if it was aired on television for once.

    Okay, I know this film is about as dumb as it gets but man did my friends and I get a laugh out of it. I started listening to the Jerky Boys many years ago and their first two audio recordings were some of the funniest stuff I ever heard (that and the Tube Bar recordings). When I heard a movie was actually coming out, I new it was going to be bad and filled up with old jokes from their earlier recordings. But that was what I was hoping for. I wasn't really looking for anything new, I was just looking for some live action versions of the calls, and that is basically what I got. The story is Johnny and Kamal are two losers who have been hanging out since little kids making prank phone calls. They grow up and haven't changed a bit. One day they see an old school friend (not really a friend) who says he is working for the mafia. So what do Johnny and Kamal do? They call up this mob boss played by Alan Arkin. They say they were sent by Frank Rizzo and basically they completely make a fool of him. Well, the story continues like this and they get in all sorts of trouble and have to incorporate much of their alternate personalities to survive from being lynched by the mob at the end. This is incredibly stupid, but a lot of fun. Don't expect to much out of the movie but if you are a fan you should get some laughs out of this. I give it a 7/10.

    To be fair the title itself doesn't really get this film off to the best of starts and i was not really impressed by the DVD case or anything about it, however never judge a book by its cover, as i came to find out. The jerky boys main strength lies in the quality of 'Gangster accents'' portrayed by the lead characters. The whole idea of two 30 year old men sitting round making obscene and very funny phone calls all day would in principle sound like an unattractive watch. In saying this though the jerky boys has some hilarious moments which left me and my father in fits of laughter, (no exaggeration),. IN terms of a plot the jerky boys doesn't come off so well which is why all included i feel it overall deserves a 6. To conclude if your looking for a quick laugh, nothing special or something funny to watch with friends I highly recommend the jerky boys.

    Simply stated, if you are a fan of the Jerky Boys from their CDs, and then perhaps watch this movie "just to see who these guys are", you will be entertained by some of the movie. If you are not a fan of the Jerky Boys -- or worse yet, have never heard their stuff -- you will be completely puzzled about why this thing was ever made or even what it is supposed to be. There is lame story buried under all the random bits, but that can't hold it together. Although it is nice to see Brett Weir finally get his, I would rather Sparky the Clown just stay in my imagination. (especially since on the album, the Sparky routine was hilarious) I am a huge Jerky Boys fan and I still can't muster anything above a "5". In fact even if you are a Jerky Boys aficionado, it wouldn't hurt to have a few beers before watching this flick.

    This is one of the greatest comedy films of all time. I can watch this over and over again and still laugh. The characters are very memorable. I don't want to say more about the film so as not to spoil it. Unfortunately I don't think this film exists on DVD so you have to get the VHS out of the closet or garage to see it. Good performances also by Vincent Pastore, Alan Arkin and Kamal Ahmed. Johnny Brennan is probably the greatest comedian of all time and for sure the most under-rated comedian of all time - no question about that. Go see it now liver-lips, or Frank Rizzo will split your nuts from your head to the back of your ass!

The story is Johnny and Kamal are two losers who have been hanging out since little kids making prank phone calls. They grow up and haven't changed a bit. One day they see an old school friend (not really a friend) who says he is working for the mafia. So what do Johnny and Kamal do? They call up this mob boss played by Alan Arkin. They say they were sent by Frank Rizzo and basically they completely make a fool of him. Well, the story continues like this and they get in all sorts of trouble and have to incorporate much of their alternate personalities to survive from being lynched by the mob at the end. This is incredibly stupid, but a lot of fun. Don't expect to much out of the movie but if you are a fan you should get some laughs out of this. I give it a 7/10.

    To be fair the title itself doesn't really get this film off to the best of starts and i was not really impressed by the DVD case or anything about it, however never judge a book by its cover, as i came to find out. The jerky boys main strength lies in the quality of 'Gangster accents'' portrayed by the lead characters. The whole idea of two 30 year old men sitting round making obscene and very funny phone calls all day would in principle sound like an unattractive watch. In saying this though the jerky boys has some hilarious moments which left me and my father in fits of laughter, (no exaggeration),. IN terms of a plot the jerky boys doesn't come off so well which is why all included i feel it overall deserves a 6. To conclude if your looking for a quick laugh, nothing special or something funny to watch with friends I highly recommend the jerky boys.

    Simply stated, if you are a fan of the Jerky Boys from their CDs, and then perhaps watch this movie "just to see who these guys are", you will be entertained by some of the movie. If you are not a fan of the Jerky Boys -- or worse yet, have never heard their stuff -- you will be completely puzzled about why this thing was ever made or even what it is supposed to be. There is lame story buried under all the random bits, but that can't hold it together. Although it is nice to see Brett Weir finally get his, I would rather Sparky the Clown just stay in my imagination. (especially since on the album, the Sparky routine was hilarious) I am a huge Jerky Boys fan and I still can't muster anything above a "5". In fact even if you are a Jerky Boys aficionado, it wouldn't hurt to have a few beers before watching this flick.

    This is one of the greatest comedy films of all time. I can watch this over and over again and still laugh. The characters are very memorable. I don't want to say more about the film so as not to spoil it. Unfortunately I don't think this film exists on DVD so you have to get the VHS out of the closet or garage to see it. Good performances also by Vincent Pastore, Alan Arkin and Kamal Ahmed. Johnny Brennan is probably the greatest comedian of all time and for sure the most under-rated comedian of all time - no question about that. Go see it now liver-lips, or Frank Rizzo will split your nuts from your head to the back of your ass!

    This film is really pretty awful, but whatever feelings of 'shockingly bad' are generally overcome by mundanity (in other words, it is not a 'so bad it's good' kind of film, rather it's one that continually leaves a question mark in the back of the mind, and as a result perhaps it's why I sat watching the film to end, curious as to just how the train wreck would wrap itself up). I recall laughing at the pranks as a 20- something, but whatever creativity that was present in the original tapes it not present in the movie. Every joke and every scene is so contrived that it is a wonder at all that Alan Arkin agreed to take part in the "romp". I'll give the film a little credit for offering a couple of laughs, but it is nowhere near enough to excuse itself for somehow wriggling its way into existence. As someone else alluded, this creation exists solely because some executive heard the product, thought of the genius concept "movie" and immediately saw dollar signs. As for character development, it is of course non-existent, as the shorter, mullet-toting John Brennan generally finds himself spewing animosity to anyone and everyone in an awkwardly driven attempt to rehash nicknames and one-liners from the old tapes. Kamal shares less lines and mostly acts as the naive, passive sidekick stumbling into an absurd scenario involving mafia, sausages and lots of running away that ultimately makes no sense. Each scene is set up to derive from the previously established pranks in such a way that we always see the joke coming from a mile away. I am at a bit of a loss as to how glowing some of these opinions are. All i can say is I hope the reviewers were either really stoned while watching this one or mistakenly watching a different movie altogether. But to each his own. Bonus: William Hickey playing Don 'Uncle Freddy' Frederico

    The Jerky Boys are a famous comedy duo known for making prank calls which have been recorded and released on albums. I knew about them by the time I first came across a copy of this film for rent at a video store recently, but didn't know they had their own movie until then. Released in 1995, long before I was old enough to watch R-rated movies, "The Jerky Boys" is a comedy starring the two prank callers, John G. Brennan and Kamal Ahmed. By the time I watched this, I had heard many of their recorded prank calls (it seems they were falsely credited for several of the ones I heard, but most of them really were from the duo), and thought they were generally funny, but since I was aware of this film's lack of popularity, I wasn't surprised by its overall mediocrity. Johnny B. and Kamal are two "lowlifes from Queens" who have been making prank telephone calls since they were kids. John's mother warned the two of them what they would be like when they grew up if they didn't change their ways, and sure enough, they have since grown up and turned out to be exactly what she predicted, two unemployed idiots still living at home. Making prank calls is still a major hobby of theirs, and they've had certain jobs in the past, but due to their stupidity and incompetence, they didn't have them for long. Unfortunately for Johnny and Kamal, their prank calling gets them into serious trouble when they call the local mafia and Johnny pretends to be a crime boss from Chicago named Frank Rizzo, and the two of them then pose as two of Rizzo's hoodlums when they go to meet members of the Queens mob in person! They soon find that not only are the local mafia after them, so are the police! Shortly after I began to watch this 1995 flop, I did find myself laughing or at least smiling at times, but not enough to make me think it was a actually a good comedy, and I didn't care for the part with Johnny and Kamal (as kids) watching a boy getting in trouble with his mother after they prank called her, and what the mother says she'll do to her son when they get inside. None of the gags in this movie are among the most revolting I've ever seen, but one fairly lame scene is the one with hot dogs made from human bodies! Most of the film is basically just mediocre, unfunny, and boring. The plot also isn't that interesting, with the two pranksters getting into more and more trouble. I certainly did laugh at times, such as the drive-thru scene and the part where the main characters (the Jerky Boys playing themselves) steal a cab and Kamal poses as the cab driver. These laughs definitely weren't always just small ones, either. Still, for the vast majority of the film, I kept a straight face, and cannot give it a high rating. This silly comedy was apparently panned by critics and seems to be fairly obscure, but it seems that some Jerky Boys fans like it. However, it also appears many of those who have seen it think it's atrocious, and I'm sure a number of the duo's fans have been disappointed by this movie of theirs. As someone who has never listened to any of their albums from start to finish but has heard enough of their recorded pranks individually to be convinced that they know how to be funny, I sure would have been disappointed if I had expected this film to be as good. Apart from occasional funny moments (some very funny and some mildly amusing) and a cameo appearance from Ozzy Osbourne as the Band Manager, there was hardly anything in 1995's "The Jerky Boys" (a.k.a. "The Jerky Boys: The Movie") that appealed to me. If you're not a Jerky Boys fan at all, I suggest you skip this film, and if you are a fan, I can't imagine how you could watch this without finding anything in it funny at all (though you never know), but don't be surprised if you find that it doesn't live up to the duo's audio recordings.

    "The Jerky Boys" is mostly an excuse to be silly. The plot is that slackers Johnny and Kamal spend their lives making prank phone calls and inadvertently call a mob boss (Alan Arkin), pretending to be another mafioso, thereby starting a wacky chain of events. I actually thought that the best parts were the pranks. Still, the flick's an overall fun romp. Far from the funniest movie ever, but OK for a viewing. As it was, I saw this movie right after I first learned of Alan Arkin by seeing "Catch-22", so this was a real surprise. And now he's won an Oscar! Anyway, pretty funny. Also starring William Hickey (the mob boss in "Prizzi's Honor" and the patriarch in "Mouse Hunt").

    This movie could have been a lot funnier if only they didn't use almost the exact same dialogue from their prank calls. Seriously some of the scenes from the movie are almost word-for-word with the calls. If you haven't heard their "jerky-isms" (rubberbeck, sizzle-chest) then this might be funny to you. Anyway the movie is about two "low-lifes from Queens", two late-20's guys who can't get a job who still live at home. They end up calling a random number which just happens to be a local mob boss. Johnny Brennan does his hilarious Frank Rizzo voice claiming to be childhood friends with the guy who becomes infuriated after being called "fruity-a$$". (the only really funny scene.) Once they meet the boys in person, an arrogant local boy Brett Weir sees them at the same restaurant and clues the mafia in as to who the Jerky Boys really are. So the rest of the movie is basically them trying to outrun the mob. Some scenes following were okay, with a cameo by Ozzy Ozbourne and the NY hardcore band Helmet. In the end when the gang kidnaps Johnny's mom and fits her for a pair of cement shoes, Johnny and Kamal call the newspapers up to expose the mob. The end. A lot of people said the plot was clich&eacute;d. Not really, I thought it worked good, it just wasn't EXECUTED properly. And by properly, I mean humorously. The first time I heard the call about the old man with the Mexican immigrant worker it was funny. "I kicked him in his little hiney" The second time it seemed rushed, like they had to create a scene where the actions would fit perfectly with the call. This one happens to be made over a call box on a warehouse where the bad guys are standing near, to distract them while the boys escape. Some of the actors, who have played distinguished, critically-acclaimed roles in other movies (Alan Arkin, Vincent Pastore, William Hickey) seem like they're having a REAL hard time saying their lines. They must have needed money. I won't tell you not to see it, because as far as i know it has not been released on DVD. And I can guarantee you can find it for a buck or two at almost ANY movie store. So if you have or haven't heard the prank call albums but you still want to see it, you'll only be a few bucks short if you don't like it.

    I am a huge fan of these two. I know the majority of people hate these guy's, but I think they are brilliant. This movie was widely panned over by critics and movie goers, but it is just another great example of the genius that is the Jerky Boys. You have to know their prank phone call background to fully appreciate all the jokes in this movie. And to listen to their prank call CD's, you start to see how quick witted these two are, to come up with the calls they do is pure genius. Listen to the CD's and then watch this movie, you will laugh your butt off, I can almost guarantee it ! Just watch the 'drive through' scene in this movie to see one of the funniest bits on film ever !

    This movie was incredibly funny and refreshingly original. The two boys play great roles as the jerkiest prank callers ever seen, causing trouble and getting into hilarious dilemmas. I found the movie excellent and I think any one with a not-so-serious personality would find it a great film. I give it ten out of ten because it is far ahead of its genre, matching, if not beating such similar films as Dumb and Dumber and Wayne's World 2. It establishes its comedy on simple humor and doesn't derive itself from ridiculously complex politics, boring celebrities, and doesn't rely on sexual overtones (although it would do great with them). I would put it on par with many other funny movies I've seen and I must say, I would be very happy if it was aired on television for once.

    Okay, I know this film is about as dumb as it gets but man did my friends and I get a laugh out of it. I started listening to the Jerky Boys many years ago and their first two audio recordings were some of the funniest stuff I ever heard (that and the Tube Bar recordings). When I heard a movie was actually coming out, I new it was going to be bad and filled up with old jokes from their earlier recordings. But that was what I was hoping for. I wasn't really looking for anything new, I was just looking for some live action versions of the calls, and that is basically what I got. The story is Johnny and Kamal are two losers who have been hanging out since little kids making prank phone calls. They grow up and haven't changed a bit. One day they see an old school friend (not really a friend) who says he is working for the mafia. So what do Johnny and Kamal do? They call up this mob boss played by Alan Arkin. They say they were sent by Frank Rizzo and basically they completely make a fool of him. Well, the story continues like this and they get in all sorts of trouble and have to incorporate much of their alternate personalities to survive from being lynched by the mob at the end. This is incredibly stupid, but a lot of fun. Don't expect to much out of the movie but if you are a fan you should get some laughs out of this. I give it a 7/10.

And to listen to their prank call CD's, you start to see how quick witted these two are, to come up with the calls they do is pure genius. Listen to the CD's and then watch this movie, you will laugh your butt off, I can almost guarantee it ! Just watch the 'drive through' scene in this movie to see one of the funniest bits on film ever !

    This movie was incredibly funny and refreshingly original. The two boys play great roles as the jerkiest prank callers ever seen, causing trouble and getting into hilarious dilemmas. I found the movie excellent and I think any one with a not-so-serious personality would find it a great film. I give it ten out of ten because it is far ahead of its genre, matching, if not beating such similar films as Dumb and Dumber and Wayne's World 2. It establishes its comedy on simple humor and doesn't derive itself from ridiculously complex politics, boring celebrities, and doesn't rely on sexual overtones (although it would do great with them). I would put it on par with many other funny movies I've seen and I must say, I would be very happy if it was aired on television for once.

    Okay, I know this film is about as dumb as it gets but man did my friends and I get a laugh out of it. I started listening to the Jerky Boys many years ago and their first two audio recordings were some of the funniest stuff I ever heard (that and the Tube Bar recordings). When I heard a movie was actually coming out, I new it was going to be bad and filled up with old jokes from their earlier recordings. But that was what I was hoping for. I wasn't really looking for anything new, I was just looking for some live action versions of the calls, and that is basically what I got. The story is Johnny and Kamal are two losers who have been hanging out since little kids making prank phone calls. They grow up and haven't changed a bit. One day they see an old school friend (not really a friend) who says he is working for the mafia. So what do Johnny and Kamal do? They call up this mob boss played by Alan Arkin. They say they were sent by Frank Rizzo and basically they completely make a fool of him. Well, the story continues like this and they get in all sorts of trouble and have to incorporate much of their alternate personalities to survive from being lynched by the mob at the end. This is incredibly stupid, but a lot of fun. Don't expect to much out of the movie but if you are a fan you should get some laughs out of this. I give it a 7/10.

    To be fair the title itself doesn't really get this film off to the best of starts and i was not really impressed by the DVD case or anything about it, however never judge a book by its cover, as i came to find out. The jerky boys main strength lies in the quality of 'Gangster accents'' portrayed by the lead characters. The whole idea of two 30 year old men sitting round making obscene and very funny phone calls all day would in principle sound like an unattractive watch. In saying this though the jerky boys has some hilarious moments which left me and my father in fits of laughter, (no exaggeration),. IN terms of a plot the jerky boys doesn't come off so well which is why all included i feel it overall deserves a 6. To conclude if your looking for a quick laugh, nothing special or something funny to watch with friends I highly recommend the jerky boys.

    Simply stated, if you are a fan of the Jerky Boys from their CDs, and then perhaps watch this movie "just to see who these guys are", you will be entertained by some of the movie. If you are not a fan of the Jerky Boys -- or worse yet, have never heard their stuff -- you will be completely puzzled about why this thing was ever made or even what it is supposed to be. There is lame story buried under all the random bits, but that can't hold it together. Although it is nice to see Brett Weir finally get his, I would rather Sparky the Clown just stay in my imagination. (especially since on the album, the Sparky routine was hilarious) I am a huge Jerky Boys fan and I still can't muster anything above a "5". In fact even if you are a Jerky Boys aficionado, it wouldn't hurt to have a few beers before watching this flick.

    This is one of the greatest comedy films of all time. I can watch this over and over again and still laugh. The characters are very memorable. I don't want to say more about the film so as not to spoil it. Unfortunately I don't think this film exists on DVD so you have to get the VHS out of the closet or garage to see it. Good performances also by Vincent Pastore, Alan Arkin and Kamal Ahmed. Johnny Brennan is probably the greatest comedian of all time and for sure the most under-rated comedian of all time - no question about that. Go see it now liver-lips, or Frank Rizzo will split your nuts from your head to the back of your ass!
