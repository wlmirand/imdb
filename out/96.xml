    In 1995, eleven years after the events of The Terminator, John is ten years old and living in Los Angels with foster parents. His mother Sarah had been preparing him throughout his child food for his future role as the leader of the human Resistance against Skynet, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a computer factory and remembered to a hospital. First I think this movie is so cool!! It is good idea that the Terminator is support the John. And the idea that computer can disguised the person is nice idea, too. Second I liked the new terminator's running form is funny, and scared. this movie is full of thrilling.

    Though I love the Terminator series, this is my least favorite of the four movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes place about twelve years after the first movie. In this movie we find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents because Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in an asylum for trying to blow up a computer company. The graphics for this movie were far better than what the graphics for the first Terminator movie were. They ought to be, the budget was just over $100,000,000 compared to $6,500,000. That is quite a lot of difference. Anyway, even though this is my least favorite of all four movies I do have some favorite parts. But, before I list them I want to say that I could have gone a lot longer in my life with out seeing the naked asses of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. That said I think I can list my favorite scenes without ever having to reference those scenes again. My first favorite scene is when The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) walks into the road house to get clothes (oops, I'm referring to Arnold being naked). The Terminator takes out five or six bikers. One of the bikers pulls a knife and the Terminator disarms him and stabs the biker through the shoulder and pins him to the pool table. After the Terminator gets clothes and takes a motorcycle, the bartender come out to stop him with a shotgun. The Terminator disarms the bartender and takes his sunglasses, but leaves without further harm to anymore humans. My next favorite scene has to deal with when The Terminator and the T- 1000 and when they first find John Connor. The fight between the two terminators is pretty good. However, I like the chase scene through the storm canals better. The last scene I like is the scene when the T-1000 is defeated. It's a pretty drawn out elaborate fight scene that sees him fall into a vat of molten metal. Unfortunately for the Terminator, and John, that isn't the end of the movie. The Terminator must be destroyed, so he is lowered into the same vat of molten metal. I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. I didn't like how Sarah Connor was extremely butch and gung-ho, I understand it, but I didn't like it.

    In some ways, I see James Cameron and Steven Spielberg as very similar creatures. Both project expansive, extraordinary visions (Spielberg seems more caught up in character while Cameron, equally as invested, is a little more interested in expansive special effects) that while thrilling on an overall scale are often a bit too sentimental which takes away from the overall film. This is not the case with the timelessly bombastic Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Out of all of Cameron's films, the emotional aspect here is really excellent because it's subtle. A great example of this emotional subtlety is the crying scene where Arnie asks a young Edward Furlong what's wrong with his eyes. Classic. The more obvious and over-the-top scenes of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escaping a creepy treatment center are well-acted too, devoid of sentimental music. Just gritty, and unfortunate, reality here. On top of this emotional subtlety comes the action, so when the scenes intended to make the tears start rolling start rolling, the tears genuinely can start rolling. 10/10.

    I definitely prefer this to the original! I don't like calling the sequel to Terminator a better movie, but it is, to me. For Schwarzenegger fans, you will enjoy him in this. For fans of little boys (no) that invoke similar feelings of immense frustration (still no) that Carl Grimes does, you will like John Connor here. Being a child actor in 1991 shouldn't be an excuse, but there it is. Honestly, Linda Hamilton is the main reason to watch this movie, for the majority of viewers. She is insanely hot, despite being a woman with violent tendencies committed to a psychiatric facility (actually that may be part of the reason). The new terminator model is a great twist to the story, also.

    OK, that's the thing with James Cameron, when he announces something it takes almost a decade to come out (still waiting for Avatar 2 and 3). Same thing with "The Terminator: Judgment Day", after the great success of "The Terminator" Cameron received letters and desperate requests to he make a sequel and then he promised he would. 6 years have passed, Cameron had time to do the Excellent "Aliens" and the underrated "The Abyss", and finally in 1991 came this film, and every minute of the wait was worth it! "The Terminator: Judgement Day" is still considered one of the best sequels ever made, not by critics who said that was not even at the level of his predecessor, but by fans who won over the years. Cameron made both classic films totally different, and unforgettable ! The story begins 10 years after the events of the 1st movie and we found Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrested in a rehabilitation clinic accused of attacks of madness and visions with killer robots and the end of the world to come thanks to a nuclear war. On the other side of the story we have John Connor (Edward Furlong), the prodigal son of Sarah Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines, a rebellious and troublemaker boy living with adoptive parents (the characteristics of a true leader, nothing like a suffered childhood to build a strong warrior). But as in the first, a killing machine was sent to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of John, in this one a machine is sent to assassinate John, this work is now up to an advanced model of Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). But just like in the 1st film, the resistance sends someone to protect him in this one, not a beautiful blonde soldier this time but a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). In the 1st movie, Cameron picked sci - fi and action elements evolving them, here he takes on its own material and evolves it to a new level. The critics considered that a more expensive copy, but fans considered a MAGNIFICENT recycling taking everything bigger and bolder. While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute . From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films). Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (like I said, recycling at its best). But it was not just the action that had a huge evolution, but also the stunning visual effects that the film contains (and very advanced for its time). In levels of performances, Schwarzenegger after the 1st film he entered on the map, on this one he definitely gets to be the iconic face of the action genre; Linda Hamilton in the first was a fragile waitress seeing her life suffering from a huge changeover, in this one she became the human exterminator, showing that after the death of her love one she had to learn how to survive alone (and very well by the way). Many fall trying to decide which Cameron's Terminator is the best, for me is hard to say which is above the other. Both have completely different tones and many different aspects and both truly unforgettable, and both received the same title of being the best action movie ever made but Cameron showed that it could be much more than that. With superb performances, stunning visuals and breathtaking action, both "Terminators" are both classics to be remembered forever! 10/10

    Terminator 2 : Judgement Day comes with a really well power-packed action sequence. This really keeps the audience at the peak of the desk. The director makes the film more interesting and finally ends with a huge emotion. The movie overall has a very good story and really goes on well. But, at some times, the movie gets very boring, in other words, the movies gets slow int terms of the storyline. The action performed by both the protagonist and the antagonist are really good. good stunt direction in this film makes this really an awesome experience to watch. since, its a sci-fi movie, there is no need for searching for any logic.

    There are a lot of very entertaining movies out there, and everyone likes that feeling you get when the credits roll at the end of a good flick. But no matter how many times I see it, "Terminator 2" is one of the very few films that leaves me feeling something quite unusual - a sense of absolute awe. I mean, the scale of this movie! You have trucks chasing bikes, helicopters chasing trucks, shootouts, huge explosions; a liquid metal man, a nuclear holocaust, a laser battle in the future; ruminations on the nature and future of humanity; sacrifice, redemption, hope. It's just huge. The pacing is terrific: after an absolutely breakneck first hour, the audience is given time to breathe while the characters reflect on their situation in deeply ruminative scenes in the Mojave desert, before a surprising, action-packed and ultimately moving finale. The lighting and colour grading add to the impact - the many night scenes in Los Angeles are given a slick blue sheen, offering a contrast between the threatening urban environment and the warm colours of the desert. The editing is fast enough to be appropriately exciting while never becoming frenetic or confusing. The music and sound design are impeccable. The T-1000's leitmotif really heightens the creepiness of the character. The gentle acoustic guitar in the desert sequence is both beautiful and ominous, and the Main Title theme is simply one of the greatest pieces of music I've ever heard. Sound design is such an overlooked discipline: I'm certain the average moviegoer has no idea that every footstep, every engine rumble and almost every word of dialogue is replaced during post-production. Here it's perfect, and filled with nice artistic touches such as the extra reverb on Sarah's scream when she first sees Arnie. Even people who don't like this film have to agree that the effects are spectacular, and I've still never seen such convincing use of CGI. I recently found out why: in many cases, CGI was used to provide a smooth transition between real-life animatronic models of the T-1000 in various states of decimation, provided by the workshop of effects genius Stan Winston. The ethos was that if it could be done "in camera", it should - a creed I wish more film-makers followed. It just looks so much better and so much more convincing. It's surprising to find an action film so affecting. The nuclear holocaust, which inspired a reaction along the lines of "awesome" when I first saw it at thirteen, is a scene that as an adult and father I now find truly bloodcurdling and terrifying. Sarah's assassination attempt on Dyson, and John's efforts to stop her, always make a deep impression ("Haven't you figured out why you can't just go around killing people?" Quite so) and I'm not ashamed to say that I've shed a few tears watching Dyson stare into the barrel of Sarah's gun. Everything leads up to the final payoff. I get chills just thinking of the final monologue, delivered over footage of a highway at night, before the credits roll over that epic Main Title theme. It's just an astonishing piece of work, a true masterpiece, hands-down my favourite action film and in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. Two thumbs up for T2!

    Part II picks up many years later, when Sarah Connor is an inmate in a mental asylum(people did not believe her story). Her son John Connor is now a troubled boy, pursued not only by the police, but a new and more advanced Cyborg Killer, the T-1000, made of liquid metal, and seemingly unstoppable, until a familiar Cyborg shows up also in pursuit, not of John, put to protect him, and they must rescue his mother in order to stop this new threat, and save the future. Highly effective film is equally breathless and exciting,(if a bit too long) that picks up the story from the first in a very satisfying way, while creating its own mythology at the same time. Robert Patrick was also dead-on portraying a soulless killer cyborg, and the groundbreaking F/X are outstanding, and still hold up today. James Cameron has a knack for making sequels right!

    Movies from Terminator franchise, especially first two (The Terminator and Judgement Day) directed by James Cameron are considered by many as strong anti-nuclear films with deep message of preciousness of peace in the time where immense destructive power of modern technology if abused beyond limits can bring our civilization to destruction and human race to the brink of extinction. First movie The Terminator was made in 1984. still the time of Cold War and increased tension and competition of two superpowers - USA and USSR. That was a time of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative or so-called "Star Wars" program, last phase of Cold War period while nuclear arsenals of both superpowers were at their peak (some 60.000 American and Soviet nuclear warheads by the end of 1980s which was enough to destroy life on our planet several times over, today's American and Russian nuclear arsenals are two and half times smaller, but still enough to wipe out Earth's life two or three times). James Cameron made a movie The Terminator, first in series that represented a message of mankind faced with existential threat against nuclear weapons and any kind of madness that would bring us to the edge of survival. That element of message is also present in a second Terminator movie (Judgement Day) from 1991 (both movies talking about 3 billion casualties of nuclear war caused by Sky Net), although by then period of Cold War was over with most of the nuclear threat to mankind removed (threats of today, including those with nuclear weapons are of much different nature). But there is a deeper message of Terminator movies. It's a story that tells us about destructiveness of human nature. That element is present in all four Terminator movies (including Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines from 2003 and Terminator Salvation from 2009) and that element will probably be the basic ingredient in next Terminator movie scheduled for 2015. Destructiveness as part of human beings is so greatly shown in a scene from Terminator 2 when T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is commenting on children's game with guns (although just toys) telling to John Connor (Edward Furlong) - "It's in your nature to destroy yourselves". So, is it? If I say, it is, it would be just part of the answer. Part of the point of all Terminator movies (of which Terminator 2 Judgement Day represents pinnacle and the best one of whole franchise) is that our advanced technology served to make our lives much easier but it did n't serve to make ourselves better, and if we are still savages deep in our selves we represent threat to us and life on the planet. Or is it next step of evolution? Artificial intelligence becomes aware of itself (Sky Net) and it rises to obliterate human race it was built to serve. Exploitation of fears of some modern humans that we are going to be replaced by machines, frightening vision of the future. I can only say time will show what will be. Basic premise of Terminator movies is travel through time to change events of the future by changing what happened in the past. Topic exploited in many books and films. T-101 is either sent to kill John Connor leader of human resistance like in first Terminator or to save his life like in Terminator 2 and 3, race against time against more sinister Terminators (like T-1000 played by Robert Patrick or T-X played by Kristanna Loken). After dreaming of terrifying visions of nuclear obliteration, worst kinds of nightmares haunting her, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) carves in wood words "No Fate" meaning future is not written and its course depends on our actions. In Terminator 2, she, T-101, Miles Dyson and John Connor, her son manage to prevent nuclear war by destroying building where Sky Net was kept changing the course of the future. But as we see in Terminator 3, they only postponed something that was inevitable. In Terminator 3, T-101 is only sent to save lives of John Connor and Kate Brewster, not to change the future, because obviously it can not be changed, so there must be fate. From that point forward Terminator franchise (Terminator 4 and future Terminator 5) deals with human resistance, struggle to survive and defeat machines that lasts for decades after nuclear destruction of most of modern civilization. But the other part of the point of Terminator franchise is a message of hope. It's a story of resilience of human race, even when it faces near destruction and hopelessness mankind keeps fighting because it' s the only thing it has left, fighting for hope, for better tomorrow, for the day when it will rise again. And there is something that humans have and machines still lack - pure emotions. In the end of Terminator 2, when John Connor has to lower T-101 to liquid steel where its chip and T-101 will be destroyed which is strongest emotional scene of any Terminator movie, T-101 says to John Connor something that represents whole point of Terminator movies and message they are trying to tell us - "Now I know why you cry, but it is something I can never do".

While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute . From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films). Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (like I said, recycling at its best). But it was not just the action that had a huge evolution, but also the stunning visual effects that the film contains (and very advanced for its time). In levels of performances, Schwarzenegger after the 1st film he entered on the map, on this one he definitely gets to be the iconic face of the action genre; Linda Hamilton in the first was a fragile waitress seeing her life suffering from a huge changeover, in this one she became the human exterminator, showing that after the death of her love one she had to learn how to survive alone (and very well by the way). Many fall trying to decide which Cameron's Terminator is the best, for me is hard to say which is above the other. Both have completely different tones and many different aspects and both truly unforgettable, and both received the same title of being the best action movie ever made but Cameron showed that it could be much more than that. With superb performances, stunning visuals and breathtaking action, both "Terminators" are both classics to be remembered forever! 10/10

    Terminator 2 : Judgement Day comes with a really well power-packed action sequence. This really keeps the audience at the peak of the desk. The director makes the film more interesting and finally ends with a huge emotion. The movie overall has a very good story and really goes on well. But, at some times, the movie gets very boring, in other words, the movies gets slow int terms of the storyline. The action performed by both the protagonist and the antagonist are really good. good stunt direction in this film makes this really an awesome experience to watch. since, its a sci-fi movie, there is no need for searching for any logic.

    There are a lot of very entertaining movies out there, and everyone likes that feeling you get when the credits roll at the end of a good flick. But no matter how many times I see it, "Terminator 2" is one of the very few films that leaves me feeling something quite unusual - a sense of absolute awe. I mean, the scale of this movie! You have trucks chasing bikes, helicopters chasing trucks, shootouts, huge explosions; a liquid metal man, a nuclear holocaust, a laser battle in the future; ruminations on the nature and future of humanity; sacrifice, redemption, hope. It's just huge. The pacing is terrific: after an absolutely breakneck first hour, the audience is given time to breathe while the characters reflect on their situation in deeply ruminative scenes in the Mojave desert, before a surprising, action-packed and ultimately moving finale. The lighting and colour grading add to the impact - the many night scenes in Los Angeles are given a slick blue sheen, offering a contrast between the threatening urban environment and the warm colours of the desert. The editing is fast enough to be appropriately exciting while never becoming frenetic or confusing. The music and sound design are impeccable. The T-1000's leitmotif really heightens the creepiness of the character. The gentle acoustic guitar in the desert sequence is both beautiful and ominous, and the Main Title theme is simply one of the greatest pieces of music I've ever heard. Sound design is such an overlooked discipline: I'm certain the average moviegoer has no idea that every footstep, every engine rumble and almost every word of dialogue is replaced during post-production. Here it's perfect, and filled with nice artistic touches such as the extra reverb on Sarah's scream when she first sees Arnie. Even people who don't like this film have to agree that the effects are spectacular, and I've still never seen such convincing use of CGI. I recently found out why: in many cases, CGI was used to provide a smooth transition between real-life animatronic models of the T-1000 in various states of decimation, provided by the workshop of effects genius Stan Winston. The ethos was that if it could be done "in camera", it should - a creed I wish more film-makers followed. It just looks so much better and so much more convincing. It's surprising to find an action film so affecting. The nuclear holocaust, which inspired a reaction along the lines of "awesome" when I first saw it at thirteen, is a scene that as an adult and father I now find truly bloodcurdling and terrifying. Sarah's assassination attempt on Dyson, and John's efforts to stop her, always make a deep impression ("Haven't you figured out why you can't just go around killing people?" Quite so) and I'm not ashamed to say that I've shed a few tears watching Dyson stare into the barrel of Sarah's gun. Everything leads up to the final payoff. I get chills just thinking of the final monologue, delivered over footage of a highway at night, before the credits roll over that epic Main Title theme. It's just an astonishing piece of work, a true masterpiece, hands-down my favourite action film and in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. Two thumbs up for T2!

    Part II picks up many years later, when Sarah Connor is an inmate in a mental asylum(people did not believe her story). Her son John Connor is now a troubled boy, pursued not only by the police, but a new and more advanced Cyborg Killer, the T-1000, made of liquid metal, and seemingly unstoppable, until a familiar Cyborg shows up also in pursuit, not of John, put to protect him, and they must rescue his mother in order to stop this new threat, and save the future. Highly effective film is equally breathless and exciting,(if a bit too long) that picks up the story from the first in a very satisfying way, while creating its own mythology at the same time. Robert Patrick was also dead-on portraying a soulless killer cyborg, and the groundbreaking F/X are outstanding, and still hold up today. James Cameron has a knack for making sequels right!

    Movies from Terminator franchise, especially first two (The Terminator and Judgement Day) directed by James Cameron are considered by many as strong anti-nuclear films with deep message of preciousness of peace in the time where immense destructive power of modern technology if abused beyond limits can bring our civilization to destruction and human race to the brink of extinction. First movie The Terminator was made in 1984. still the time of Cold War and increased tension and competition of two superpowers - USA and USSR. That was a time of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative or so-called "Star Wars" program, last phase of Cold War period while nuclear arsenals of both superpowers were at their peak (some 60.000 American and Soviet nuclear warheads by the end of 1980s which was enough to destroy life on our planet several times over, today's American and Russian nuclear arsenals are two and half times smaller, but still enough to wipe out Earth's life two or three times). James Cameron made a movie The Terminator, first in series that represented a message of mankind faced with existential threat against nuclear weapons and any kind of madness that would bring us to the edge of survival. That element of message is also present in a second Terminator movie (Judgement Day) from 1991 (both movies talking about 3 billion casualties of nuclear war caused by Sky Net), although by then period of Cold War was over with most of the nuclear threat to mankind removed (threats of today, including those with nuclear weapons are of much different nature). But there is a deeper message of Terminator movies. It's a story that tells us about destructiveness of human nature. That element is present in all four Terminator movies (including Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines from 2003 and Terminator Salvation from 2009) and that element will probably be the basic ingredient in next Terminator movie scheduled for 2015. Destructiveness as part of human beings is so greatly shown in a scene from Terminator 2 when T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is commenting on children's game with guns (although just toys) telling to John Connor (Edward Furlong) - "It's in your nature to destroy yourselves". So, is it? If I say, it is, it would be just part of the answer. Part of the point of all Terminator movies (of which Terminator 2 Judgement Day represents pinnacle and the best one of whole franchise) is that our advanced technology served to make our lives much easier but it did n't serve to make ourselves better, and if we are still savages deep in our selves we represent threat to us and life on the planet. Or is it next step of evolution? Artificial intelligence becomes aware of itself (Sky Net) and it rises to obliterate human race it was built to serve. Exploitation of fears of some modern humans that we are going to be replaced by machines, frightening vision of the future. I can only say time will show what will be. Basic premise of Terminator movies is travel through time to change events of the future by changing what happened in the past. Topic exploited in many books and films. T-101 is either sent to kill John Connor leader of human resistance like in first Terminator or to save his life like in Terminator 2 and 3, race against time against more sinister Terminators (like T-1000 played by Robert Patrick or T-X played by Kristanna Loken). After dreaming of terrifying visions of nuclear obliteration, worst kinds of nightmares haunting her, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) carves in wood words "No Fate" meaning future is not written and its course depends on our actions. In Terminator 2, she, T-101, Miles Dyson and John Connor, her son manage to prevent nuclear war by destroying building where Sky Net was kept changing the course of the future. But as we see in Terminator 3, they only postponed something that was inevitable. In Terminator 3, T-101 is only sent to save lives of John Connor and Kate Brewster, not to change the future, because obviously it can not be changed, so there must be fate. From that point forward Terminator franchise (Terminator 4 and future Terminator 5) deals with human resistance, struggle to survive and defeat machines that lasts for decades after nuclear destruction of most of modern civilization. But the other part of the point of Terminator franchise is a message of hope. It's a story of resilience of human race, even when it faces near destruction and hopelessness mankind keeps fighting because it' s the only thing it has left, fighting for hope, for better tomorrow, for the day when it will rise again. And there is something that humans have and machines still lack - pure emotions. In the end of Terminator 2, when John Connor has to lower T-101 to liquid steel where its chip and T-101 will be destroyed which is strongest emotional scene of any Terminator movie, T-101 says to John Connor something that represents whole point of Terminator movies and message they are trying to tell us - "Now I know why you cry, but it is something I can never do".

    In 1995, eleven years after the events of The Terminator, John is ten years old and living in Los Angels with foster parents. His mother Sarah had been preparing him throughout his child food for his future role as the leader of the human Resistance against Skynet, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a computer factory and remembered to a hospital. First I think this movie is so cool!! It is good idea that the Terminator is support the John. And the idea that computer can disguised the person is nice idea, too. Second I liked the new terminator's running form is funny, and scared. this movie is full of thrilling.

    Though I love the Terminator series, this is my least favorite of the four movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes place about twelve years after the first movie. In this movie we find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents because Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in an asylum for trying to blow up a computer company. The graphics for this movie were far better than what the graphics for the first Terminator movie were. They ought to be, the budget was just over $100,000,000 compared to $6,500,000. That is quite a lot of difference. Anyway, even though this is my least favorite of all four movies I do have some favorite parts. But, before I list them I want to say that I could have gone a lot longer in my life with out seeing the naked asses of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. That said I think I can list my favorite scenes without ever having to reference those scenes again. My first favorite scene is when The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) walks into the road house to get clothes (oops, I'm referring to Arnold being naked). The Terminator takes out five or six bikers. One of the bikers pulls a knife and the Terminator disarms him and stabs the biker through the shoulder and pins him to the pool table. After the Terminator gets clothes and takes a motorcycle, the bartender come out to stop him with a shotgun. The Terminator disarms the bartender and takes his sunglasses, but leaves without further harm to anymore humans. My next favorite scene has to deal with when The Terminator and the T- 1000 and when they first find John Connor. The fight between the two terminators is pretty good. However, I like the chase scene through the storm canals better. The last scene I like is the scene when the T-1000 is defeated. It's a pretty drawn out elaborate fight scene that sees him fall into a vat of molten metal. Unfortunately for the Terminator, and John, that isn't the end of the movie. The Terminator must be destroyed, so he is lowered into the same vat of molten metal. I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. I didn't like how Sarah Connor was extremely butch and gung-ho, I understand it, but I didn't like it.

    In some ways, I see James Cameron and Steven Spielberg as very similar creatures. Both project expansive, extraordinary visions (Spielberg seems more caught up in character while Cameron, equally as invested, is a little more interested in expansive special effects) that while thrilling on an overall scale are often a bit too sentimental which takes away from the overall film. This is not the case with the timelessly bombastic Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Out of all of Cameron's films, the emotional aspect here is really excellent because it's subtle. A great example of this emotional subtlety is the crying scene where Arnie asks a young Edward Furlong what's wrong with his eyes. Classic. The more obvious and over-the-top scenes of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escaping a creepy treatment center are well-acted too, devoid of sentimental music. Just gritty, and unfortunate, reality here. On top of this emotional subtlety comes the action, so when the scenes intended to make the tears start rolling start rolling, the tears genuinely can start rolling. 10/10.

    I definitely prefer this to the original! I don't like calling the sequel to Terminator a better movie, but it is, to me. For Schwarzenegger fans, you will enjoy him in this. For fans of little boys (no) that invoke similar feelings of immense frustration (still no) that Carl Grimes does, you will like John Connor here. Being a child actor in 1991 shouldn't be an excuse, but there it is. Honestly, Linda Hamilton is the main reason to watch this movie, for the majority of viewers. She is insanely hot, despite being a woman with violent tendencies committed to a psychiatric facility (actually that may be part of the reason). The new terminator model is a great twist to the story, also.

    OK, that's the thing with James Cameron, when he announces something it takes almost a decade to come out (still waiting for Avatar 2 and 3). Same thing with "The Terminator: Judgment Day", after the great success of "The Terminator" Cameron received letters and desperate requests to he make a sequel and then he promised he would. 6 years have passed, Cameron had time to do the Excellent "Aliens" and the underrated "The Abyss", and finally in 1991 came this film, and every minute of the wait was worth it! "The Terminator: Judgement Day" is still considered one of the best sequels ever made, not by critics who said that was not even at the level of his predecessor, but by fans who won over the years. Cameron made both classic films totally different, and unforgettable ! The story begins 10 years after the events of the 1st movie and we found Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrested in a rehabilitation clinic accused of attacks of madness and visions with killer robots and the end of the world to come thanks to a nuclear war. On the other side of the story we have John Connor (Edward Furlong), the prodigal son of Sarah Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines, a rebellious and troublemaker boy living with adoptive parents (the characteristics of a true leader, nothing like a suffered childhood to build a strong warrior). But as in the first, a killing machine was sent to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of John, in this one a machine is sent to assassinate John, this work is now up to an advanced model of Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). But just like in the 1st film, the resistance sends someone to protect him in this one, not a beautiful blonde soldier this time but a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). In the 1st movie, Cameron picked sci - fi and action elements evolving them, here he takes on its own material and evolves it to a new level. The critics considered that a more expensive copy, but fans considered a MAGNIFICENT recycling taking everything bigger and bolder. While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute . From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films). Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (like I said, recycling at its best).

That element of message is also present in a second Terminator movie (Judgement Day) from 1991 (both movies talking about 3 billion casualties of nuclear war caused by Sky Net), although by then period of Cold War was over with most of the nuclear threat to mankind removed (threats of today, including those with nuclear weapons are of much different nature). But there is a deeper message of Terminator movies. It's a story that tells us about destructiveness of human nature. That element is present in all four Terminator movies (including Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines from 2003 and Terminator Salvation from 2009) and that element will probably be the basic ingredient in next Terminator movie scheduled for 2015. Destructiveness as part of human beings is so greatly shown in a scene from Terminator 2 when T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is commenting on children's game with guns (although just toys) telling to John Connor (Edward Furlong) - "It's in your nature to destroy yourselves". So, is it? If I say, it is, it would be just part of the answer. Part of the point of all Terminator movies (of which Terminator 2 Judgement Day represents pinnacle and the best one of whole franchise) is that our advanced technology served to make our lives much easier but it did n't serve to make ourselves better, and if we are still savages deep in our selves we represent threat to us and life on the planet. Or is it next step of evolution? Artificial intelligence becomes aware of itself (Sky Net) and it rises to obliterate human race it was built to serve. Exploitation of fears of some modern humans that we are going to be replaced by machines, frightening vision of the future. I can only say time will show what will be. Basic premise of Terminator movies is travel through time to change events of the future by changing what happened in the past. Topic exploited in many books and films. T-101 is either sent to kill John Connor leader of human resistance like in first Terminator or to save his life like in Terminator 2 and 3, race against time against more sinister Terminators (like T-1000 played by Robert Patrick or T-X played by Kristanna Loken). After dreaming of terrifying visions of nuclear obliteration, worst kinds of nightmares haunting her, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) carves in wood words "No Fate" meaning future is not written and its course depends on our actions. In Terminator 2, she, T-101, Miles Dyson and John Connor, her son manage to prevent nuclear war by destroying building where Sky Net was kept changing the course of the future. But as we see in Terminator 3, they only postponed something that was inevitable. In Terminator 3, T-101 is only sent to save lives of John Connor and Kate Brewster, not to change the future, because obviously it can not be changed, so there must be fate. From that point forward Terminator franchise (Terminator 4 and future Terminator 5) deals with human resistance, struggle to survive and defeat machines that lasts for decades after nuclear destruction of most of modern civilization. But the other part of the point of Terminator franchise is a message of hope. It's a story of resilience of human race, even when it faces near destruction and hopelessness mankind keeps fighting because it' s the only thing it has left, fighting for hope, for better tomorrow, for the day when it will rise again. And there is something that humans have and machines still lack - pure emotions. In the end of Terminator 2, when John Connor has to lower T-101 to liquid steel where its chip and T-101 will be destroyed which is strongest emotional scene of any Terminator movie, T-101 says to John Connor something that represents whole point of Terminator movies and message they are trying to tell us - "Now I know why you cry, but it is something I can never do".

    In 1995, eleven years after the events of The Terminator, John is ten years old and living in Los Angels with foster parents. His mother Sarah had been preparing him throughout his child food for his future role as the leader of the human Resistance against Skynet, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a computer factory and remembered to a hospital. First I think this movie is so cool!! It is good idea that the Terminator is support the John. And the idea that computer can disguised the person is nice idea, too. Second I liked the new terminator's running form is funny, and scared. this movie is full of thrilling.

    Though I love the Terminator series, this is my least favorite of the four movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes place about twelve years after the first movie. In this movie we find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents because Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in an asylum for trying to blow up a computer company. The graphics for this movie were far better than what the graphics for the first Terminator movie were. They ought to be, the budget was just over $100,000,000 compared to $6,500,000. That is quite a lot of difference. Anyway, even though this is my least favorite of all four movies I do have some favorite parts. But, before I list them I want to say that I could have gone a lot longer in my life with out seeing the naked asses of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. That said I think I can list my favorite scenes without ever having to reference those scenes again. My first favorite scene is when The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) walks into the road house to get clothes (oops, I'm referring to Arnold being naked). The Terminator takes out five or six bikers. One of the bikers pulls a knife and the Terminator disarms him and stabs the biker through the shoulder and pins him to the pool table. After the Terminator gets clothes and takes a motorcycle, the bartender come out to stop him with a shotgun. The Terminator disarms the bartender and takes his sunglasses, but leaves without further harm to anymore humans. My next favorite scene has to deal with when The Terminator and the T- 1000 and when they first find John Connor. The fight between the two terminators is pretty good. However, I like the chase scene through the storm canals better. The last scene I like is the scene when the T-1000 is defeated. It's a pretty drawn out elaborate fight scene that sees him fall into a vat of molten metal. Unfortunately for the Terminator, and John, that isn't the end of the movie. The Terminator must be destroyed, so he is lowered into the same vat of molten metal. I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. I didn't like how Sarah Connor was extremely butch and gung-ho, I understand it, but I didn't like it.

    In some ways, I see James Cameron and Steven Spielberg as very similar creatures. Both project expansive, extraordinary visions (Spielberg seems more caught up in character while Cameron, equally as invested, is a little more interested in expansive special effects) that while thrilling on an overall scale are often a bit too sentimental which takes away from the overall film. This is not the case with the timelessly bombastic Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Out of all of Cameron's films, the emotional aspect here is really excellent because it's subtle. A great example of this emotional subtlety is the crying scene where Arnie asks a young Edward Furlong what's wrong with his eyes. Classic. The more obvious and over-the-top scenes of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escaping a creepy treatment center are well-acted too, devoid of sentimental music. Just gritty, and unfortunate, reality here. On top of this emotional subtlety comes the action, so when the scenes intended to make the tears start rolling start rolling, the tears genuinely can start rolling. 10/10.

    I definitely prefer this to the original! I don't like calling the sequel to Terminator a better movie, but it is, to me. For Schwarzenegger fans, you will enjoy him in this. For fans of little boys (no) that invoke similar feelings of immense frustration (still no) that Carl Grimes does, you will like John Connor here. Being a child actor in 1991 shouldn't be an excuse, but there it is. Honestly, Linda Hamilton is the main reason to watch this movie, for the majority of viewers. She is insanely hot, despite being a woman with violent tendencies committed to a psychiatric facility (actually that may be part of the reason). The new terminator model is a great twist to the story, also.

    OK, that's the thing with James Cameron, when he announces something it takes almost a decade to come out (still waiting for Avatar 2 and 3). Same thing with "The Terminator: Judgment Day", after the great success of "The Terminator" Cameron received letters and desperate requests to he make a sequel and then he promised he would. 6 years have passed, Cameron had time to do the Excellent "Aliens" and the underrated "The Abyss", and finally in 1991 came this film, and every minute of the wait was worth it! "The Terminator: Judgement Day" is still considered one of the best sequels ever made, not by critics who said that was not even at the level of his predecessor, but by fans who won over the years. Cameron made both classic films totally different, and unforgettable ! The story begins 10 years after the events of the 1st movie and we found Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrested in a rehabilitation clinic accused of attacks of madness and visions with killer robots and the end of the world to come thanks to a nuclear war. On the other side of the story we have John Connor (Edward Furlong), the prodigal son of Sarah Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines, a rebellious and troublemaker boy living with adoptive parents (the characteristics of a true leader, nothing like a suffered childhood to build a strong warrior). But as in the first, a killing machine was sent to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of John, in this one a machine is sent to assassinate John, this work is now up to an advanced model of Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). But just like in the 1st film, the resistance sends someone to protect him in this one, not a beautiful blonde soldier this time but a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). In the 1st movie, Cameron picked sci - fi and action elements evolving them, here he takes on its own material and evolves it to a new level. The critics considered that a more expensive copy, but fans considered a MAGNIFICENT recycling taking everything bigger and bolder. While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute . From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films). Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (like I said, recycling at its best). But it was not just the action that had a huge evolution, but also the stunning visual effects that the film contains (and very advanced for its time). In levels of performances, Schwarzenegger after the 1st film he entered on the map, on this one he definitely gets to be the iconic face of the action genre; Linda Hamilton in the first was a fragile waitress seeing her life suffering from a huge changeover, in this one she became the human exterminator, showing that after the death of her love one she had to learn how to survive alone (and very well by the way). Many fall trying to decide which Cameron's Terminator is the best, for me is hard to say which is above the other. Both have completely different tones and many different aspects and both truly unforgettable, and both received the same title of being the best action movie ever made but Cameron showed that it could be much more than that. With superb performances, stunning visuals and breathtaking action, both "Terminators" are both classics to be remembered forever! 10/10

    Terminator 2 : Judgement Day comes with a really well power-packed action sequence. This really keeps the audience at the peak of the desk. The director makes the film more interesting and finally ends with a huge emotion. The movie overall has a very good story and really goes on well. But, at some times, the movie gets very boring, in other words, the movies gets slow int terms of the storyline. The action performed by both the protagonist and the antagonist are really good. good stunt direction in this film makes this really an awesome experience to watch. since, its a sci-fi movie, there is no need for searching for any logic.

    There are a lot of very entertaining movies out there, and everyone likes that feeling you get when the credits roll at the end of a good flick. But no matter how many times I see it, "Terminator 2" is one of the very few films that leaves me feeling something quite unusual - a sense of absolute awe. I mean, the scale of this movie! You have trucks chasing bikes, helicopters chasing trucks, shootouts, huge explosions; a liquid metal man, a nuclear holocaust, a laser battle in the future; ruminations on the nature and future of humanity; sacrifice, redemption, hope. It's just huge. The pacing is terrific: after an absolutely breakneck first hour, the audience is given time to breathe while the characters reflect on their situation in deeply ruminative scenes in the Mojave desert, before a surprising, action-packed and ultimately moving finale. The lighting and colour grading add to the impact - the many night scenes in Los Angeles are given a slick blue sheen, offering a contrast between the threatening urban environment and the warm colours of the desert. The editing is fast enough to be appropriately exciting while never becoming frenetic or confusing. The music and sound design are impeccable. The T-1000's leitmotif really heightens the creepiness of the character. The gentle acoustic guitar in the desert sequence is both beautiful and ominous, and the Main Title theme is simply one of the greatest pieces of music I've ever heard. Sound design is such an overlooked discipline: I'm certain the average moviegoer has no idea that every footstep, every engine rumble and almost every word of dialogue is replaced during post-production. Here it's perfect, and filled with nice artistic touches such as the extra reverb on Sarah's scream when she first sees Arnie. Even people who don't like this film have to agree that the effects are spectacular, and I've still never seen such convincing use of CGI. I recently found out why: in many cases, CGI was used to provide a smooth transition between real-life animatronic models of the T-1000 in various states of decimation, provided by the workshop of effects genius Stan Winston. The ethos was that if it could be done "in camera", it should - a creed I wish more film-makers followed. It just looks so much better and so much more convincing. It's surprising to find an action film so affecting. The nuclear holocaust, which inspired a reaction along the lines of "awesome" when I first saw it at thirteen, is a scene that as an adult and father I now find truly bloodcurdling and terrifying. Sarah's assassination attempt on Dyson, and John's efforts to stop her, always make a deep impression ("Haven't you figured out why you can't just go around killing people?" Quite so) and I'm not ashamed to say that I've shed a few tears watching Dyson stare into the barrel of Sarah's gun. Everything leads up to the final payoff. I get chills just thinking of the final monologue, delivered over footage of a highway at night, before the credits roll over that epic Main Title theme. It's just an astonishing piece of work, a true masterpiece, hands-down my favourite action film and in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. Two thumbs up for T2!

    Part II picks up many years later, when Sarah Connor is an inmate in a mental asylum(people did not believe her story). Her son John Connor is now a troubled boy, pursued not only by the police, but a new and more advanced Cyborg Killer, the T-1000, made of liquid metal, and seemingly unstoppable, until a familiar Cyborg shows up also in pursuit, not of John, put to protect him, and they must rescue his mother in order to stop this new threat, and save the future. Highly effective film is equally breathless and exciting,(if a bit too long) that picks up the story from the first in a very satisfying way, while creating its own mythology at the same time. Robert Patrick was also dead-on portraying a soulless killer cyborg, and the groundbreaking F/X are outstanding, and still hold up today. James Cameron has a knack for making sequels right!

    Movies from Terminator franchise, especially first two (The Terminator and Judgement Day) directed by James Cameron are considered by many as strong anti-nuclear films with deep message of preciousness of peace in the time where immense destructive power of modern technology if abused beyond limits can bring our civilization to destruction and human race to the brink of extinction. First movie The Terminator was made in 1984. still the time of Cold War and increased tension and competition of two superpowers - USA and USSR. That was a time of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative or so-called "Star Wars" program, last phase of Cold War period while nuclear arsenals of both superpowers were at their peak (some 60.000 American and Soviet nuclear warheads by the end of 1980s which was enough to destroy life on our planet several times over, today's American and Russian nuclear arsenals are two and half times smaller, but still enough to wipe out Earth's life two or three times).

Same thing with "The Terminator: Judgment Day", after the great success of "The Terminator" Cameron received letters and desperate requests to he make a sequel and then he promised he would. 6 years have passed, Cameron had time to do the Excellent "Aliens" and the underrated "The Abyss", and finally in 1991 came this film, and every minute of the wait was worth it! "The Terminator: Judgement Day" is still considered one of the best sequels ever made, not by critics who said that was not even at the level of his predecessor, but by fans who won over the years. Cameron made both classic films totally different, and unforgettable ! The story begins 10 years after the events of the 1st movie and we found Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrested in a rehabilitation clinic accused of attacks of madness and visions with killer robots and the end of the world to come thanks to a nuclear war. On the other side of the story we have John Connor (Edward Furlong), the prodigal son of Sarah Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines, a rebellious and troublemaker boy living with adoptive parents (the characteristics of a true leader, nothing like a suffered childhood to build a strong warrior). But as in the first, a killing machine was sent to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of John, in this one a machine is sent to assassinate John, this work is now up to an advanced model of Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). But just like in the 1st film, the resistance sends someone to protect him in this one, not a beautiful blonde soldier this time but a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). In the 1st movie, Cameron picked sci - fi and action elements evolving them, here he takes on its own material and evolves it to a new level. The critics considered that a more expensive copy, but fans considered a MAGNIFICENT recycling taking everything bigger and bolder. While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute . From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films). Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (like I said, recycling at its best). But it was not just the action that had a huge evolution, but also the stunning visual effects that the film contains (and very advanced for its time). In levels of performances, Schwarzenegger after the 1st film he entered on the map, on this one he definitely gets to be the iconic face of the action genre; Linda Hamilton in the first was a fragile waitress seeing her life suffering from a huge changeover, in this one she became the human exterminator, showing that after the death of her love one she had to learn how to survive alone (and very well by the way). Many fall trying to decide which Cameron's Terminator is the best, for me is hard to say which is above the other. Both have completely different tones and many different aspects and both truly unforgettable, and both received the same title of being the best action movie ever made but Cameron showed that it could be much more than that. With superb performances, stunning visuals and breathtaking action, both "Terminators" are both classics to be remembered forever! 10/10

    Terminator 2 : Judgement Day comes with a really well power-packed action sequence. This really keeps the audience at the peak of the desk. The director makes the film more interesting and finally ends with a huge emotion. The movie overall has a very good story and really goes on well. But, at some times, the movie gets very boring, in other words, the movies gets slow int terms of the storyline. The action performed by both the protagonist and the antagonist are really good. good stunt direction in this film makes this really an awesome experience to watch. since, its a sci-fi movie, there is no need for searching for any logic.

    There are a lot of very entertaining movies out there, and everyone likes that feeling you get when the credits roll at the end of a good flick. But no matter how many times I see it, "Terminator 2" is one of the very few films that leaves me feeling something quite unusual - a sense of absolute awe. I mean, the scale of this movie! You have trucks chasing bikes, helicopters chasing trucks, shootouts, huge explosions; a liquid metal man, a nuclear holocaust, a laser battle in the future; ruminations on the nature and future of humanity; sacrifice, redemption, hope. It's just huge. The pacing is terrific: after an absolutely breakneck first hour, the audience is given time to breathe while the characters reflect on their situation in deeply ruminative scenes in the Mojave desert, before a surprising, action-packed and ultimately moving finale. The lighting and colour grading add to the impact - the many night scenes in Los Angeles are given a slick blue sheen, offering a contrast between the threatening urban environment and the warm colours of the desert. The editing is fast enough to be appropriately exciting while never becoming frenetic or confusing. The music and sound design are impeccable. The T-1000's leitmotif really heightens the creepiness of the character. The gentle acoustic guitar in the desert sequence is both beautiful and ominous, and the Main Title theme is simply one of the greatest pieces of music I've ever heard. Sound design is such an overlooked discipline: I'm certain the average moviegoer has no idea that every footstep, every engine rumble and almost every word of dialogue is replaced during post-production. Here it's perfect, and filled with nice artistic touches such as the extra reverb on Sarah's scream when she first sees Arnie. Even people who don't like this film have to agree that the effects are spectacular, and I've still never seen such convincing use of CGI. I recently found out why: in many cases, CGI was used to provide a smooth transition between real-life animatronic models of the T-1000 in various states of decimation, provided by the workshop of effects genius Stan Winston. The ethos was that if it could be done "in camera", it should - a creed I wish more film-makers followed. It just looks so much better and so much more convincing. It's surprising to find an action film so affecting. The nuclear holocaust, which inspired a reaction along the lines of "awesome" when I first saw it at thirteen, is a scene that as an adult and father I now find truly bloodcurdling and terrifying. Sarah's assassination attempt on Dyson, and John's efforts to stop her, always make a deep impression ("Haven't you figured out why you can't just go around killing people?" Quite so) and I'm not ashamed to say that I've shed a few tears watching Dyson stare into the barrel of Sarah's gun. Everything leads up to the final payoff. I get chills just thinking of the final monologue, delivered over footage of a highway at night, before the credits roll over that epic Main Title theme. It's just an astonishing piece of work, a true masterpiece, hands-down my favourite action film and in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. Two thumbs up for T2!

    Part II picks up many years later, when Sarah Connor is an inmate in a mental asylum(people did not believe her story). Her son John Connor is now a troubled boy, pursued not only by the police, but a new and more advanced Cyborg Killer, the T-1000, made of liquid metal, and seemingly unstoppable, until a familiar Cyborg shows up also in pursuit, not of John, put to protect him, and they must rescue his mother in order to stop this new threat, and save the future. Highly effective film is equally breathless and exciting,(if a bit too long) that picks up the story from the first in a very satisfying way, while creating its own mythology at the same time. Robert Patrick was also dead-on portraying a soulless killer cyborg, and the groundbreaking F/X are outstanding, and still hold up today. James Cameron has a knack for making sequels right!

    Movies from Terminator franchise, especially first two (The Terminator and Judgement Day) directed by James Cameron are considered by many as strong anti-nuclear films with deep message of preciousness of peace in the time where immense destructive power of modern technology if abused beyond limits can bring our civilization to destruction and human race to the brink of extinction. First movie The Terminator was made in 1984. still the time of Cold War and increased tension and competition of two superpowers - USA and USSR. That was a time of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative or so-called "Star Wars" program, last phase of Cold War period while nuclear arsenals of both superpowers were at their peak (some 60.000 American and Soviet nuclear warheads by the end of 1980s which was enough to destroy life on our planet several times over, today's American and Russian nuclear arsenals are two and half times smaller, but still enough to wipe out Earth's life two or three times). James Cameron made a movie The Terminator, first in series that represented a message of mankind faced with existential threat against nuclear weapons and any kind of madness that would bring us to the edge of survival. That element of message is also present in a second Terminator movie (Judgement Day) from 1991 (both movies talking about 3 billion casualties of nuclear war caused by Sky Net), although by then period of Cold War was over with most of the nuclear threat to mankind removed (threats of today, including those with nuclear weapons are of much different nature). But there is a deeper message of Terminator movies. It's a story that tells us about destructiveness of human nature. That element is present in all four Terminator movies (including Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines from 2003 and Terminator Salvation from 2009) and that element will probably be the basic ingredient in next Terminator movie scheduled for 2015. Destructiveness as part of human beings is so greatly shown in a scene from Terminator 2 when T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is commenting on children's game with guns (although just toys) telling to John Connor (Edward Furlong) - "It's in your nature to destroy yourselves". So, is it? If I say, it is, it would be just part of the answer. Part of the point of all Terminator movies (of which Terminator 2 Judgement Day represents pinnacle and the best one of whole franchise) is that our advanced technology served to make our lives much easier but it did n't serve to make ourselves better, and if we are still savages deep in our selves we represent threat to us and life on the planet. Or is it next step of evolution? Artificial intelligence becomes aware of itself (Sky Net) and it rises to obliterate human race it was built to serve. Exploitation of fears of some modern humans that we are going to be replaced by machines, frightening vision of the future. I can only say time will show what will be. Basic premise of Terminator movies is travel through time to change events of the future by changing what happened in the past. Topic exploited in many books and films. T-101 is either sent to kill John Connor leader of human resistance like in first Terminator or to save his life like in Terminator 2 and 3, race against time against more sinister Terminators (like T-1000 played by Robert Patrick or T-X played by Kristanna Loken). After dreaming of terrifying visions of nuclear obliteration, worst kinds of nightmares haunting her, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) carves in wood words "No Fate" meaning future is not written and its course depends on our actions. In Terminator 2, she, T-101, Miles Dyson and John Connor, her son manage to prevent nuclear war by destroying building where Sky Net was kept changing the course of the future. But as we see in Terminator 3, they only postponed something that was inevitable. In Terminator 3, T-101 is only sent to save lives of John Connor and Kate Brewster, not to change the future, because obviously it can not be changed, so there must be fate. From that point forward Terminator franchise (Terminator 4 and future Terminator 5) deals with human resistance, struggle to survive and defeat machines that lasts for decades after nuclear destruction of most of modern civilization. But the other part of the point of Terminator franchise is a message of hope. It's a story of resilience of human race, even when it faces near destruction and hopelessness mankind keeps fighting because it' s the only thing it has left, fighting for hope, for better tomorrow, for the day when it will rise again. And there is something that humans have and machines still lack - pure emotions. In the end of Terminator 2, when John Connor has to lower T-101 to liquid steel where its chip and T-101 will be destroyed which is strongest emotional scene of any Terminator movie, T-101 says to John Connor something that represents whole point of Terminator movies and message they are trying to tell us - "Now I know why you cry, but it is something I can never do".

    In 1995, eleven years after the events of The Terminator, John is ten years old and living in Los Angels with foster parents. His mother Sarah had been preparing him throughout his child food for his future role as the leader of the human Resistance against Skynet, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a computer factory and remembered to a hospital. First I think this movie is so cool!! It is good idea that the Terminator is support the John. And the idea that computer can disguised the person is nice idea, too. Second I liked the new terminator's running form is funny, and scared. this movie is full of thrilling.

    Though I love the Terminator series, this is my least favorite of the four movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes place about twelve years after the first movie. In this movie we find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents because Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in an asylum for trying to blow up a computer company. The graphics for this movie were far better than what the graphics for the first Terminator movie were. They ought to be, the budget was just over $100,000,000 compared to $6,500,000. That is quite a lot of difference. Anyway, even though this is my least favorite of all four movies I do have some favorite parts. But, before I list them I want to say that I could have gone a lot longer in my life with out seeing the naked asses of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. That said I think I can list my favorite scenes without ever having to reference those scenes again. My first favorite scene is when The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) walks into the road house to get clothes (oops, I'm referring to Arnold being naked). The Terminator takes out five or six bikers. One of the bikers pulls a knife and the Terminator disarms him and stabs the biker through the shoulder and pins him to the pool table. After the Terminator gets clothes and takes a motorcycle, the bartender come out to stop him with a shotgun. The Terminator disarms the bartender and takes his sunglasses, but leaves without further harm to anymore humans. My next favorite scene has to deal with when The Terminator and the T- 1000 and when they first find John Connor. The fight between the two terminators is pretty good. However, I like the chase scene through the storm canals better. The last scene I like is the scene when the T-1000 is defeated. It's a pretty drawn out elaborate fight scene that sees him fall into a vat of molten metal. Unfortunately for the Terminator, and John, that isn't the end of the movie. The Terminator must be destroyed, so he is lowered into the same vat of molten metal. I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. I didn't like how Sarah Connor was extremely butch and gung-ho, I understand it, but I didn't like it.

    In some ways, I see James Cameron and Steven Spielberg as very similar creatures. Both project expansive, extraordinary visions (Spielberg seems more caught up in character while Cameron, equally as invested, is a little more interested in expansive special effects) that while thrilling on an overall scale are often a bit too sentimental which takes away from the overall film. This is not the case with the timelessly bombastic Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Out of all of Cameron's films, the emotional aspect here is really excellent because it's subtle. A great example of this emotional subtlety is the crying scene where Arnie asks a young Edward Furlong what's wrong with his eyes. Classic. The more obvious and over-the-top scenes of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escaping a creepy treatment center are well-acted too, devoid of sentimental music. Just gritty, and unfortunate, reality here. On top of this emotional subtlety comes the action, so when the scenes intended to make the tears start rolling start rolling, the tears genuinely can start rolling. 10/10.

    I definitely prefer this to the original! I don't like calling the sequel to Terminator a better movie, but it is, to me. For Schwarzenegger fans, you will enjoy him in this. For fans of little boys (no) that invoke similar feelings of immense frustration (still no) that Carl Grimes does, you will like John Connor here. Being a child actor in 1991 shouldn't be an excuse, but there it is. Honestly, Linda Hamilton is the main reason to watch this movie, for the majority of viewers. She is insanely hot, despite being a woman with violent tendencies committed to a psychiatric facility (actually that may be part of the reason). The new terminator model is a great twist to the story, also.

    Movies from Terminator franchise, especially first two (The Terminator and Judgement Day) directed by James Cameron are considered by many as strong anti-nuclear films with deep message of preciousness of peace in the time where immense destructive power of modern technology if abused beyond limits can bring our civilization to destruction and human race to the brink of extinction. First movie The Terminator was made in 1984. still the time of Cold War and increased tension and competition of two superpowers - USA and USSR. That was a time of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative or so-called "Star Wars" program, last phase of Cold War period while nuclear arsenals of both superpowers were at their peak (some 60.000 American and Soviet nuclear warheads by the end of 1980s which was enough to destroy life on our planet several times over, today's American and Russian nuclear arsenals are two and half times smaller, but still enough to wipe out Earth's life two or three times). James Cameron made a movie The Terminator, first in series that represented a message of mankind faced with existential threat against nuclear weapons and any kind of madness that would bring us to the edge of survival. That element of message is also present in a second Terminator movie (Judgement Day) from 1991 (both movies talking about 3 billion casualties of nuclear war caused by Sky Net), although by then period of Cold War was over with most of the nuclear threat to mankind removed (threats of today, including those with nuclear weapons are of much different nature). But there is a deeper message of Terminator movies. It's a story that tells us about destructiveness of human nature. That element is present in all four Terminator movies (including Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines from 2003 and Terminator Salvation from 2009) and that element will probably be the basic ingredient in next Terminator movie scheduled for 2015. Destructiveness as part of human beings is so greatly shown in a scene from Terminator 2 when T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is commenting on children's game with guns (although just toys) telling to John Connor (Edward Furlong) - "It's in your nature to destroy yourselves". So, is it? If I say, it is, it would be just part of the answer. Part of the point of all Terminator movies (of which Terminator 2 Judgement Day represents pinnacle and the best one of whole franchise) is that our advanced technology served to make our lives much easier but it did n't serve to make ourselves better, and if we are still savages deep in our selves we represent threat to us and life on the planet. Or is it next step of evolution? Artificial intelligence becomes aware of itself (Sky Net) and it rises to obliterate human race it was built to serve. Exploitation of fears of some modern humans that we are going to be replaced by machines, frightening vision of the future. I can only say time will show what will be. Basic premise of Terminator movies is travel through time to change events of the future by changing what happened in the past. Topic exploited in many books and films. T-101 is either sent to kill John Connor leader of human resistance like in first Terminator or to save his life like in Terminator 2 and 3, race against time against more sinister Terminators (like T-1000 played by Robert Patrick or T-X played by Kristanna Loken). After dreaming of terrifying visions of nuclear obliteration, worst kinds of nightmares haunting her, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) carves in wood words "No Fate" meaning future is not written and its course depends on our actions. In Terminator 2, she, T-101, Miles Dyson and John Connor, her son manage to prevent nuclear war by destroying building where Sky Net was kept changing the course of the future. But as we see in Terminator 3, they only postponed something that was inevitable. In Terminator 3, T-101 is only sent to save lives of John Connor and Kate Brewster, not to change the future, because obviously it can not be changed, so there must be fate. From that point forward Terminator franchise (Terminator 4 and future Terminator 5) deals with human resistance, struggle to survive and defeat machines that lasts for decades after nuclear destruction of most of modern civilization. But the other part of the point of Terminator franchise is a message of hope. It's a story of resilience of human race, even when it faces near destruction and hopelessness mankind keeps fighting because it' s the only thing it has left, fighting for hope, for better tomorrow, for the day when it will rise again. And there is something that humans have and machines still lack - pure emotions. In the end of Terminator 2, when John Connor has to lower T-101 to liquid steel where its chip and T-101 will be destroyed which is strongest emotional scene of any Terminator movie, T-101 says to John Connor something that represents whole point of Terminator movies and message they are trying to tell us - "Now I know why you cry, but it is something I can never do".

    In 1995, eleven years after the events of The Terminator, John is ten years old and living in Los Angels with foster parents. His mother Sarah had been preparing him throughout his child food for his future role as the leader of the human Resistance against Skynet, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a computer factory and remembered to a hospital. First I think this movie is so cool!! It is good idea that the Terminator is support the John. And the idea that computer can disguised the person is nice idea, too. Second I liked the new terminator's running form is funny, and scared. this movie is full of thrilling.

    Though I love the Terminator series, this is my least favorite of the four movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes place about twelve years after the first movie. In this movie we find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents because Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in an asylum for trying to blow up a computer company. The graphics for this movie were far better than what the graphics for the first Terminator movie were. They ought to be, the budget was just over $100,000,000 compared to $6,500,000. That is quite a lot of difference. Anyway, even though this is my least favorite of all four movies I do have some favorite parts. But, before I list them I want to say that I could have gone a lot longer in my life with out seeing the naked asses of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. That said I think I can list my favorite scenes without ever having to reference those scenes again. My first favorite scene is when The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) walks into the road house to get clothes (oops, I'm referring to Arnold being naked). The Terminator takes out five or six bikers. One of the bikers pulls a knife and the Terminator disarms him and stabs the biker through the shoulder and pins him to the pool table. After the Terminator gets clothes and takes a motorcycle, the bartender come out to stop him with a shotgun. The Terminator disarms the bartender and takes his sunglasses, but leaves without further harm to anymore humans. My next favorite scene has to deal with when The Terminator and the T- 1000 and when they first find John Connor. The fight between the two terminators is pretty good. However, I like the chase scene through the storm canals better. The last scene I like is the scene when the T-1000 is defeated. It's a pretty drawn out elaborate fight scene that sees him fall into a vat of molten metal. Unfortunately for the Terminator, and John, that isn't the end of the movie. The Terminator must be destroyed, so he is lowered into the same vat of molten metal. I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. I didn't like how Sarah Connor was extremely butch and gung-ho, I understand it, but I didn't like it.

    In some ways, I see James Cameron and Steven Spielberg as very similar creatures. Both project expansive, extraordinary visions (Spielberg seems more caught up in character while Cameron, equally as invested, is a little more interested in expansive special effects) that while thrilling on an overall scale are often a bit too sentimental which takes away from the overall film. This is not the case with the timelessly bombastic Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Out of all of Cameron's films, the emotional aspect here is really excellent because it's subtle. A great example of this emotional subtlety is the crying scene where Arnie asks a young Edward Furlong what's wrong with his eyes. Classic. The more obvious and over-the-top scenes of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escaping a creepy treatment center are well-acted too, devoid of sentimental music. Just gritty, and unfortunate, reality here. On top of this emotional subtlety comes the action, so when the scenes intended to make the tears start rolling start rolling, the tears genuinely can start rolling. 10/10.

    I definitely prefer this to the original! I don't like calling the sequel to Terminator a better movie, but it is, to me. For Schwarzenegger fans, you will enjoy him in this. For fans of little boys (no) that invoke similar feelings of immense frustration (still no) that Carl Grimes does, you will like John Connor here. Being a child actor in 1991 shouldn't be an excuse, but there it is. Honestly, Linda Hamilton is the main reason to watch this movie, for the majority of viewers. She is insanely hot, despite being a woman with violent tendencies committed to a psychiatric facility (actually that may be part of the reason). The new terminator model is a great twist to the story, also.

    OK, that's the thing with James Cameron, when he announces something it takes almost a decade to come out (still waiting for Avatar 2 and 3). Same thing with "The Terminator: Judgment Day", after the great success of "The Terminator" Cameron received letters and desperate requests to he make a sequel and then he promised he would. 6 years have passed, Cameron had time to do the Excellent "Aliens" and the underrated "The Abyss", and finally in 1991 came this film, and every minute of the wait was worth it! "The Terminator: Judgement Day" is still considered one of the best sequels ever made, not by critics who said that was not even at the level of his predecessor, but by fans who won over the years. Cameron made both classic films totally different, and unforgettable ! The story begins 10 years after the events of the 1st movie and we found Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrested in a rehabilitation clinic accused of attacks of madness and visions with killer robots and the end of the world to come thanks to a nuclear war. On the other side of the story we have John Connor (Edward Furlong), the prodigal son of Sarah Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines, a rebellious and troublemaker boy living with adoptive parents (the characteristics of a true leader, nothing like a suffered childhood to build a strong warrior). But as in the first, a killing machine was sent to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of John, in this one a machine is sent to assassinate John, this work is now up to an advanced model of Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). But just like in the 1st film, the resistance sends someone to protect him in this one, not a beautiful blonde soldier this time but a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). In the 1st movie, Cameron picked sci - fi and action elements evolving them, here he takes on its own material and evolves it to a new level. The critics considered that a more expensive copy, but fans considered a MAGNIFICENT recycling taking everything bigger and bolder. While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute . From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films). Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (like I said, recycling at its best). But it was not just the action that had a huge evolution, but also the stunning visual effects that the film contains (and very advanced for its time). In levels of performances, Schwarzenegger after the 1st film he entered on the map, on this one he definitely gets to be the iconic face of the action genre; Linda Hamilton in the first was a fragile waitress seeing her life suffering from a huge changeover, in this one she became the human exterminator, showing that after the death of her love one she had to learn how to survive alone (and very well by the way). Many fall trying to decide which Cameron's Terminator is the best, for me is hard to say which is above the other. Both have completely different tones and many different aspects and both truly unforgettable, and both received the same title of being the best action movie ever made but Cameron showed that it could be much more than that. With superb performances, stunning visuals and breathtaking action, both "Terminators" are both classics to be remembered forever! 10/10

    Terminator 2 : Judgement Day comes with a really well power-packed action sequence. This really keeps the audience at the peak of the desk. The director makes the film more interesting and finally ends with a huge emotion. The movie overall has a very good story and really goes on well. But, at some times, the movie gets very boring, in other words, the movies gets slow int terms of the storyline. The action performed by both the protagonist and the antagonist are really good. good stunt direction in this film makes this really an awesome experience to watch. since, its a sci-fi movie, there is no need for searching for any logic.

    There are a lot of very entertaining movies out there, and everyone likes that feeling you get when the credits roll at the end of a good flick. But no matter how many times I see it, "Terminator 2" is one of the very few films that leaves me feeling something quite unusual - a sense of absolute awe. I mean, the scale of this movie! You have trucks chasing bikes, helicopters chasing trucks, shootouts, huge explosions; a liquid metal man, a nuclear holocaust, a laser battle in the future; ruminations on the nature and future of humanity; sacrifice, redemption, hope. It's just huge. The pacing is terrific: after an absolutely breakneck first hour, the audience is given time to breathe while the characters reflect on their situation in deeply ruminative scenes in the Mojave desert, before a surprising, action-packed and ultimately moving finale. The lighting and colour grading add to the impact - the many night scenes in Los Angeles are given a slick blue sheen, offering a contrast between the threatening urban environment and the warm colours of the desert. The editing is fast enough to be appropriately exciting while never becoming frenetic or confusing. The music and sound design are impeccable. The T-1000's leitmotif really heightens the creepiness of the character. The gentle acoustic guitar in the desert sequence is both beautiful and ominous, and the Main Title theme is simply one of the greatest pieces of music I've ever heard. Sound design is such an overlooked discipline: I'm certain the average moviegoer has no idea that every footstep, every engine rumble and almost every word of dialogue is replaced during post-production. Here it's perfect, and filled with nice artistic touches such as the extra reverb on Sarah's scream when she first sees Arnie. Even people who don't like this film have to agree that the effects are spectacular, and I've still never seen such convincing use of CGI. I recently found out why: in many cases, CGI was used to provide a smooth transition between real-life animatronic models of the T-1000 in various states of decimation, provided by the workshop of effects genius Stan Winston. The ethos was that if it could be done "in camera", it should - a creed I wish more film-makers followed. It just looks so much better and so much more convincing. It's surprising to find an action film so affecting. The nuclear holocaust, which inspired a reaction along the lines of "awesome" when I first saw it at thirteen, is a scene that as an adult and father I now find truly bloodcurdling and terrifying. Sarah's assassination attempt on Dyson, and John's efforts to stop her, always make a deep impression ("Haven't you figured out why you can't just go around killing people?" Quite so) and I'm not ashamed to say that I've shed a few tears watching Dyson stare into the barrel of Sarah's gun. Everything leads up to the final payoff. I get chills just thinking of the final monologue, delivered over footage of a highway at night, before the credits roll over that epic Main Title theme. It's just an astonishing piece of work, a true masterpiece, hands-down my favourite action film and in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. Two thumbs up for T2!

    Part II picks up many years later, when Sarah Connor is an inmate in a mental asylum(people did not believe her story). Her son John Connor is now a troubled boy, pursued not only by the police, but a new and more advanced Cyborg Killer, the T-1000, made of liquid metal, and seemingly unstoppable, until a familiar Cyborg shows up also in pursuit, not of John, put to protect him, and they must rescue his mother in order to stop this new threat, and save the future. Highly effective film is equally breathless and exciting,(if a bit too long) that picks up the story from the first in a very satisfying way, while creating its own mythology at the same time. Robert Patrick was also dead-on portraying a soulless killer cyborg, and the groundbreaking F/X are outstanding, and still hold up today. James Cameron has a knack for making sequels right!

    OK, that's the thing with James Cameron, when he announces something it takes almost a decade to come out (still waiting for Avatar 2 and 3). Same thing with "The Terminator: Judgment Day", after the great success of "The Terminator" Cameron received letters and desperate requests to he make a sequel and then he promised he would. 6 years have passed, Cameron had time to do the Excellent "Aliens" and the underrated "The Abyss", and finally in 1991 came this film, and every minute of the wait was worth it! "The Terminator: Judgement Day" is still considered one of the best sequels ever made, not by critics who said that was not even at the level of his predecessor, but by fans who won over the years. Cameron made both classic films totally different, and unforgettable ! The story begins 10 years after the events of the 1st movie and we found Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrested in a rehabilitation clinic accused of attacks of madness and visions with killer robots and the end of the world to come thanks to a nuclear war. On the other side of the story we have John Connor (Edward Furlong), the prodigal son of Sarah Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines, a rebellious and troublemaker boy living with adoptive parents (the characteristics of a true leader, nothing like a suffered childhood to build a strong warrior). But as in the first, a killing machine was sent to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of John, in this one a machine is sent to assassinate John, this work is now up to an advanced model of Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). But just like in the 1st film, the resistance sends someone to protect him in this one, not a beautiful blonde soldier this time but a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). In the 1st movie, Cameron picked sci - fi and action elements evolving them, here he takes on its own material and evolves it to a new level. The critics considered that a more expensive copy, but fans considered a MAGNIFICENT recycling taking everything bigger and bolder. While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute . From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films). Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (like I said, recycling at its best). But it was not just the action that had a huge evolution, but also the stunning visual effects that the film contains (and very advanced for its time). In levels of performances, Schwarzenegger after the 1st film he entered on the map, on this one he definitely gets to be the iconic face of the action genre; Linda Hamilton in the first was a fragile waitress seeing her life suffering from a huge changeover, in this one she became the human exterminator, showing that after the death of her love one she had to learn how to survive alone (and very well by the way). Many fall trying to decide which Cameron's Terminator is the best, for me is hard to say which is above the other. Both have completely different tones and many different aspects and both truly unforgettable, and both received the same title of being the best action movie ever made but Cameron showed that it could be much more than that. With superb performances, stunning visuals and breathtaking action, both "Terminators" are both classics to be remembered forever! 10/10

    Terminator 2 : Judgement Day comes with a really well power-packed action sequence. This really keeps the audience at the peak of the desk. The director makes the film more interesting and finally ends with a huge emotion. The movie overall has a very good story and really goes on well. But, at some times, the movie gets very boring, in other words, the movies gets slow int terms of the storyline. The action performed by both the protagonist and the antagonist are really good. good stunt direction in this film makes this really an awesome experience to watch. since, its a sci-fi movie, there is no need for searching for any logic.

    There are a lot of very entertaining movies out there, and everyone likes that feeling you get when the credits roll at the end of a good flick. But no matter how many times I see it, "Terminator 2" is one of the very few films that leaves me feeling something quite unusual - a sense of absolute awe. I mean, the scale of this movie! You have trucks chasing bikes, helicopters chasing trucks, shootouts, huge explosions; a liquid metal man, a nuclear holocaust, a laser battle in the future; ruminations on the nature and future of humanity; sacrifice, redemption, hope. It's just huge. The pacing is terrific: after an absolutely breakneck first hour, the audience is given time to breathe while the characters reflect on their situation in deeply ruminative scenes in the Mojave desert, before a surprising, action-packed and ultimately moving finale. The lighting and colour grading add to the impact - the many night scenes in Los Angeles are given a slick blue sheen, offering a contrast between the threatening urban environment and the warm colours of the desert. The editing is fast enough to be appropriately exciting while never becoming frenetic or confusing. The music and sound design are impeccable. The T-1000's leitmotif really heightens the creepiness of the character. The gentle acoustic guitar in the desert sequence is both beautiful and ominous, and the Main Title theme is simply one of the greatest pieces of music I've ever heard. Sound design is such an overlooked discipline: I'm certain the average moviegoer has no idea that every footstep, every engine rumble and almost every word of dialogue is replaced during post-production. Here it's perfect, and filled with nice artistic touches such as the extra reverb on Sarah's scream when she first sees Arnie. Even people who don't like this film have to agree that the effects are spectacular, and I've still never seen such convincing use of CGI. I recently found out why: in many cases, CGI was used to provide a smooth transition between real-life animatronic models of the T-1000 in various states of decimation, provided by the workshop of effects genius Stan Winston. The ethos was that if it could be done "in camera", it should - a creed I wish more film-makers followed. It just looks so much better and so much more convincing. It's surprising to find an action film so affecting. The nuclear holocaust, which inspired a reaction along the lines of "awesome" when I first saw it at thirteen, is a scene that as an adult and father I now find truly bloodcurdling and terrifying. Sarah's assassination attempt on Dyson, and John's efforts to stop her, always make a deep impression ("Haven't you figured out why you can't just go around killing people?" Quite so) and I'm not ashamed to say that I've shed a few tears watching Dyson stare into the barrel of Sarah's gun. Everything leads up to the final payoff. I get chills just thinking of the final monologue, delivered over footage of a highway at night, before the credits roll over that epic Main Title theme. It's just an astonishing piece of work, a true masterpiece, hands-down my favourite action film and in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. Two thumbs up for T2!

    Part II picks up many years later, when Sarah Connor is an inmate in a mental asylum(people did not believe her story). Her son John Connor is now a troubled boy, pursued not only by the police, but a new and more advanced Cyborg Killer, the T-1000, made of liquid metal, and seemingly unstoppable, until a familiar Cyborg shows up also in pursuit, not of John, put to protect him, and they must rescue his mother in order to stop this new threat, and save the future. Highly effective film is equally breathless and exciting,(if a bit too long) that picks up the story from the first in a very satisfying way, while creating its own mythology at the same time. Robert Patrick was also dead-on portraying a soulless killer cyborg, and the groundbreaking F/X are outstanding, and still hold up today. James Cameron has a knack for making sequels right!

    Movies from Terminator franchise, especially first two (The Terminator and Judgement Day) directed by James Cameron are considered by many as strong anti-nuclear films with deep message of preciousness of peace in the time where immense destructive power of modern technology if abused beyond limits can bring our civilization to destruction and human race to the brink of extinction. First movie The Terminator was made in 1984. still the time of Cold War and increased tension and competition of two superpowers - USA and USSR. That was a time of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative or so-called "Star Wars" program, last phase of Cold War period while nuclear arsenals of both superpowers were at their peak (some 60.000 American and Soviet nuclear warheads by the end of 1980s which was enough to destroy life on our planet several times over, today's American and Russian nuclear arsenals are two and half times smaller, but still enough to wipe out Earth's life two or three times). James Cameron made a movie The Terminator, first in series that represented a message of mankind faced with existential threat against nuclear weapons and any kind of madness that would bring us to the edge of survival. That element of message is also present in a second Terminator movie (Judgement Day) from 1991 (both movies talking about 3 billion casualties of nuclear war caused by Sky Net), although by then period of Cold War was over with most of the nuclear threat to mankind removed (threats of today, including those with nuclear weapons are of much different nature). But there is a deeper message of Terminator movies. It's a story that tells us about destructiveness of human nature. That element is present in all four Terminator movies (including Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines from 2003 and Terminator Salvation from 2009) and that element will probably be the basic ingredient in next Terminator movie scheduled for 2015. Destructiveness as part of human beings is so greatly shown in a scene from Terminator 2 when T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is commenting on children's game with guns (although just toys) telling to John Connor (Edward Furlong) - "It's in your nature to destroy yourselves". So, is it? If I say, it is, it would be just part of the answer. Part of the point of all Terminator movies (of which Terminator 2 Judgement Day represents pinnacle and the best one of whole franchise) is that our advanced technology served to make our lives much easier but it did n't serve to make ourselves better, and if we are still savages deep in our selves we represent threat to us and life on the planet. Or is it next step of evolution? Artificial intelligence becomes aware of itself (Sky Net) and it rises to obliterate human race it was built to serve. Exploitation of fears of some modern humans that we are going to be replaced by machines, frightening vision of the future. I can only say time will show what will be. Basic premise of Terminator movies is travel through time to change events of the future by changing what happened in the past. Topic exploited in many books and films. T-101 is either sent to kill John Connor leader of human resistance like in first Terminator or to save his life like in Terminator 2 and 3, race against time against more sinister Terminators (like T-1000 played by Robert Patrick or T-X played by Kristanna Loken). After dreaming of terrifying visions of nuclear obliteration, worst kinds of nightmares haunting her, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) carves in wood words "No Fate" meaning future is not written and its course depends on our actions. In Terminator 2, she, T-101, Miles Dyson and John Connor, her son manage to prevent nuclear war by destroying building where Sky Net was kept changing the course of the future. But as we see in Terminator 3, they only postponed something that was inevitable. In Terminator 3, T-101 is only sent to save lives of John Connor and Kate Brewster, not to change the future, because obviously it can not be changed, so there must be fate. From that point forward Terminator franchise (Terminator 4 and future Terminator 5) deals with human resistance, struggle to survive and defeat machines that lasts for decades after nuclear destruction of most of modern civilization. But the other part of the point of Terminator franchise is a message of hope. It's a story of resilience of human race, even when it faces near destruction and hopelessness mankind keeps fighting because it' s the only thing it has left, fighting for hope, for better tomorrow, for the day when it will rise again. And there is something that humans have and machines still lack - pure emotions. In the end of Terminator 2, when John Connor has to lower T-101 to liquid steel where its chip and T-101 will be destroyed which is strongest emotional scene of any Terminator movie, T-101 says to John Connor something that represents whole point of Terminator movies and message they are trying to tell us - "Now I know why you cry, but it is something I can never do".

    In 1995, eleven years after the events of The Terminator, John is ten years old and living in Los Angels with foster parents. His mother Sarah had been preparing him throughout his child food for his future role as the leader of the human Resistance against Skynet, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a computer factory and remembered to a hospital. First I think this movie is so cool!! It is good idea that the Terminator is support the John. And the idea that computer can disguised the person is nice idea, too. Second I liked the new terminator's running form is funny, and scared. this movie is full of thrilling.

    Though I love the Terminator series, this is my least favorite of the four movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes place about twelve years after the first movie. In this movie we find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents because Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in an asylum for trying to blow up a computer company. The graphics for this movie were far better than what the graphics for the first Terminator movie were. They ought to be, the budget was just over $100,000,000 compared to $6,500,000. That is quite a lot of difference. Anyway, even though this is my least favorite of all four movies I do have some favorite parts. But, before I list them I want to say that I could have gone a lot longer in my life with out seeing the naked asses of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. That said I think I can list my favorite scenes without ever having to reference those scenes again. My first favorite scene is when The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) walks into the road house to get clothes (oops, I'm referring to Arnold being naked). The Terminator takes out five or six bikers. One of the bikers pulls a knife and the Terminator disarms him and stabs the biker through the shoulder and pins him to the pool table. After the Terminator gets clothes and takes a motorcycle, the bartender come out to stop him with a shotgun. The Terminator disarms the bartender and takes his sunglasses, but leaves without further harm to anymore humans. My next favorite scene has to deal with when The Terminator and the T- 1000 and when they first find John Connor. The fight between the two terminators is pretty good. However, I like the chase scene through the storm canals better. The last scene I like is the scene when the T-1000 is defeated. It's a pretty drawn out elaborate fight scene that sees him fall into a vat of molten metal. Unfortunately for the Terminator, and John, that isn't the end of the movie. The Terminator must be destroyed, so he is lowered into the same vat of molten metal. I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. I didn't like how Sarah Connor was extremely butch and gung-ho, I understand it, but I didn't like it.

    In some ways, I see James Cameron and Steven Spielberg as very similar creatures. Both project expansive, extraordinary visions (Spielberg seems more caught up in character while Cameron, equally as invested, is a little more interested in expansive special effects) that while thrilling on an overall scale are often a bit too sentimental which takes away from the overall film. This is not the case with the timelessly bombastic Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Out of all of Cameron's films, the emotional aspect here is really excellent because it's subtle. A great example of this emotional subtlety is the crying scene where Arnie asks a young Edward Furlong what's wrong with his eyes. Classic. The more obvious and over-the-top scenes of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escaping a creepy treatment center are well-acted too, devoid of sentimental music. Just gritty, and unfortunate, reality here. On top of this emotional subtlety comes the action, so when the scenes intended to make the tears start rolling start rolling, the tears genuinely can start rolling. 10/10.

    I definitely prefer this to the original! I don't like calling the sequel to Terminator a better movie, but it is, to me. For Schwarzenegger fans, you will enjoy him in this. For fans of little boys (no) that invoke similar feelings of immense frustration (still no) that Carl Grimes does, you will like John Connor here. Being a child actor in 1991 shouldn't be an excuse, but there it is. Honestly, Linda Hamilton is the main reason to watch this movie, for the majority of viewers. She is insanely hot, despite being a woman with violent tendencies committed to a psychiatric facility (actually that may be part of the reason). The new terminator model is a great twist to the story, also.

    Movies from Terminator franchise, especially first two (The Terminator and Judgement Day) directed by James Cameron are considered by many as strong anti-nuclear films with deep message of preciousness of peace in the time where immense destructive power of modern technology if abused beyond limits can bring our civilization to destruction and human race to the brink of extinction. First movie The Terminator was made in 1984. still the time of Cold War and increased tension and competition of two superpowers - USA and USSR. That was a time of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative or so-called "Star Wars" program, last phase of Cold War period while nuclear arsenals of both superpowers were at their peak (some 60.000 American and Soviet nuclear warheads by the end of 1980s which was enough to destroy life on our planet several times over, today's American and Russian nuclear arsenals are two and half times smaller, but still enough to wipe out Earth's life two or three times). James Cameron made a movie The Terminator, first in series that represented a message of mankind faced with existential threat against nuclear weapons and any kind of madness that would bring us to the edge of survival. That element of message is also present in a second Terminator movie (Judgement Day) from 1991 (both movies talking about 3 billion casualties of nuclear war caused by Sky Net), although by then period of Cold War was over with most of the nuclear threat to mankind removed (threats of today, including those with nuclear weapons are of much different nature). But there is a deeper message of Terminator movies. It's a story that tells us about destructiveness of human nature. That element is present in all four Terminator movies (including Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines from 2003 and Terminator Salvation from 2009) and that element will probably be the basic ingredient in next Terminator movie scheduled for 2015. Destructiveness as part of human beings is so greatly shown in a scene from Terminator 2 when T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is commenting on children's game with guns (although just toys) telling to John Connor (Edward Furlong) - "It's in your nature to destroy yourselves". So, is it? If I say, it is, it would be just part of the answer. Part of the point of all Terminator movies (of which Terminator 2 Judgement Day represents pinnacle and the best one of whole franchise) is that our advanced technology served to make our lives much easier but it did n't serve to make ourselves better, and if we are still savages deep in our selves we represent threat to us and life on the planet. Or is it next step of evolution? Artificial intelligence becomes aware of itself (Sky Net) and it rises to obliterate human race it was built to serve. Exploitation of fears of some modern humans that we are going to be replaced by machines, frightening vision of the future. I can only say time will show what will be. Basic premise of Terminator movies is travel through time to change events of the future by changing what happened in the past. Topic exploited in many books and films. T-101 is either sent to kill John Connor leader of human resistance like in first Terminator or to save his life like in Terminator 2 and 3, race against time against more sinister Terminators (like T-1000 played by Robert Patrick or T-X played by Kristanna Loken). After dreaming of terrifying visions of nuclear obliteration, worst kinds of nightmares haunting her, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) carves in wood words "No Fate" meaning future is not written and its course depends on our actions. In Terminator 2, she, T-101, Miles Dyson and John Connor, her son manage to prevent nuclear war by destroying building where Sky Net was kept changing the course of the future. But as we see in Terminator 3, they only postponed something that was inevitable. In Terminator 3, T-101 is only sent to save lives of John Connor and Kate Brewster, not to change the future, because obviously it can not be changed, so there must be fate. From that point forward Terminator franchise (Terminator 4 and future Terminator 5) deals with human resistance, struggle to survive and defeat machines that lasts for decades after nuclear destruction of most of modern civilization. But the other part of the point of Terminator franchise is a message of hope. It's a story of resilience of human race, even when it faces near destruction and hopelessness mankind keeps fighting because it' s the only thing it has left, fighting for hope, for better tomorrow, for the day when it will rise again. And there is something that humans have and machines still lack - pure emotions. In the end of Terminator 2, when John Connor has to lower T-101 to liquid steel where its chip and T-101 will be destroyed which is strongest emotional scene of any Terminator movie, T-101 says to John Connor something that represents whole point of Terminator movies and message they are trying to tell us - "Now I know why you cry, but it is something I can never do".

    In 1995, eleven years after the events of The Terminator, John is ten years old and living in Los Angels with foster parents. His mother Sarah had been preparing him throughout his child food for his future role as the leader of the human Resistance against Skynet, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a computer factory and remembered to a hospital. First I think this movie is so cool!! It is good idea that the Terminator is support the John. And the idea that computer can disguised the person is nice idea, too. Second I liked the new terminator's running form is funny, and scared. this movie is full of thrilling.

    Though I love the Terminator series, this is my least favorite of the four movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes place about twelve years after the first movie. In this movie we find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents because Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in an asylum for trying to blow up a computer company. The graphics for this movie were far better than what the graphics for the first Terminator movie were. They ought to be, the budget was just over $100,000,000 compared to $6,500,000. That is quite a lot of difference. Anyway, even though this is my least favorite of all four movies I do have some favorite parts. But, before I list them I want to say that I could have gone a lot longer in my life with out seeing the naked asses of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. That said I think I can list my favorite scenes without ever having to reference those scenes again. My first favorite scene is when The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) walks into the road house to get clothes (oops, I'm referring to Arnold being naked). The Terminator takes out five or six bikers. One of the bikers pulls a knife and the Terminator disarms him and stabs the biker through the shoulder and pins him to the pool table. After the Terminator gets clothes and takes a motorcycle, the bartender come out to stop him with a shotgun. The Terminator disarms the bartender and takes his sunglasses, but leaves without further harm to anymore humans. My next favorite scene has to deal with when The Terminator and the T- 1000 and when they first find John Connor. The fight between the two terminators is pretty good. However, I like the chase scene through the storm canals better. The last scene I like is the scene when the T-1000 is defeated. It's a pretty drawn out elaborate fight scene that sees him fall into a vat of molten metal. Unfortunately for the Terminator, and John, that isn't the end of the movie. The Terminator must be destroyed, so he is lowered into the same vat of molten metal. I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. I didn't like how Sarah Connor was extremely butch and gung-ho, I understand it, but I didn't like it.

    In some ways, I see James Cameron and Steven Spielberg as very similar creatures. Both project expansive, extraordinary visions (Spielberg seems more caught up in character while Cameron, equally as invested, is a little more interested in expansive special effects) that while thrilling on an overall scale are often a bit too sentimental which takes away from the overall film. This is not the case with the timelessly bombastic Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Out of all of Cameron's films, the emotional aspect here is really excellent because it's subtle. A great example of this emotional subtlety is the crying scene where Arnie asks a young Edward Furlong what's wrong with his eyes. Classic. The more obvious and over-the-top scenes of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escaping a creepy treatment center are well-acted too, devoid of sentimental music. Just gritty, and unfortunate, reality here. On top of this emotional subtlety comes the action, so when the scenes intended to make the tears start rolling start rolling, the tears genuinely can start rolling. 10/10.

    I definitely prefer this to the original! I don't like calling the sequel to Terminator a better movie, but it is, to me. For Schwarzenegger fans, you will enjoy him in this. For fans of little boys (no) that invoke similar feelings of immense frustration (still no) that Carl Grimes does, you will like John Connor here. Being a child actor in 1991 shouldn't be an excuse, but there it is. Honestly, Linda Hamilton is the main reason to watch this movie, for the majority of viewers. She is insanely hot, despite being a woman with violent tendencies committed to a psychiatric facility (actually that may be part of the reason). The new terminator model is a great twist to the story, also.

    OK, that's the thing with James Cameron, when he announces something it takes almost a decade to come out (still waiting for Avatar 2 and 3). Same thing with "The Terminator: Judgment Day", after the great success of "The Terminator" Cameron received letters and desperate requests to he make a sequel and then he promised he would. 6 years have passed, Cameron had time to do the Excellent "Aliens" and the underrated "The Abyss", and finally in 1991 came this film, and every minute of the wait was worth it! "The Terminator: Judgement Day" is still considered one of the best sequels ever made, not by critics who said that was not even at the level of his predecessor, but by fans who won over the years. Cameron made both classic films totally different, and unforgettable ! The story begins 10 years after the events of the 1st movie and we found Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrested in a rehabilitation clinic accused of attacks of madness and visions with killer robots and the end of the world to come thanks to a nuclear war. On the other side of the story we have John Connor (Edward Furlong), the prodigal son of Sarah Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines, a rebellious and troublemaker boy living with adoptive parents (the characteristics of a true leader, nothing like a suffered childhood to build a strong warrior). But as in the first, a killing machine was sent to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of John, in this one a machine is sent to assassinate John, this work is now up to an advanced model of Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). But just like in the 1st film, the resistance sends someone to protect him in this one, not a beautiful blonde soldier this time but a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). In the 1st movie, Cameron picked sci - fi and action elements evolving them, here he takes on its own material and evolves it to a new level. The critics considered that a more expensive copy, but fans considered a MAGNIFICENT recycling taking everything bigger and bolder. While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute . From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films). Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (like I said, recycling at its best). But it was not just the action that had a huge evolution, but also the stunning visual effects that the film contains (and very advanced for its time). In levels of performances, Schwarzenegger after the 1st film he entered on the map, on this one he definitely gets to be the iconic face of the action genre; Linda Hamilton in the first was a fragile waitress seeing her life suffering from a huge changeover, in this one she became the human exterminator, showing that after the death of her love one she had to learn how to survive alone (and very well by the way). Many fall trying to decide which Cameron's Terminator is the best, for me is hard to say which is above the other. Both have completely different tones and many different aspects and both truly unforgettable, and both received the same title of being the best action movie ever made but Cameron showed that it could be much more than that. With superb performances, stunning visuals and breathtaking action, both "Terminators" are both classics to be remembered forever! 10/10

    Terminator 2 : Judgement Day comes with a really well power-packed action sequence. This really keeps the audience at the peak of the desk. The director makes the film more interesting and finally ends with a huge emotion. The movie overall has a very good story and really goes on well. But, at some times, the movie gets very boring, in other words, the movies gets slow int terms of the storyline. The action performed by both the protagonist and the antagonist are really good. good stunt direction in this film makes this really an awesome experience to watch. since, its a sci-fi movie, there is no need for searching for any logic.

    There are a lot of very entertaining movies out there, and everyone likes that feeling you get when the credits roll at the end of a good flick. But no matter how many times I see it, "Terminator 2" is one of the very few films that leaves me feeling something quite unusual - a sense of absolute awe. I mean, the scale of this movie! You have trucks chasing bikes, helicopters chasing trucks, shootouts, huge explosions; a liquid metal man, a nuclear holocaust, a laser battle in the future; ruminations on the nature and future of humanity; sacrifice, redemption, hope. It's just huge. The pacing is terrific: after an absolutely breakneck first hour, the audience is given time to breathe while the characters reflect on their situation in deeply ruminative scenes in the Mojave desert, before a surprising, action-packed and ultimately moving finale. The lighting and colour grading add to the impact - the many night scenes in Los Angeles are given a slick blue sheen, offering a contrast between the threatening urban environment and the warm colours of the desert. The editing is fast enough to be appropriately exciting while never becoming frenetic or confusing. The music and sound design are impeccable. The T-1000's leitmotif really heightens the creepiness of the character. The gentle acoustic guitar in the desert sequence is both beautiful and ominous, and the Main Title theme is simply one of the greatest pieces of music I've ever heard. Sound design is such an overlooked discipline: I'm certain the average moviegoer has no idea that every footstep, every engine rumble and almost every word of dialogue is replaced during post-production. Here it's perfect, and filled with nice artistic touches such as the extra reverb on Sarah's scream when she first sees Arnie. Even people who don't like this film have to agree that the effects are spectacular, and I've still never seen such convincing use of CGI. I recently found out why: in many cases, CGI was used to provide a smooth transition between real-life animatronic models of the T-1000 in various states of decimation, provided by the workshop of effects genius Stan Winston. The ethos was that if it could be done "in camera", it should - a creed I wish more film-makers followed. It just looks so much better and so much more convincing. It's surprising to find an action film so affecting. The nuclear holocaust, which inspired a reaction along the lines of "awesome" when I first saw it at thirteen, is a scene that as an adult and father I now find truly bloodcurdling and terrifying. Sarah's assassination attempt on Dyson, and John's efforts to stop her, always make a deep impression ("Haven't you figured out why you can't just go around killing people?" Quite so) and I'm not ashamed to say that I've shed a few tears watching Dyson stare into the barrel of Sarah's gun. Everything leads up to the final payoff. I get chills just thinking of the final monologue, delivered over footage of a highway at night, before the credits roll over that epic Main Title theme. It's just an astonishing piece of work, a true masterpiece, hands-down my favourite action film and in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. Two thumbs up for T2!

    Part II picks up many years later, when Sarah Connor is an inmate in a mental asylum(people did not believe her story). Her son John Connor is now a troubled boy, pursued not only by the police, but a new and more advanced Cyborg Killer, the T-1000, made of liquid metal, and seemingly unstoppable, until a familiar Cyborg shows up also in pursuit, not of John, put to protect him, and they must rescue his mother in order to stop this new threat, and save the future. Highly effective film is equally breathless and exciting,(if a bit too long) that picks up the story from the first in a very satisfying way, while creating its own mythology at the same time. Robert Patrick was also dead-on portraying a soulless killer cyborg, and the groundbreaking F/X are outstanding, and still hold up today. James Cameron has a knack for making sequels right!
