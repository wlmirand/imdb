 <sinopse>
  Vampire Count Orlok expresses interest in a new residence and real estate agent Hutter's wife. Silent classic based on the story "Dracula."
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Wisbourg, Germany based estate agent Knock dispatches his associate, Hutter, to Count Orlok's castle in Transylvania as the Count wants to purchase a isolated house in Wisbourg. They plan on selling him the one across the way from Hutter's own home. Hutter leaves his innocent wife, Ellen, with some friends while he is away. Hutter's trek is an unusual one, with many locals not wanting to take him near the castle where strange events have been occurring. Once at the castle, Hutter does manage to sell the Count the house, but he also notices and feels unusual occurrences, primarily feeling like there is a dark shadow hanging over him, even in the daytime when the Count is unusually asleep. Hutter eventually sees the Count's sleeping chamber in a crypt, and based on a book he has recently read, believes the Count is really a vampire or Nosferatu. While Hutter is trapped in the castle, the Count, hiding in a shipment of coffins, makes his way to Wisbourg, causing death along his way, ...

    Nosferatu (1922) First time watch one, This is the oldest movie that I have seen now, I have been putting this off a few times as I have never seen Silent movie in full before and I not to keen on Vamps movie. Yesterday I did try to watch this in early morning before work but I could not get into for some reason , I did turn it off about 20 minutes into the movie. When I got back from work, I gave it another go in full this time. For being first Vampire movie, it was really good and some very cool creepy moments in this movie. I loved those shadow scenes. The vampire it's self was really creepy for time and for a PG movie and I didn't mind the whole reading scenes but when they were writing, I could not make some of handwriting which did bother me also I didn't like how scene were moved very slowly, It kinda of annoying. I don't think it was intended but I found the chase near the very end very funny and the ending was okay-ish for time. 7 out of 10 it's was really good movie

    I just wouldn't be making my own stuff if it wasn't for this film and I doubt I am alone in that as it's influence is still strong all these years later. A stunning work of visual art, so glad it wasn't actually destroyed when they tried. The use of light and dark, casting shadows in particular is exceptional. Very much an excellent example of the Expressionist movement of it's day. The fact that this film is up for another release almost a century after it was made is testament to it's beauty, influence and artistry. Even with it's deviations from the plot it is still my favorite, if unofficial adaption of Dracula, and likely still my favorite vampire design with it's creepy rodent qualities adding to the unnerving feel of the entire piece.

    Even after almost nine decades, F. W. Murnau's film remains a classic of horror cinema. The film contains some genuinely shocking moments, especially when Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) comes to visit Graf Orlok (aka Nosferatu's) lair. Played by Max Schreck, Nosferatu is a genuinely creepy monster; with adept use of - at that time radical - cinematic techniques, director Murnau shows how he can reappear and disappear at will. No one appears to be able to resist him; his demise at the end of the film is mostly due to hubris - the belief that he is somehow indestructible. MOSFERATU also contains some memorable images: the rats moving in and around Nosferatu's coffin; the plague-ridden street, with coffins coming out of various doors; the lonely dog-cart moving slowly across a desolate landscape towards Nosferatu's castle. The version I saw had been recently restores (2010), with a new score and the original German title-cards (with English translations). Happily enough, the translations do not attempt to popularize the film by renaming Nosferatu Dracula.

    Nosferatu is one of the most influential horror movies ever made, and many movies own a lot to it, even it they don't know it. Even if Nosferatu isn't Original (More or less stolen from Dracula), it's still worth a watch and set the less popular image of a monster vampire instead of the other often handsome vampire (who own a lot to Stoker and Bela Lugosi). If you want a movie that still have the roots in German expressionism with out going nuts with it, this is the movie of it, there's scenes that keeps it pure, like shadows and certain camera angels, but unlike Doctor Caligari, I don't feel like it's go to the surreal. I don't think there's any need to summarize the plot since many people above me done it before. But i want to give huge credit to Max Schreck for the role of Orlok, he and Lugosi are the best actors when it comes to Dracula. I would also want to give credit to Alexander Granach, he made Renfield / Knock feel very alive, even 91 years later. If you watch this movie, turn down the lights, grab a drink, and just relax and let this creepy movie eat you, i would recommend watching many different editions of this movie, since the different musical scores give a different exercise.

    An unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula but the most influential among all the vampire films ever made, Nosferatu is an eerie, creepy, Gothic & haunting masterpiece that may not look frightening from today's standards but its chilling atmosphere can still rival the best of what modern film industry has to offer. A silent horror that benefits greatly from a brilliantly written screenplay that was then superbly executed on screen by its classy direction, brilliant use of expressionism from its cast, especially Max Schreck as vampire Count Orlok, innovative cinematography & editing, exceptionally haunting music as well as beautiful use of its uncanny locations. Almost a century has passed since this film first came out & it holding strong even today is a result of strong cult following, strength & visual appeal of this motion picture. On an overall scale, Nosferatu is one of the finest work of art & probably one of the most important events in cinema history that commenced the effective horror genre while also slightly altering the legacy of vampire myths.

    due to the lack of availability of this film it took me ten years to find it.. so after a long wait, I watched it and I liked it particularly the music, now watching the American cousin-- Dracula 1st I noticed that some of what was in 1931 Dracula was not in 1922 nosferatu. I don't know quite how to asses this. the 31 version seems more complete but yet in 1922 a lot of what was available 9 years later had an input,, yea I could follow the story,, it seemed like certain scenes parts were left out.. or was it that Dracula added scenes.. hard to tell,, this version I feel is darker than the American cousin. the music definitely better. I feel that if I watch this one again I will like it more and upgrade my 8 to a 10 i'm sure of that.. being from Germany I didn't realize FW Morneau talent'ts for the silent film,, he did a wonderful job with this I really did enjoy the movie,, kinda wish it was available before I watched Dracula.

    Iconic film character alert! Everyone knows this guy. In fact, after a night on the tiles, some of us have woken up looking like Nosferatu (and indeed walking like him too, if curry was involved). To be honest though, after seeing clips of this and all the parodies and homages and what not, I wasn't even sure if I had seen the film or not, but I've watched it now and am glad to say that even though it's roughly a couple of hundred years old, it's great! Johnathon Harker, estate agent, is sent by his boss Renfield to Transalvania, where he's to sell a house to Count Dracula (in the version I had anyway). He's only taken so far by the locals, who leave him outside the 'land of phantoms'. Not before long a creepy carriage picks him up and drops him outside of the castle, where the Count reads over a letter from Renfield, and then tries to drink his blood when Harker cuts his finger. Harker's a bit confused by this, and even more confused when he wakes up in the morning with a sore neck, but shrugs it off (the guy playing him is a bit goofy, at least for the first half of the film). Thanks to a handy 'Vampires for idiots' book that he's found, Harker discovers that the guy who sleeps all day, likes blood, and remarked about how Harker's wife had a lovely neck is actually a vampire! And he was hiding it so well! Worse still, Harker's now trapped in the castle and Dracula (or Nosferatu or Orlock) is bound for Bremen in boat full of soon to be dead sailors. Can Harker make it back in time? Apart from the phrase "German Expressionism" I know nothing about German Expressionism, but if that means loads of mood, shadows, Gothic atmosphere, long fingernails, swooning, images of coffins being carried through the streets, then I'm all for it. This film was a blast from start to finish, with nary a moment wasted. If I had a time machine I'd back to 1922 and say 'mad props' to Max Schreck, whatever that means.

    To see "Nosferatu" is to be frightened. Max Schreck, the actor who portrays the vampire, seems to be much more than a man in a scary costume: he seems to be a literal monster from another age of the Earth. The vampire's makeup and prosthetics place him at the nadir of "uncanny valley," a contemporary term referring to a humanoid figure that is so nearly-but-not-quite human that it prompts feelings of discomfort and revulsion in those who see it. When Schreck first appears on screen, standing in the shadows and staring straight into the camera, the horror genre set a bar that it may not have reached again in the subsequent 90 years.

    Clarification is required  when we talk about this film, we are talking about three different things: a discrete work of art, a cultural phenomenon and a viewing experience. Murnau's film, which was made in 1922 and in many ways shows it, is the beginning of vampire films. Working with less precedence than all the horror film directors who followed him, Murnau helped shape the horror genre with choices that he made in presenting this story. Many of these still work very well, including the spooky shadow-on-the-wall sequence and the horizontal-to-vertical rise of the vampire from his coffin. Your enjoyment of this film, however, will not be determined solely by what Murnau did. Instead, it will be influenced by a number of factors. From a personal point of view, it will have to do with how you feel about vampire films in general, with whether you've seen the Herzog/Kinski 1979 version of this film(which is absolutely wonderful), and with how your version of this classic is presented to you. In my case, for instance, I had to endure what was a truly horrible modern music soundtrack that Eureka Video felt entitled to inflict upon its customers, and clumsily translated intertitles as well. Were I to have seen this with better music (and it's hard to imagine that worse music could be found) and better translations of the original German caption-boards, I would have been spared some pain. However, these minor quibbles aside, the film is beautiful. The camera angles are innovative, the images are stunning, and although Gustav von Wangenheim as the Jonathan Harker wannabe Thomas Hutter is not a great actor, the rest of the cast, including Greta Schr&ouml;der as his wife, Alexander Granach as the Renfield clone named Knock and, of course, Max Schreck (his name in German actually means "fright" or "fear") as Count Orlok are all brilliant in their roles. As for exterior locations, the quaint Hanseatic towns of L&uuml;beck and Wismar give the film added authenticity and period charm. Is it scary? Well, not so much today, but it's not really the fault of this film that we have come to recognise every convention it uses. After all, most of them are original to this film and have themselves been copied in the subsequent iterations that we've seen. and in any case, even where it is not scary, it remains deeply eerie. Is this film good? Very definitely yes, although on a personal level, if you asked me about early atmospheric films regarding vampires, I would have to admit that I prefer Carl Theodor Dreyer's "Vampyr", filmed ten years later in 1932. Still, considering the advances made in the intervening decade, Murnau's earlier film is an incredible accomplishment. And Max Schreck, who would come back, thanks to Willem Dafoe, some seventy-eight years later to become an equally haunting if somewhat funnier character in E. Elias Merhige's "Shadow of the Vampire", creates a horror archetype here that we have been living  and dying  with ever since.

    Considering the date of this film, the film is actually really good, don't get my wrong there were points in the film I was thinking.. Is anything good going to happen. But this film still crepes me out. If I had to compare this to "Dracula" I think I actually prefer this version. Though it's a enjoyable film if you have patience. Story Line: New at the time, Interesting, 6/10 Cast/Acting 7/10 Due to it not being any speaking roles it's hard to tell if the cast was up for it or not but no over the top cast that I noticed. Scares 3/10 This film did't scare me, though at some parts the films seemed just weird rather than scary. Location: The locations used are really nice and beautiful 6 and a half/10

Well, not so much today, but it's not really the fault of this film that we have come to recognise every convention it uses. After all, most of them are original to this film and have themselves been copied in the subsequent iterations that we've seen. and in any case, even where it is not scary, it remains deeply eerie. Is this film good? Very definitely yes, although on a personal level, if you asked me about early atmospheric films regarding vampires, I would have to admit that I prefer Carl Theodor Dreyer's "Vampyr", filmed ten years later in 1932. Still, considering the advances made in the intervening decade, Murnau's earlier film is an incredible accomplishment. And Max Schreck, who would come back, thanks to Willem Dafoe, some seventy-eight years later to become an equally haunting if somewhat funnier character in E. Elias Merhige's "Shadow of the Vampire", creates a horror archetype here that we have been living  and dying  with ever since.

    Considering the date of this film, the film is actually really good, don't get my wrong there were points in the film I was thinking.. Is anything good going to happen. But this film still crepes me out. If I had to compare this to "Dracula" I think I actually prefer this version. Though it's a enjoyable film if you have patience. Story Line: New at the time, Interesting, 6/10 Cast/Acting 7/10 Due to it not being any speaking roles it's hard to tell if the cast was up for it or not but no over the top cast that I noticed. Scares 3/10 This film did't scare me, though at some parts the films seemed just weird rather than scary. Location: The locations used are really nice and beautiful 6 and a half/10

    Nosferatu (1922) First time watch one, This is the oldest movie that I have seen now, I have been putting this off a few times as I have never seen Silent movie in full before and I not to keen on Vamps movie. Yesterday I did try to watch this in early morning before work but I could not get into for some reason , I did turn it off about 20 minutes into the movie. When I got back from work, I gave it another go in full this time. For being first Vampire movie, it was really good and some very cool creepy moments in this movie. I loved those shadow scenes. The vampire it's self was really creepy for time and for a PG movie and I didn't mind the whole reading scenes but when they were writing, I could not make some of handwriting which did bother me also I didn't like how scene were moved very slowly, It kinda of annoying. I don't think it was intended but I found the chase near the very end very funny and the ending was okay-ish for time. 7 out of 10 it's was really good movie

    I just wouldn't be making my own stuff if it wasn't for this film and I doubt I am alone in that as it's influence is still strong all these years later. A stunning work of visual art, so glad it wasn't actually destroyed when they tried. The use of light and dark, casting shadows in particular is exceptional. Very much an excellent example of the Expressionist movement of it's day. The fact that this film is up for another release almost a century after it was made is testament to it's beauty, influence and artistry. Even with it's deviations from the plot it is still my favorite, if unofficial adaption of Dracula, and likely still my favorite vampire design with it's creepy rodent qualities adding to the unnerving feel of the entire piece.

    Even after almost nine decades, F. W. Murnau's film remains a classic of horror cinema. The film contains some genuinely shocking moments, especially when Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) comes to visit Graf Orlok (aka Nosferatu's) lair. Played by Max Schreck, Nosferatu is a genuinely creepy monster; with adept use of - at that time radical - cinematic techniques, director Murnau shows how he can reappear and disappear at will. No one appears to be able to resist him; his demise at the end of the film is mostly due to hubris - the belief that he is somehow indestructible. MOSFERATU also contains some memorable images: the rats moving in and around Nosferatu's coffin; the plague-ridden street, with coffins coming out of various doors; the lonely dog-cart moving slowly across a desolate landscape towards Nosferatu's castle. The version I saw had been recently restores (2010), with a new score and the original German title-cards (with English translations). Happily enough, the translations do not attempt to popularize the film by renaming Nosferatu Dracula.

    Nosferatu is one of the most influential horror movies ever made, and many movies own a lot to it, even it they don't know it. Even if Nosferatu isn't Original (More or less stolen from Dracula), it's still worth a watch and set the less popular image of a monster vampire instead of the other often handsome vampire (who own a lot to Stoker and Bela Lugosi). If you want a movie that still have the roots in German expressionism with out going nuts with it, this is the movie of it, there's scenes that keeps it pure, like shadows and certain camera angels, but unlike Doctor Caligari, I don't feel like it's go to the surreal. I don't think there's any need to summarize the plot since many people above me done it before. But i want to give huge credit to Max Schreck for the role of Orlok, he and Lugosi are the best actors when it comes to Dracula. I would also want to give credit to Alexander Granach, he made Renfield / Knock feel very alive, even 91 years later. If you watch this movie, turn down the lights, grab a drink, and just relax and let this creepy movie eat you, i would recommend watching many different editions of this movie, since the different musical scores give a different exercise.

    An unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula but the most influential among all the vampire films ever made, Nosferatu is an eerie, creepy, Gothic & haunting masterpiece that may not look frightening from today's standards but its chilling atmosphere can still rival the best of what modern film industry has to offer. A silent horror that benefits greatly from a brilliantly written screenplay that was then superbly executed on screen by its classy direction, brilliant use of expressionism from its cast, especially Max Schreck as vampire Count Orlok, innovative cinematography & editing, exceptionally haunting music as well as beautiful use of its uncanny locations. Almost a century has passed since this film first came out & it holding strong even today is a result of strong cult following, strength & visual appeal of this motion picture. On an overall scale, Nosferatu is one of the finest work of art & probably one of the most important events in cinema history that commenced the effective horror genre while also slightly altering the legacy of vampire myths.

    due to the lack of availability of this film it took me ten years to find it.. so after a long wait, I watched it and I liked it particularly the music, now watching the American cousin-- Dracula 1st I noticed that some of what was in 1931 Dracula was not in 1922 nosferatu. I don't know quite how to asses this. the 31 version seems more complete but yet in 1922 a lot of what was available 9 years later had an input,, yea I could follow the story,, it seemed like certain scenes parts were left out.. or was it that Dracula added scenes.. hard to tell,, this version I feel is darker than the American cousin. the music definitely better. I feel that if I watch this one again I will like it more and upgrade my 8 to a 10 i'm sure of that.. being from Germany I didn't realize FW Morneau talent'ts for the silent film,, he did a wonderful job with this I really did enjoy the movie,, kinda wish it was available before I watched Dracula.

    Iconic film character alert! Everyone knows this guy. In fact, after a night on the tiles, some of us have woken up looking like Nosferatu (and indeed walking like him too, if curry was involved). To be honest though, after seeing clips of this and all the parodies and homages and what not, I wasn't even sure if I had seen the film or not, but I've watched it now and am glad to say that even though it's roughly a couple of hundred years old, it's great! Johnathon Harker, estate agent, is sent by his boss Renfield to Transalvania, where he's to sell a house to Count Dracula (in the version I had anyway). He's only taken so far by the locals, who leave him outside the 'land of phantoms'. Not before long a creepy carriage picks him up and drops him outside of the castle, where the Count reads over a letter from Renfield, and then tries to drink his blood when Harker cuts his finger. Harker's a bit confused by this, and even more confused when he wakes up in the morning with a sore neck, but shrugs it off (the guy playing him is a bit goofy, at least for the first half of the film). Thanks to a handy 'Vampires for idiots' book that he's found, Harker discovers that the guy who sleeps all day, likes blood, and remarked about how Harker's wife had a lovely neck is actually a vampire! And he was hiding it so well! Worse still, Harker's now trapped in the castle and Dracula (or Nosferatu or Orlock) is bound for Bremen in boat full of soon to be dead sailors. Can Harker make it back in time? Apart from the phrase "German Expressionism" I know nothing about German Expressionism, but if that means loads of mood, shadows, Gothic atmosphere, long fingernails, swooning, images of coffins being carried through the streets, then I'm all for it. This film was a blast from start to finish, with nary a moment wasted. If I had a time machine I'd back to 1922 and say 'mad props' to Max Schreck, whatever that means.

    To see "Nosferatu" is to be frightened. Max Schreck, the actor who portrays the vampire, seems to be much more than a man in a scary costume: he seems to be a literal monster from another age of the Earth. The vampire's makeup and prosthetics place him at the nadir of "uncanny valley," a contemporary term referring to a humanoid figure that is so nearly-but-not-quite human that it prompts feelings of discomfort and revulsion in those who see it. When Schreck first appears on screen, standing in the shadows and staring straight into the camera, the horror genre set a bar that it may not have reached again in the subsequent 90 years.

    Clarification is required  when we talk about this film, we are talking about three different things: a discrete work of art, a cultural phenomenon and a viewing experience. Murnau's film, which was made in 1922 and in many ways shows it, is the beginning of vampire films. Working with less precedence than all the horror film directors who followed him, Murnau helped shape the horror genre with choices that he made in presenting this story. Many of these still work very well, including the spooky shadow-on-the-wall sequence and the horizontal-to-vertical rise of the vampire from his coffin. Your enjoyment of this film, however, will not be determined solely by what Murnau did. Instead, it will be influenced by a number of factors. From a personal point of view, it will have to do with how you feel about vampire films in general, with whether you've seen the Herzog/Kinski 1979 version of this film(which is absolutely wonderful), and with how your version of this classic is presented to you. In my case, for instance, I had to endure what was a truly horrible modern music soundtrack that Eureka Video felt entitled to inflict upon its customers, and clumsily translated intertitles as well. Were I to have seen this with better music (and it's hard to imagine that worse music could be found) and better translations of the original German caption-boards, I would have been spared some pain. However, these minor quibbles aside, the film is beautiful. The camera angles are innovative, the images are stunning, and although Gustav von Wangenheim as the Jonathan Harker wannabe Thomas Hutter is not a great actor, the rest of the cast, including Greta Schr&ouml;der as his wife, Alexander Granach as the Renfield clone named Knock and, of course, Max Schreck (his name in German actually means "fright" or "fear") as Count Orlok are all brilliant in their roles.

Well, not so much today, but it's not really the fault of this film that we have come to recognise every convention it uses. After all, most of them are original to this film and have themselves been copied in the subsequent iterations that we've seen. and in any case, even where it is not scary, it remains deeply eerie. Is this film good? Very definitely yes, although on a personal level, if you asked me about early atmospheric films regarding vampires, I would have to admit that I prefer Carl Theodor Dreyer's "Vampyr", filmed ten years later in 1932. Still, considering the advances made in the intervening decade, Murnau's earlier film is an incredible accomplishment. And Max Schreck, who would come back, thanks to Willem Dafoe, some seventy-eight years later to become an equally haunting if somewhat funnier character in E. Elias Merhige's "Shadow of the Vampire", creates a horror archetype here that we have been living  and dying  with ever since.

    Considering the date of this film, the film is actually really good, don't get my wrong there were points in the film I was thinking.. Is anything good going to happen. But this film still crepes me out. If I had to compare this to "Dracula" I think I actually prefer this version. Though it's a enjoyable film if you have patience. Story Line: New at the time, Interesting, 6/10 Cast/Acting 7/10 Due to it not being any speaking roles it's hard to tell if the cast was up for it or not but no over the top cast that I noticed. Scares 3/10 This film did't scare me, though at some parts the films seemed just weird rather than scary. Location: The locations used are really nice and beautiful 6 and a half/10

    Nosferatu (1922) First time watch one, This is the oldest movie that I have seen now, I have been putting this off a few times as I have never seen Silent movie in full before and I not to keen on Vamps movie. Yesterday I did try to watch this in early morning before work but I could not get into for some reason , I did turn it off about 20 minutes into the movie. When I got back from work, I gave it another go in full this time. For being first Vampire movie, it was really good and some very cool creepy moments in this movie. I loved those shadow scenes. The vampire it's self was really creepy for time and for a PG movie and I didn't mind the whole reading scenes but when they were writing, I could not make some of handwriting which did bother me also I didn't like how scene were moved very slowly, It kinda of annoying. I don't think it was intended but I found the chase near the very end very funny and the ending was okay-ish for time. 7 out of 10 it's was really good movie

    I just wouldn't be making my own stuff if it wasn't for this film and I doubt I am alone in that as it's influence is still strong all these years later. A stunning work of visual art, so glad it wasn't actually destroyed when they tried. The use of light and dark, casting shadows in particular is exceptional. Very much an excellent example of the Expressionist movement of it's day. The fact that this film is up for another release almost a century after it was made is testament to it's beauty, influence and artistry. Even with it's deviations from the plot it is still my favorite, if unofficial adaption of Dracula, and likely still my favorite vampire design with it's creepy rodent qualities adding to the unnerving feel of the entire piece.

    Even after almost nine decades, F. W. Murnau's film remains a classic of horror cinema. The film contains some genuinely shocking moments, especially when Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) comes to visit Graf Orlok (aka Nosferatu's) lair. Played by Max Schreck, Nosferatu is a genuinely creepy monster; with adept use of - at that time radical - cinematic techniques, director Murnau shows how he can reappear and disappear at will. No one appears to be able to resist him; his demise at the end of the film is mostly due to hubris - the belief that he is somehow indestructible. MOSFERATU also contains some memorable images: the rats moving in and around Nosferatu's coffin; the plague-ridden street, with coffins coming out of various doors; the lonely dog-cart moving slowly across a desolate landscape towards Nosferatu's castle. The version I saw had been recently restores (2010), with a new score and the original German title-cards (with English translations). Happily enough, the translations do not attempt to popularize the film by renaming Nosferatu Dracula.

    Nosferatu is one of the most influential horror movies ever made, and many movies own a lot to it, even it they don't know it. Even if Nosferatu isn't Original (More or less stolen from Dracula), it's still worth a watch and set the less popular image of a monster vampire instead of the other often handsome vampire (who own a lot to Stoker and Bela Lugosi). If you want a movie that still have the roots in German expressionism with out going nuts with it, this is the movie of it, there's scenes that keeps it pure, like shadows and certain camera angels, but unlike Doctor Caligari, I don't feel like it's go to the surreal. I don't think there's any need to summarize the plot since many people above me done it before. But i want to give huge credit to Max Schreck for the role of Orlok, he and Lugosi are the best actors when it comes to Dracula. I would also want to give credit to Alexander Granach, he made Renfield / Knock feel very alive, even 91 years later. If you watch this movie, turn down the lights, grab a drink, and just relax and let this creepy movie eat you, i would recommend watching many different editions of this movie, since the different musical scores give a different exercise.

    An unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula but the most influential among all the vampire films ever made, Nosferatu is an eerie, creepy, Gothic & haunting masterpiece that may not look frightening from today's standards but its chilling atmosphere can still rival the best of what modern film industry has to offer. A silent horror that benefits greatly from a brilliantly written screenplay that was then superbly executed on screen by its classy direction, brilliant use of expressionism from its cast, especially Max Schreck as vampire Count Orlok, innovative cinematography & editing, exceptionally haunting music as well as beautiful use of its uncanny locations. Almost a century has passed since this film first came out & it holding strong even today is a result of strong cult following, strength & visual appeal of this motion picture. On an overall scale, Nosferatu is one of the finest work of art & probably one of the most important events in cinema history that commenced the effective horror genre while also slightly altering the legacy of vampire myths.

    due to the lack of availability of this film it took me ten years to find it.. so after a long wait, I watched it and I liked it particularly the music, now watching the American cousin-- Dracula 1st I noticed that some of what was in 1931 Dracula was not in 1922 nosferatu. I don't know quite how to asses this. the 31 version seems more complete but yet in 1922 a lot of what was available 9 years later had an input,, yea I could follow the story,, it seemed like certain scenes parts were left out.. or was it that Dracula added scenes.. hard to tell,, this version I feel is darker than the American cousin. the music definitely better. I feel that if I watch this one again I will like it more and upgrade my 8 to a 10 i'm sure of that.. being from Germany I didn't realize FW Morneau talent'ts for the silent film,, he did a wonderful job with this I really did enjoy the movie,, kinda wish it was available before I watched Dracula.

    Iconic film character alert! Everyone knows this guy. In fact, after a night on the tiles, some of us have woken up looking like Nosferatu (and indeed walking like him too, if curry was involved). To be honest though, after seeing clips of this and all the parodies and homages and what not, I wasn't even sure if I had seen the film or not, but I've watched it now and am glad to say that even though it's roughly a couple of hundred years old, it's great! Johnathon Harker, estate agent, is sent by his boss Renfield to Transalvania, where he's to sell a house to Count Dracula (in the version I had anyway). He's only taken so far by the locals, who leave him outside the 'land of phantoms'. Not before long a creepy carriage picks him up and drops him outside of the castle, where the Count reads over a letter from Renfield, and then tries to drink his blood when Harker cuts his finger. Harker's a bit confused by this, and even more confused when he wakes up in the morning with a sore neck, but shrugs it off (the guy playing him is a bit goofy, at least for the first half of the film). Thanks to a handy 'Vampires for idiots' book that he's found, Harker discovers that the guy who sleeps all day, likes blood, and remarked about how Harker's wife had a lovely neck is actually a vampire! And he was hiding it so well! Worse still, Harker's now trapped in the castle and Dracula (or Nosferatu or Orlock) is bound for Bremen in boat full of soon to be dead sailors. Can Harker make it back in time? Apart from the phrase "German Expressionism" I know nothing about German Expressionism, but if that means loads of mood, shadows, Gothic atmosphere, long fingernails, swooning, images of coffins being carried through the streets, then I'm all for it. This film was a blast from start to finish, with nary a moment wasted. If I had a time machine I'd back to 1922 and say 'mad props' to Max Schreck, whatever that means.

    To see "Nosferatu" is to be frightened. Max Schreck, the actor who portrays the vampire, seems to be much more than a man in a scary costume: he seems to be a literal monster from another age of the Earth. The vampire's makeup and prosthetics place him at the nadir of "uncanny valley," a contemporary term referring to a humanoid figure that is so nearly-but-not-quite human that it prompts feelings of discomfort and revulsion in those who see it. When Schreck first appears on screen, standing in the shadows and staring straight into the camera, the horror genre set a bar that it may not have reached again in the subsequent 90 years.

    Clarification is required  when we talk about this film, we are talking about three different things: a discrete work of art, a cultural phenomenon and a viewing experience. Murnau's film, which was made in 1922 and in many ways shows it, is the beginning of vampire films. Working with less precedence than all the horror film directors who followed him, Murnau helped shape the horror genre with choices that he made in presenting this story. Many of these still work very well, including the spooky shadow-on-the-wall sequence and the horizontal-to-vertical rise of the vampire from his coffin. Your enjoyment of this film, however, will not be determined solely by what Murnau did. Instead, it will be influenced by a number of factors. From a personal point of view, it will have to do with how you feel about vampire films in general, with whether you've seen the Herzog/Kinski 1979 version of this film(which is absolutely wonderful), and with how your version of this classic is presented to you. In my case, for instance, I had to endure what was a truly horrible modern music soundtrack that Eureka Video felt entitled to inflict upon its customers, and clumsily translated intertitles as well. Were I to have seen this with better music (and it's hard to imagine that worse music could be found) and better translations of the original German caption-boards, I would have been spared some pain. However, these minor quibbles aside, the film is beautiful. The camera angles are innovative, the images are stunning, and although Gustav von Wangenheim as the Jonathan Harker wannabe Thomas Hutter is not a great actor, the rest of the cast, including Greta Schr&ouml;der as his wife, Alexander Granach as the Renfield clone named Knock and, of course, Max Schreck (his name in German actually means "fright" or "fear") as Count Orlok are all brilliant in their roles.

Well, not so much today, but it's not really the fault of this film that we have come to recognise every convention it uses. After all, most of them are original to this film and have themselves been copied in the subsequent iterations that we've seen. and in any case, even where it is not scary, it remains deeply eerie. Is this film good? Very definitely yes, although on a personal level, if you asked me about early atmospheric films regarding vampires, I would have to admit that I prefer Carl Theodor Dreyer's "Vampyr", filmed ten years later in 1932. Still, considering the advances made in the intervening decade, Murnau's earlier film is an incredible accomplishment. And Max Schreck, who would come back, thanks to Willem Dafoe, some seventy-eight years later to become an equally haunting if somewhat funnier character in E. Elias Merhige's "Shadow of the Vampire", creates a horror archetype here that we have been living  and dying  with ever since.

    Considering the date of this film, the film is actually really good, don't get my wrong there were points in the film I was thinking.. Is anything good going to happen. But this film still crepes me out. If I had to compare this to "Dracula" I think I actually prefer this version. Though it's a enjoyable film if you have patience. Story Line: New at the time, Interesting, 6/10 Cast/Acting 7/10 Due to it not being any speaking roles it's hard to tell if the cast was up for it or not but no over the top cast that I noticed. Scares 3/10 This film did't scare me, though at some parts the films seemed just weird rather than scary. Location: The locations used are really nice and beautiful 6 and a half/10

    Nosferatu (1922) First time watch one, This is the oldest movie that I have seen now, I have been putting this off a few times as I have never seen Silent movie in full before and I not to keen on Vamps movie. Yesterday I did try to watch this in early morning before work but I could not get into for some reason , I did turn it off about 20 minutes into the movie. When I got back from work, I gave it another go in full this time. For being first Vampire movie, it was really good and some very cool creepy moments in this movie. I loved those shadow scenes. The vampire it's self was really creepy for time and for a PG movie and I didn't mind the whole reading scenes but when they were writing, I could not make some of handwriting which did bother me also I didn't like how scene were moved very slowly, It kinda of annoying. I don't think it was intended but I found the chase near the very end very funny and the ending was okay-ish for time. 7 out of 10 it's was really good movie

    I just wouldn't be making my own stuff if it wasn't for this film and I doubt I am alone in that as it's influence is still strong all these years later. A stunning work of visual art, so glad it wasn't actually destroyed when they tried. The use of light and dark, casting shadows in particular is exceptional. Very much an excellent example of the Expressionist movement of it's day. The fact that this film is up for another release almost a century after it was made is testament to it's beauty, influence and artistry. Even with it's deviations from the plot it is still my favorite, if unofficial adaption of Dracula, and likely still my favorite vampire design with it's creepy rodent qualities adding to the unnerving feel of the entire piece.

    Even after almost nine decades, F. W. Murnau's film remains a classic of horror cinema. The film contains some genuinely shocking moments, especially when Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) comes to visit Graf Orlok (aka Nosferatu's) lair. Played by Max Schreck, Nosferatu is a genuinely creepy monster; with adept use of - at that time radical - cinematic techniques, director Murnau shows how he can reappear and disappear at will. No one appears to be able to resist him; his demise at the end of the film is mostly due to hubris - the belief that he is somehow indestructible. MOSFERATU also contains some memorable images: the rats moving in and around Nosferatu's coffin; the plague-ridden street, with coffins coming out of various doors; the lonely dog-cart moving slowly across a desolate landscape towards Nosferatu's castle. The version I saw had been recently restores (2010), with a new score and the original German title-cards (with English translations). Happily enough, the translations do not attempt to popularize the film by renaming Nosferatu Dracula.

    Nosferatu is one of the most influential horror movies ever made, and many movies own a lot to it, even it they don't know it. Even if Nosferatu isn't Original (More or less stolen from Dracula), it's still worth a watch and set the less popular image of a monster vampire instead of the other often handsome vampire (who own a lot to Stoker and Bela Lugosi). If you want a movie that still have the roots in German expressionism with out going nuts with it, this is the movie of it, there's scenes that keeps it pure, like shadows and certain camera angels, but unlike Doctor Caligari, I don't feel like it's go to the surreal. I don't think there's any need to summarize the plot since many people above me done it before. But i want to give huge credit to Max Schreck for the role of Orlok, he and Lugosi are the best actors when it comes to Dracula. I would also want to give credit to Alexander Granach, he made Renfield / Knock feel very alive, even 91 years later. If you watch this movie, turn down the lights, grab a drink, and just relax and let this creepy movie eat you, i would recommend watching many different editions of this movie, since the different musical scores give a different exercise.

    An unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula but the most influential among all the vampire films ever made, Nosferatu is an eerie, creepy, Gothic & haunting masterpiece that may not look frightening from today's standards but its chilling atmosphere can still rival the best of what modern film industry has to offer. A silent horror that benefits greatly from a brilliantly written screenplay that was then superbly executed on screen by its classy direction, brilliant use of expressionism from its cast, especially Max Schreck as vampire Count Orlok, innovative cinematography & editing, exceptionally haunting music as well as beautiful use of its uncanny locations. Almost a century has passed since this film first came out & it holding strong even today is a result of strong cult following, strength & visual appeal of this motion picture. On an overall scale, Nosferatu is one of the finest work of art & probably one of the most important events in cinema history that commenced the effective horror genre while also slightly altering the legacy of vampire myths.

    due to the lack of availability of this film it took me ten years to find it.. so after a long wait, I watched it and I liked it particularly the music, now watching the American cousin-- Dracula 1st I noticed that some of what was in 1931 Dracula was not in 1922 nosferatu. I don't know quite how to asses this. the 31 version seems more complete but yet in 1922 a lot of what was available 9 years later had an input,, yea I could follow the story,, it seemed like certain scenes parts were left out.. or was it that Dracula added scenes.. hard to tell,, this version I feel is darker than the American cousin. the music definitely better. I feel that if I watch this one again I will like it more and upgrade my 8 to a 10 i'm sure of that.. being from Germany I didn't realize FW Morneau talent'ts for the silent film,, he did a wonderful job with this I really did enjoy the movie,, kinda wish it was available before I watched Dracula.

    Iconic film character alert! Everyone knows this guy. In fact, after a night on the tiles, some of us have woken up looking like Nosferatu (and indeed walking like him too, if curry was involved). To be honest though, after seeing clips of this and all the parodies and homages and what not, I wasn't even sure if I had seen the film or not, but I've watched it now and am glad to say that even though it's roughly a couple of hundred years old, it's great! Johnathon Harker, estate agent, is sent by his boss Renfield to Transalvania, where he's to sell a house to Count Dracula (in the version I had anyway). He's only taken so far by the locals, who leave him outside the 'land of phantoms'. Not before long a creepy carriage picks him up and drops him outside of the castle, where the Count reads over a letter from Renfield, and then tries to drink his blood when Harker cuts his finger. Harker's a bit confused by this, and even more confused when he wakes up in the morning with a sore neck, but shrugs it off (the guy playing him is a bit goofy, at least for the first half of the film). Thanks to a handy 'Vampires for idiots' book that he's found, Harker discovers that the guy who sleeps all day, likes blood, and remarked about how Harker's wife had a lovely neck is actually a vampire! And he was hiding it so well! Worse still, Harker's now trapped in the castle and Dracula (or Nosferatu or Orlock) is bound for Bremen in boat full of soon to be dead sailors. Can Harker make it back in time? Apart from the phrase "German Expressionism" I know nothing about German Expressionism, but if that means loads of mood, shadows, Gothic atmosphere, long fingernails, swooning, images of coffins being carried through the streets, then I'm all for it. This film was a blast from start to finish, with nary a moment wasted. If I had a time machine I'd back to 1922 and say 'mad props' to Max Schreck, whatever that means.

    To see "Nosferatu" is to be frightened. Max Schreck, the actor who portrays the vampire, seems to be much more than a man in a scary costume: he seems to be a literal monster from another age of the Earth. The vampire's makeup and prosthetics place him at the nadir of "uncanny valley," a contemporary term referring to a humanoid figure that is so nearly-but-not-quite human that it prompts feelings of discomfort and revulsion in those who see it. When Schreck first appears on screen, standing in the shadows and staring straight into the camera, the horror genre set a bar that it may not have reached again in the subsequent 90 years.

    Clarification is required  when we talk about this film, we are talking about three different things: a discrete work of art, a cultural phenomenon and a viewing experience. Murnau's film, which was made in 1922 and in many ways shows it, is the beginning of vampire films. Working with less precedence than all the horror film directors who followed him, Murnau helped shape the horror genre with choices that he made in presenting this story. Many of these still work very well, including the spooky shadow-on-the-wall sequence and the horizontal-to-vertical rise of the vampire from his coffin. Your enjoyment of this film, however, will not be determined solely by what Murnau did. Instead, it will be influenced by a number of factors. From a personal point of view, it will have to do with how you feel about vampire films in general, with whether you've seen the Herzog/Kinski 1979 version of this film(which is absolutely wonderful), and with how your version of this classic is presented to you. In my case, for instance, I had to endure what was a truly horrible modern music soundtrack that Eureka Video felt entitled to inflict upon its customers, and clumsily translated intertitles as well. Were I to have seen this with better music (and it's hard to imagine that worse music could be found) and better translations of the original German caption-boards, I would have been spared some pain. However, these minor quibbles aside, the film is beautiful. The camera angles are innovative, the images are stunning, and although Gustav von Wangenheim as the Jonathan Harker wannabe Thomas Hutter is not a great actor, the rest of the cast, including Greta Schr&ouml;der as his wife, Alexander Granach as the Renfield clone named Knock and, of course, Max Schreck (his name in German actually means "fright" or "fear") as Count Orlok are all brilliant in their roles.

Well, not so much today, but it's not really the fault of this film that we have come to recognise every convention it uses. After all, most of them are original to this film and have themselves been copied in the subsequent iterations that we've seen. and in any case, even where it is not scary, it remains deeply eerie. Is this film good? Very definitely yes, although on a personal level, if you asked me about early atmospheric films regarding vampires, I would have to admit that I prefer Carl Theodor Dreyer's "Vampyr", filmed ten years later in 1932. Still, considering the advances made in the intervening decade, Murnau's earlier film is an incredible accomplishment. And Max Schreck, who would come back, thanks to Willem Dafoe, some seventy-eight years later to become an equally haunting if somewhat funnier character in E. Elias Merhige's "Shadow of the Vampire", creates a horror archetype here that we have been living  and dying  with ever since.

    Considering the date of this film, the film is actually really good, don't get my wrong there were points in the film I was thinking.. Is anything good going to happen. But this film still crepes me out. If I had to compare this to "Dracula" I think I actually prefer this version. Though it's a enjoyable film if you have patience. Story Line: New at the time, Interesting, 6/10 Cast/Acting 7/10 Due to it not being any speaking roles it's hard to tell if the cast was up for it or not but no over the top cast that I noticed. Scares 3/10 This film did't scare me, though at some parts the films seemed just weird rather than scary. Location: The locations used are really nice and beautiful 6 and a half/10

    Nosferatu (1922) First time watch one, This is the oldest movie that I have seen now, I have been putting this off a few times as I have never seen Silent movie in full before and I not to keen on Vamps movie. Yesterday I did try to watch this in early morning before work but I could not get into for some reason , I did turn it off about 20 minutes into the movie. When I got back from work, I gave it another go in full this time. For being first Vampire movie, it was really good and some very cool creepy moments in this movie. I loved those shadow scenes. The vampire it's self was really creepy for time and for a PG movie and I didn't mind the whole reading scenes but when they were writing, I could not make some of handwriting which did bother me also I didn't like how scene were moved very slowly, It kinda of annoying. I don't think it was intended but I found the chase near the very end very funny and the ending was okay-ish for time. 7 out of 10 it's was really good movie

    I just wouldn't be making my own stuff if it wasn't for this film and I doubt I am alone in that as it's influence is still strong all these years later. A stunning work of visual art, so glad it wasn't actually destroyed when they tried. The use of light and dark, casting shadows in particular is exceptional. Very much an excellent example of the Expressionist movement of it's day. The fact that this film is up for another release almost a century after it was made is testament to it's beauty, influence and artistry. Even with it's deviations from the plot it is still my favorite, if unofficial adaption of Dracula, and likely still my favorite vampire design with it's creepy rodent qualities adding to the unnerving feel of the entire piece.

    Even after almost nine decades, F. W. Murnau's film remains a classic of horror cinema. The film contains some genuinely shocking moments, especially when Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) comes to visit Graf Orlok (aka Nosferatu's) lair. Played by Max Schreck, Nosferatu is a genuinely creepy monster; with adept use of - at that time radical - cinematic techniques, director Murnau shows how he can reappear and disappear at will. No one appears to be able to resist him; his demise at the end of the film is mostly due to hubris - the belief that he is somehow indestructible. MOSFERATU also contains some memorable images: the rats moving in and around Nosferatu's coffin; the plague-ridden street, with coffins coming out of various doors; the lonely dog-cart moving slowly across a desolate landscape towards Nosferatu's castle. The version I saw had been recently restores (2010), with a new score and the original German title-cards (with English translations). Happily enough, the translations do not attempt to popularize the film by renaming Nosferatu Dracula.

    Nosferatu is one of the most influential horror movies ever made, and many movies own a lot to it, even it they don't know it. Even if Nosferatu isn't Original (More or less stolen from Dracula), it's still worth a watch and set the less popular image of a monster vampire instead of the other often handsome vampire (who own a lot to Stoker and Bela Lugosi). If you want a movie that still have the roots in German expressionism with out going nuts with it, this is the movie of it, there's scenes that keeps it pure, like shadows and certain camera angels, but unlike Doctor Caligari, I don't feel like it's go to the surreal. I don't think there's any need to summarize the plot since many people above me done it before. But i want to give huge credit to Max Schreck for the role of Orlok, he and Lugosi are the best actors when it comes to Dracula. I would also want to give credit to Alexander Granach, he made Renfield / Knock feel very alive, even 91 years later. If you watch this movie, turn down the lights, grab a drink, and just relax and let this creepy movie eat you, i would recommend watching many different editions of this movie, since the different musical scores give a different exercise.

    An unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula but the most influential among all the vampire films ever made, Nosferatu is an eerie, creepy, Gothic & haunting masterpiece that may not look frightening from today's standards but its chilling atmosphere can still rival the best of what modern film industry has to offer. A silent horror that benefits greatly from a brilliantly written screenplay that was then superbly executed on screen by its classy direction, brilliant use of expressionism from its cast, especially Max Schreck as vampire Count Orlok, innovative cinematography & editing, exceptionally haunting music as well as beautiful use of its uncanny locations. Almost a century has passed since this film first came out & it holding strong even today is a result of strong cult following, strength & visual appeal of this motion picture. On an overall scale, Nosferatu is one of the finest work of art & probably one of the most important events in cinema history that commenced the effective horror genre while also slightly altering the legacy of vampire myths.

    due to the lack of availability of this film it took me ten years to find it.. so after a long wait, I watched it and I liked it particularly the music, now watching the American cousin-- Dracula 1st I noticed that some of what was in 1931 Dracula was not in 1922 nosferatu. I don't know quite how to asses this. the 31 version seems more complete but yet in 1922 a lot of what was available 9 years later had an input,, yea I could follow the story,, it seemed like certain scenes parts were left out.. or was it that Dracula added scenes.. hard to tell,, this version I feel is darker than the American cousin. the music definitely better. I feel that if I watch this one again I will like it more and upgrade my 8 to a 10 i'm sure of that.. being from Germany I didn't realize FW Morneau talent'ts for the silent film,, he did a wonderful job with this I really did enjoy the movie,, kinda wish it was available before I watched Dracula.

    Iconic film character alert! Everyone knows this guy. In fact, after a night on the tiles, some of us have woken up looking like Nosferatu (and indeed walking like him too, if curry was involved). To be honest though, after seeing clips of this and all the parodies and homages and what not, I wasn't even sure if I had seen the film or not, but I've watched it now and am glad to say that even though it's roughly a couple of hundred years old, it's great! Johnathon Harker, estate agent, is sent by his boss Renfield to Transalvania, where he's to sell a house to Count Dracula (in the version I had anyway). He's only taken so far by the locals, who leave him outside the 'land of phantoms'. Not before long a creepy carriage picks him up and drops him outside of the castle, where the Count reads over a letter from Renfield, and then tries to drink his blood when Harker cuts his finger. Harker's a bit confused by this, and even more confused when he wakes up in the morning with a sore neck, but shrugs it off (the guy playing him is a bit goofy, at least for the first half of the film). Thanks to a handy 'Vampires for idiots' book that he's found, Harker discovers that the guy who sleeps all day, likes blood, and remarked about how Harker's wife had a lovely neck is actually a vampire! And he was hiding it so well! Worse still, Harker's now trapped in the castle and Dracula (or Nosferatu or Orlock) is bound for Bremen in boat full of soon to be dead sailors. Can Harker make it back in time? Apart from the phrase "German Expressionism" I know nothing about German Expressionism, but if that means loads of mood, shadows, Gothic atmosphere, long fingernails, swooning, images of coffins being carried through the streets, then I'm all for it. This film was a blast from start to finish, with nary a moment wasted. If I had a time machine I'd back to 1922 and say 'mad props' to Max Schreck, whatever that means.

    To see "Nosferatu" is to be frightened. Max Schreck, the actor who portrays the vampire, seems to be much more than a man in a scary costume: he seems to be a literal monster from another age of the Earth. The vampire's makeup and prosthetics place him at the nadir of "uncanny valley," a contemporary term referring to a humanoid figure that is so nearly-but-not-quite human that it prompts feelings of discomfort and revulsion in those who see it. When Schreck first appears on screen, standing in the shadows and staring straight into the camera, the horror genre set a bar that it may not have reached again in the subsequent 90 years.

    Clarification is required  when we talk about this film, we are talking about three different things: a discrete work of art, a cultural phenomenon and a viewing experience. Murnau's film, which was made in 1922 and in many ways shows it, is the beginning of vampire films. Working with less precedence than all the horror film directors who followed him, Murnau helped shape the horror genre with choices that he made in presenting this story. Many of these still work very well, including the spooky shadow-on-the-wall sequence and the horizontal-to-vertical rise of the vampire from his coffin. Your enjoyment of this film, however, will not be determined solely by what Murnau did. Instead, it will be influenced by a number of factors. From a personal point of view, it will have to do with how you feel about vampire films in general, with whether you've seen the Herzog/Kinski 1979 version of this film(which is absolutely wonderful), and with how your version of this classic is presented to you. In my case, for instance, I had to endure what was a truly horrible modern music soundtrack that Eureka Video felt entitled to inflict upon its customers, and clumsily translated intertitles as well. Were I to have seen this with better music (and it's hard to imagine that worse music could be found) and better translations of the original German caption-boards, I would have been spared some pain. However, these minor quibbles aside, the film is beautiful. The camera angles are innovative, the images are stunning, and although Gustav von Wangenheim as the Jonathan Harker wannabe Thomas Hutter is not a great actor, the rest of the cast, including Greta Schr&ouml;der as his wife, Alexander Granach as the Renfield clone named Knock and, of course, Max Schreck (his name in German actually means "fright" or "fear") as Count Orlok are all brilliant in their roles.

Well, not so much today, but it's not really the fault of this film that we have come to recognise every convention it uses. After all, most of them are original to this film and have themselves been copied in the subsequent iterations that we've seen. and in any case, even where it is not scary, it remains deeply eerie. Is this film good? Very definitely yes, although on a personal level, if you asked me about early atmospheric films regarding vampires, I would have to admit that I prefer Carl Theodor Dreyer's "Vampyr", filmed ten years later in 1932. Still, considering the advances made in the intervening decade, Murnau's earlier film is an incredible accomplishment. And Max Schreck, who would come back, thanks to Willem Dafoe, some seventy-eight years later to become an equally haunting if somewhat funnier character in E. Elias Merhige's "Shadow of the Vampire", creates a horror archetype here that we have been living  and dying  with ever since.

    Considering the date of this film, the film is actually really good, don't get my wrong there were points in the film I was thinking.. Is anything good going to happen. But this film still crepes me out. If I had to compare this to "Dracula" I think I actually prefer this version. Though it's a enjoyable film if you have patience. Story Line: New at the time, Interesting, 6/10 Cast/Acting 7/10 Due to it not being any speaking roles it's hard to tell if the cast was up for it or not but no over the top cast that I noticed. Scares 3/10 This film did't scare me, though at some parts the films seemed just weird rather than scary. Location: The locations used are really nice and beautiful 6 and a half/10
