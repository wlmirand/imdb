 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  San Francisco police officer Frank Connor is in a frantic search for a compatible bone marrow donor for his gravely ill son. There's only one catch: the potential donor is convicted multiple murderer Peter McCabe who sees a trip to the hospital as the perfect opportunity to get what he wants most: freedom. With McCabe's escape, the entire hospital becomes a battleground and Connor must pursue and, ironically, protect the deadly fugitive who is his son's only hope for survival.

    Desperate Measures This thriller is a fast and intense paced movie, which is often overlooked Andy Garcia does a great job playing desperate dad, trying to save he's leukemia ridden son. And Michal Keaton does an even better job playing manipulating psycho, and completely steels the show. What bugs me a bit though is the constant rendezvous between Michal and Garcia, were Garcia has several opportunities to shoot him but hesitate afraid that he won't get the bone marrow he needs to he's soon. I would expect even a cop know you can actually kneecap someone and they'll live. That drags the movie down a bit, the days when you could get away with the good and the bad guy constantly running into each other, were long gone even when this film was made Not to mention that Andy's character would never been able to continue on the force, not to mention he would probable been sued. The survivors or victims of he's desperate try to keep Keaton alive, just so he could save he's son. Personally, I would have made sure Andy didn't get he's bone marrow, simply cause he leaves a wake of dead and injured people. But all in all it's a good thriller.

    This movie is seriously UNDERRATED/OVERLOOKED by people. I've always liked/enjoyed this movie as an Action/Thriller. I thought the action,cast,story was good. Giving this movie crap is a reason why I cant stand Movie Critics who just waste time over Box Office Numbers and Reviewing movies then just watching it and enjoying the movie like I do as Movie lover. I can name a lot of movies over the past 2/3 decades that are underrated that don't get enough credit. Andy Garcia,Michael K/Joseph Cross from Jack Frost as well I thought they all did well in their scene's including the finale. Thats why I hate movies Like the Dark Knight,Twilight many others that are so overrated in terms of reviews,awards,box office

    Desperate Measures is an action thriller film that stars Michael Keaton, Andy Garc&iacute;a, Marcia Gay Harden and Brian Cox.The film was directed by Barbet Schroeder. It was filmed in both the San Francisco Bay Area and downtown Pittsburgh. Garcia stars as Frank Conner, a widowed San Francisco police officer whose young son Matt is suffering from leukemia. Without a bone marrow transplant, Matt will die, but Frank isn't a donor. In fact, the only potential match is prison inmate Peter McCabe (Keaton), a psychotic but charming serial killer. At first, McCabe refused to participate despite Conner's pleas, but eventually, the convict relents and agrees to the procedure. It is all a ruse, however, as McCabe has discovered a clever way to escape the confines of the operating room where Matt's oncologist, Dr. Hawkins (Harden) is scheduled to perform the transplant. Faced with the dual nightmare of his son's deteriorating condition and a mass murderer on the loose in a major metropolitan hospital, the frantic Conner finds himself bending and even breaking the law to bring McCabe down and save Matt's life. Too bad that the film is only masquerading as a thoughtful movie that's really about something. At heart, it's an action thriller--a chase picture. It has all the usual implausible or impossible stunts, the highway carnage, the jumps off bridges, the slides down laundry chutes, and other feats that make it more of a video game than a drama.This unfortunately makes it an average picture that would thrill action fans.

With McCabe's escape, the entire hospital becomes a battleground and Connor must pursue and, ironically, protect the deadly fugitive who is his son's only hope for survival.... What we have here is essentially a chase movie. Schroeder is a great director, but it seems that he has just sat back and let the actors do what they do. Keaton and Garcia are great as the two leads, and Keaton arguably plays one of his greatest roles. He's usually the nice dependable guy who just likes the easy life, but here, he's just gone all out in his portrayal. He's no Hannibal Lecter, which in some scenes he's clearly trying to be (there is even mention of him getting in your head), but nevertheless he seems more human than your usual nut-job. Garcia too is very good as the desperate dad, and both are ably supported by the rest of the cast. If you can forgive some really silly parts in the film and can forget plausibility for ninety minutes, you are going to get a rollicking good movie. It's a shame that this was overlooked in the cinemas, because it really is a treat to watch. If you get a chance to see it, please do.

    michael keaton proved how good he is when he has the role of a bad guy, a criminal, a tough guy, when he starred in Pacific Heights. he's a very strong and believable character. i think that in this movie, he did better acting than andy garcia (but he was good too). i wish that michael keaton would do more bad-guy roles as well as something entirely different: a drama or comedy perhaps, so that he could expand the roles that he is good at doing. well, about this movie: i do not mind one iota that the F word is used so prolifically in Casino that it is like you hear it 100 times. it is the perfect word for the characters to use in THAT movie. but i dislike swearing used in dialogue just to get the audience charged up. it's like when violence or sex scenes do not seem to have a place: they are just used to keep us interested. but this movie, Desperate Measures, is just filled with the F word, and you notice it like a broken thumb because it doesn't belong in the sentences. in fact, the dialogue as a whole would have been more powerful without that word. therefore, although this movie is somewhat tense, i've seen tenser thrillers/crime movies that have no swearing whatsoever in them. is this sort of screenplay writing simply another indication of the decline of the once wealthy, respected, and powerful status of the USA? because, that is what it sounds like. the story in this movie is good. *** SPOILER: the plot is similar to John Q with denzel washington. *** END OF SPOILER. the actors are good. there are holes in the story, but the excitement gets you going so that you do not notice them until your hour after watching it, pondering over the plot. it is not that bad and it is not that good. i would not recommend your spending the amount of a theater ticket on this movie, but to watch it on cable, free of charge (with no other interesting movie to take up your time), is not ALL THAT BAD. it's a fair experience.

    The title of my review says it all, really. Shroeder and Klass took a type of movie that usually doesn't surpass the level of popcorn entertainment (which is fine), and delivered a movie that can still be enjoyed with some good popcorn, but at the same time subverts the genre script-wise and in terms of editing, by constantly confusing the viewer's sense of who to root for, and adds aesthetic depth in terms of very cool shots, situations and cuts. You'll hate this if you're the high falutin' critic type, but if you come prepared to see a popcorn action movie that happens to be shown through the eyes of Barbet f*cking Shroeder, you're in the right place.

    This fast paced, exciting and gripping movie was written by David Klass and directed by Barbet Schroeder. It relates the story of Frank Connor, (Andy Garcia) a police detective who's son is desperately ill and needs a bone marrow transplant. However, when the perfect donor is located, it turns out he's in a maximum security prison and belongs to one, Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton). McCabe is a serious minded, multiple murderer who's I.Q. is in the genius range. Connor's is desperate enough to try anything to save his son and that includes releasing the prisoner from his maximum enclosure, long enough to extract the necessary ingredient while under the most stringent security measures available. However, despite the nearly impregnable restrains, McCabe is incredibly versatile, crafty and learns the weaknesses of his jailers, enough to exploit their mistakes and take advantage of their ignorance. From the moment the prisoner is removed from his incarceration, the audience is given an explosive, action-oriented and dramatic film which makes for a great escape. Keaton is magnificent and his role will surely make this effort a Classic. ****

    Call it "Desperate Movie," because this ludicrous thriller deteriorates into unintentional comedy. For reasons that are never explained, a sociopath killer (Michael Keaton) is the only available bone marrow donor for the cancer-stricken son of a San Francisco cop (Andy Garcia), who must capture the killer alive after a laughable escape in a labyrinthine hospital. The ensuing manhunt relies on plentiful plot holes and ridiculous shortcuts (like Keaton's use of a surgical laser to cut leg irons, or accessing hospital schematics from a prison computer). Self-consciously shot in film noir style, the cat-and-mouse routine leads to a briefly impressive car chase, but the premise (which even the movie's original press notes described as "intriguing, if unlikely") is based on "moral ambiguity" that doesn't translate from script to screen. Instead of forcing Keaton's typically "sick genius" to prove his ingenuity, the film pits him against a squad of cops who couldn't find a beer in a crowded pub.

    Well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof. To summarize things up, cop/dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal(Michael Keaton). well criminal agrees BUT escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop-dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son. (dead criminal-no transplant-dead son). well, the police in this movie doesn't have a brain, in case they never heard of a TAZER to knock off the criminal without killing him. end of movie, as simple as that. But it when all crazy and stupid including the death of 2cops and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly.

    This movie is seriously UNDERRATED/OVERLOOKED by people. I've always liked/enjoyed this movie as an Action/Thriller. I thought the action,cast,story was good. Giving this movie crap is a reason why I cant stand Movie Critics who just waste time over Box Office Numbers and Reviewing movies then just watching it and enjoying the movie like I do as Movie lover. I can name a lot of movies over the past 2/3 decades that are underrated that don't get enough credit. Andy Garcia,Michael K/Joseph Cross from Jack Frost as well I thought they all did well in their scene's including the finale. Thats why I hate movies Like the Dark Knight,Twilight many others that are so overrated in terms of reviews,awards,box office

    Desperate Measures is an action thriller film that stars Michael Keaton, Andy Garc&iacute;a, Marcia Gay Harden and Brian Cox.The film was directed by Barbet Schroeder. It was filmed in both the San Francisco Bay Area and downtown Pittsburgh. Garcia stars as Frank Conner, a widowed San Francisco police officer whose young son Matt is suffering from leukemia. Without a bone marrow transplant, Matt will die, but Frank isn't a donor. In fact, the only potential match is prison inmate Peter McCabe (Keaton), a psychotic but charming serial killer. At first, McCabe refused to participate despite Conner's pleas, but eventually, the convict relents and agrees to the procedure. It is all a ruse, however, as McCabe has discovered a clever way to escape the confines of the operating room where Matt's oncologist, Dr. Hawkins (Harden) is scheduled to perform the transplant. Faced with the dual nightmare of his son's deteriorating condition and a mass murderer on the loose in a major metropolitan hospital, the frantic Conner finds himself bending and even breaking the law to bring McCabe down and save Matt's life. Too bad that the film is only masquerading as a thoughtful movie that's really about something. At heart, it's an action thriller--a chase picture. It has all the usual implausible or impossible stunts, the highway carnage, the jumps off bridges, the slides down laundry chutes, and other feats that make it more of a video game than a drama.This unfortunately makes it an average picture that would thrill action fans.

    San Francisco police officer Frank Connor is in a frantic search for a compatible bone marrow donor for his gravely ill son. There's only one catch: the potential donor is convicted multiple murderer Peter McCabe who sees a trip to the hospital as the perfect opportunity to get what he wants most: freedom. With McCabe's escape, the entire hospital becomes a battleground and Connor must pursue and, ironically, protect the deadly fugitive who is his son's only hope for survival.... What we have here is essentially a chase movie. Schroeder is a great director, but it seems that he has just sat back and let the actors do what they do. Keaton and Garcia are great as the two leads, and Keaton arguably plays one of his greatest roles. He's usually the nice dependable guy who just likes the easy life, but here, he's just gone all out in his portrayal. He's no Hannibal Lecter, which in some scenes he's clearly trying to be (there is even mention of him getting in your head), but nevertheless he seems more human than your usual nut-job. Garcia too is very good as the desperate dad, and both are ably supported by the rest of the cast. If you can forgive some really silly parts in the film and can forget plausibility for ninety minutes, you are going to get a rollicking good movie. It's a shame that this was overlooked in the cinemas, because it really is a treat to watch. If you get a chance to see it, please do.

    michael keaton proved how good he is when he has the role of a bad guy, a criminal, a tough guy, when he starred in Pacific Heights. he's a very strong and believable character. i think that in this movie, he did better acting than andy garcia (but he was good too). i wish that michael keaton would do more bad-guy roles as well as something entirely different: a drama or comedy perhaps, so that he could expand the roles that he is good at doing. well, about this movie: i do not mind one iota that the F word is used so prolifically in Casino that it is like you hear it 100 times. it is the perfect word for the characters to use in THAT movie. but i dislike swearing used in dialogue just to get the audience charged up. it's like when violence or sex scenes do not seem to have a place: they are just used to keep us interested. but this movie, Desperate Measures, is just filled with the F word, and you notice it like a broken thumb because it doesn't belong in the sentences. in fact, the dialogue as a whole would have been more powerful without that word. therefore, although this movie is somewhat tense, i've seen tenser thrillers/crime movies that have no swearing whatsoever in them. is this sort of screenplay writing simply another indication of the decline of the once wealthy, respected, and powerful status of the USA? because, that is what it sounds like. the story in this movie is good. *** SPOILER: the plot is similar to John Q with denzel washington. *** END OF SPOILER. the actors are good. there are holes in the story, but the excitement gets you going so that you do not notice them until your hour after watching it, pondering over the plot. it is not that bad and it is not that good. i would not recommend your spending the amount of a theater ticket on this movie, but to watch it on cable, free of charge (with no other interesting movie to take up your time), is not ALL THAT BAD. it's a fair experience.

    The title of my review says it all, really. Shroeder and Klass took a type of movie that usually doesn't surpass the level of popcorn entertainment (which is fine), and delivered a movie that can still be enjoyed with some good popcorn, but at the same time subverts the genre script-wise and in terms of editing, by constantly confusing the viewer's sense of who to root for, and adds aesthetic depth in terms of very cool shots, situations and cuts. You'll hate this if you're the high falutin' critic type, but if you come prepared to see a popcorn action movie that happens to be shown through the eyes of Barbet f*cking Shroeder, you're in the right place.

    This fast paced, exciting and gripping movie was written by David Klass and directed by Barbet Schroeder. It relates the story of Frank Connor, (Andy Garcia) a police detective who's son is desperately ill and needs a bone marrow transplant. However, when the perfect donor is located, it turns out he's in a maximum security prison and belongs to one, Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton). McCabe is a serious minded, multiple murderer who's I.Q. is in the genius range. Connor's is desperate enough to try anything to save his son and that includes releasing the prisoner from his maximum enclosure, long enough to extract the necessary ingredient while under the most stringent security measures available. However, despite the nearly impregnable restrains, McCabe is incredibly versatile, crafty and learns the weaknesses of his jailers, enough to exploit their mistakes and take advantage of their ignorance. From the moment the prisoner is removed from his incarceration, the audience is given an explosive, action-oriented and dramatic film which makes for a great escape. Keaton is magnificent and his role will surely make this effort a Classic. ****

    Call it "Desperate Movie," because this ludicrous thriller deteriorates into unintentional comedy. For reasons that are never explained, a sociopath killer (Michael Keaton) is the only available bone marrow donor for the cancer-stricken son of a San Francisco cop (Andy Garcia), who must capture the killer alive after a laughable escape in a labyrinthine hospital. The ensuing manhunt relies on plentiful plot holes and ridiculous shortcuts (like Keaton's use of a surgical laser to cut leg irons, or accessing hospital schematics from a prison computer). Self-consciously shot in film noir style, the cat-and-mouse routine leads to a briefly impressive car chase, but the premise (which even the movie's original press notes described as "intriguing, if unlikely") is based on "moral ambiguity" that doesn't translate from script to screen. Instead of forcing Keaton's typically "sick genius" to prove his ingenuity, the film pits him against a squad of cops who couldn't find a beer in a crowded pub.

    Well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof. To summarize things up, cop/dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal(Michael Keaton). well criminal agrees BUT escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop-dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son. (dead criminal-no transplant-dead son). well, the police in this movie doesn't have a brain, in case they never heard of a TAZER to knock off the criminal without killing him. end of movie, as simple as that. But it when all crazy and stupid including the death of 2cops and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly.

    Desperate Measures This thriller is a fast and intense paced movie, which is often overlooked Andy Garcia does a great job playing desperate dad, trying to save he's leukemia ridden son. And Michal Keaton does an even better job playing manipulating psycho, and completely steels the show. What bugs me a bit though is the constant rendezvous between Michal and Garcia, were Garcia has several opportunities to shoot him but hesitate afraid that he won't get the bone marrow he needs to he's soon. I would expect even a cop know you can actually kneecap someone and they'll live. That drags the movie down a bit, the days when you could get away with the good and the bad guy constantly running into each other, were long gone even when this film was made Not to mention that Andy's character would never been able to continue on the force, not to mention he would probable been sued. The survivors or victims of he's desperate try to keep Keaton alive, just so he could save he's son. Personally, I would have made sure Andy didn't get he's bone marrow, simply cause he leaves a wake of dead and injured people. But all in all it's a good thriller.

If you can forgive some really silly parts in the film and can forget plausibility for ninety minutes, you are going to get a rollicking good movie. It's a shame that this was overlooked in the cinemas, because it really is a treat to watch. If you get a chance to see it, please do.

    michael keaton proved how good he is when he has the role of a bad guy, a criminal, a tough guy, when he starred in Pacific Heights. he's a very strong and believable character. i think that in this movie, he did better acting than andy garcia (but he was good too). i wish that michael keaton would do more bad-guy roles as well as something entirely different: a drama or comedy perhaps, so that he could expand the roles that he is good at doing. well, about this movie: i do not mind one iota that the F word is used so prolifically in Casino that it is like you hear it 100 times. it is the perfect word for the characters to use in THAT movie. but i dislike swearing used in dialogue just to get the audience charged up. it's like when violence or sex scenes do not seem to have a place: they are just used to keep us interested. but this movie, Desperate Measures, is just filled with the F word, and you notice it like a broken thumb because it doesn't belong in the sentences. in fact, the dialogue as a whole would have been more powerful without that word. therefore, although this movie is somewhat tense, i've seen tenser thrillers/crime movies that have no swearing whatsoever in them. is this sort of screenplay writing simply another indication of the decline of the once wealthy, respected, and powerful status of the USA? because, that is what it sounds like. the story in this movie is good. *** SPOILER: the plot is similar to John Q with denzel washington. *** END OF SPOILER. the actors are good. there are holes in the story, but the excitement gets you going so that you do not notice them until your hour after watching it, pondering over the plot. it is not that bad and it is not that good. i would not recommend your spending the amount of a theater ticket on this movie, but to watch it on cable, free of charge (with no other interesting movie to take up your time), is not ALL THAT BAD. it's a fair experience.

    The title of my review says it all, really. Shroeder and Klass took a type of movie that usually doesn't surpass the level of popcorn entertainment (which is fine), and delivered a movie that can still be enjoyed with some good popcorn, but at the same time subverts the genre script-wise and in terms of editing, by constantly confusing the viewer's sense of who to root for, and adds aesthetic depth in terms of very cool shots, situations and cuts. You'll hate this if you're the high falutin' critic type, but if you come prepared to see a popcorn action movie that happens to be shown through the eyes of Barbet f*cking Shroeder, you're in the right place.

    This fast paced, exciting and gripping movie was written by David Klass and directed by Barbet Schroeder. It relates the story of Frank Connor, (Andy Garcia) a police detective who's son is desperately ill and needs a bone marrow transplant. However, when the perfect donor is located, it turns out he's in a maximum security prison and belongs to one, Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton). McCabe is a serious minded, multiple murderer who's I.Q. is in the genius range. Connor's is desperate enough to try anything to save his son and that includes releasing the prisoner from his maximum enclosure, long enough to extract the necessary ingredient while under the most stringent security measures available. However, despite the nearly impregnable restrains, McCabe is incredibly versatile, crafty and learns the weaknesses of his jailers, enough to exploit their mistakes and take advantage of their ignorance. From the moment the prisoner is removed from his incarceration, the audience is given an explosive, action-oriented and dramatic film which makes for a great escape. Keaton is magnificent and his role will surely make this effort a Classic. ****

    Call it "Desperate Movie," because this ludicrous thriller deteriorates into unintentional comedy. For reasons that are never explained, a sociopath killer (Michael Keaton) is the only available bone marrow donor for the cancer-stricken son of a San Francisco cop (Andy Garcia), who must capture the killer alive after a laughable escape in a labyrinthine hospital. The ensuing manhunt relies on plentiful plot holes and ridiculous shortcuts (like Keaton's use of a surgical laser to cut leg irons, or accessing hospital schematics from a prison computer). Self-consciously shot in film noir style, the cat-and-mouse routine leads to a briefly impressive car chase, but the premise (which even the movie's original press notes described as "intriguing, if unlikely") is based on "moral ambiguity" that doesn't translate from script to screen. Instead of forcing Keaton's typically "sick genius" to prove his ingenuity, the film pits him against a squad of cops who couldn't find a beer in a crowded pub.

    Well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof. To summarize things up, cop/dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal(Michael Keaton). well criminal agrees BUT escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop-dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son. (dead criminal-no transplant-dead son). well, the police in this movie doesn't have a brain, in case they never heard of a TAZER to knock off the criminal without killing him. end of movie, as simple as that. But it when all crazy and stupid including the death of 2cops and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly.

    Desperate Measures This thriller is a fast and intense paced movie, which is often overlooked Andy Garcia does a great job playing desperate dad, trying to save he's leukemia ridden son. And Michal Keaton does an even better job playing manipulating psycho, and completely steels the show. What bugs me a bit though is the constant rendezvous between Michal and Garcia, were Garcia has several opportunities to shoot him but hesitate afraid that he won't get the bone marrow he needs to he's soon. I would expect even a cop know you can actually kneecap someone and they'll live. That drags the movie down a bit, the days when you could get away with the good and the bad guy constantly running into each other, were long gone even when this film was made Not to mention that Andy's character would never been able to continue on the force, not to mention he would probable been sued. The survivors or victims of he's desperate try to keep Keaton alive, just so he could save he's son. Personally, I would have made sure Andy didn't get he's bone marrow, simply cause he leaves a wake of dead and injured people. But all in all it's a good thriller.

    This movie is seriously UNDERRATED/OVERLOOKED by people. I've always liked/enjoyed this movie as an Action/Thriller. I thought the action,cast,story was good. Giving this movie crap is a reason why I cant stand Movie Critics who just waste time over Box Office Numbers and Reviewing movies then just watching it and enjoying the movie like I do as Movie lover. I can name a lot of movies over the past 2/3 decades that are underrated that don't get enough credit. Andy Garcia,Michael K/Joseph Cross from Jack Frost as well I thought they all did well in their scene's including the finale. Thats why I hate movies Like the Dark Knight,Twilight many others that are so overrated in terms of reviews,awards,box office

    Desperate Measures is an action thriller film that stars Michael Keaton, Andy Garc&iacute;a, Marcia Gay Harden and Brian Cox.The film was directed by Barbet Schroeder. It was filmed in both the San Francisco Bay Area and downtown Pittsburgh. Garcia stars as Frank Conner, a widowed San Francisco police officer whose young son Matt is suffering from leukemia. Without a bone marrow transplant, Matt will die, but Frank isn't a donor. In fact, the only potential match is prison inmate Peter McCabe (Keaton), a psychotic but charming serial killer. At first, McCabe refused to participate despite Conner's pleas, but eventually, the convict relents and agrees to the procedure. It is all a ruse, however, as McCabe has discovered a clever way to escape the confines of the operating room where Matt's oncologist, Dr. Hawkins (Harden) is scheduled to perform the transplant. Faced with the dual nightmare of his son's deteriorating condition and a mass murderer on the loose in a major metropolitan hospital, the frantic Conner finds himself bending and even breaking the law to bring McCabe down and save Matt's life. Too bad that the film is only masquerading as a thoughtful movie that's really about something. At heart, it's an action thriller--a chase picture. It has all the usual implausible or impossible stunts, the highway carnage, the jumps off bridges, the slides down laundry chutes, and other feats that make it more of a video game than a drama.This unfortunately makes it an average picture that would thrill action fans.

    San Francisco police officer Frank Connor is in a frantic search for a compatible bone marrow donor for his gravely ill son. There's only one catch: the potential donor is convicted multiple murderer Peter McCabe who sees a trip to the hospital as the perfect opportunity to get what he wants most: freedom. With McCabe's escape, the entire hospital becomes a battleground and Connor must pursue and, ironically, protect the deadly fugitive who is his son's only hope for survival.... What we have here is essentially a chase movie. Schroeder is a great director, but it seems that he has just sat back and let the actors do what they do. Keaton and Garcia are great as the two leads, and Keaton arguably plays one of his greatest roles. He's usually the nice dependable guy who just likes the easy life, but here, he's just gone all out in his portrayal. He's no Hannibal Lecter, which in some scenes he's clearly trying to be (there is even mention of him getting in your head), but nevertheless he seems more human than your usual nut-job. Garcia too is very good as the desperate dad, and both are ably supported by the rest of the cast.

    This fast paced, exciting and gripping movie was written by David Klass and directed by Barbet Schroeder. It relates the story of Frank Connor, (Andy Garcia) a police detective who's son is desperately ill and needs a bone marrow transplant. However, when the perfect donor is located, it turns out he's in a maximum security prison and belongs to one, Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton). McCabe is a serious minded, multiple murderer who's I.Q. is in the genius range. Connor's is desperate enough to try anything to save his son and that includes releasing the prisoner from his maximum enclosure, long enough to extract the necessary ingredient while under the most stringent security measures available. However, despite the nearly impregnable restrains, McCabe is incredibly versatile, crafty and learns the weaknesses of his jailers, enough to exploit their mistakes and take advantage of their ignorance. From the moment the prisoner is removed from his incarceration, the audience is given an explosive, action-oriented and dramatic film which makes for a great escape. Keaton is magnificent and his role will surely make this effort a Classic. ****

    Call it "Desperate Movie," because this ludicrous thriller deteriorates into unintentional comedy. For reasons that are never explained, a sociopath killer (Michael Keaton) is the only available bone marrow donor for the cancer-stricken son of a San Francisco cop (Andy Garcia), who must capture the killer alive after a laughable escape in a labyrinthine hospital. The ensuing manhunt relies on plentiful plot holes and ridiculous shortcuts (like Keaton's use of a surgical laser to cut leg irons, or accessing hospital schematics from a prison computer). Self-consciously shot in film noir style, the cat-and-mouse routine leads to a briefly impressive car chase, but the premise (which even the movie's original press notes described as "intriguing, if unlikely") is based on "moral ambiguity" that doesn't translate from script to screen. Instead of forcing Keaton's typically "sick genius" to prove his ingenuity, the film pits him against a squad of cops who couldn't find a beer in a crowded pub.

    Well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof. To summarize things up, cop/dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal(Michael Keaton). well criminal agrees BUT escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop-dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son. (dead criminal-no transplant-dead son). well, the police in this movie doesn't have a brain, in case they never heard of a TAZER to knock off the criminal without killing him. end of movie, as simple as that. But it when all crazy and stupid including the death of 2cops and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly.

    in fact,it's downright ludicrous at times.and the acting isn't very good.the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired,too.though i'll admit,the movie is somewhat suspenseful at times.but when you have one stupid predictable plot twist after another every few minutes,it just becomes tiresome.there really isn't much point to this movie.it's also too long by at least 30 minutes,so that doesn't help.Michael Keaton plays a good villain,but i think the filmmakers were trying to make him into something akin to Hannibal Lector,from Silence of the Lambs.well,they feel short by a country mile.it's a shame the movie wasn't better,since there were some good actors involved.oh,well.for me,Desperate Measures is a 4/10

    Desperate Measures This thriller is a fast and intense paced movie, which is often overlooked Andy Garcia does a great job playing desperate dad, trying to save he's leukemia ridden son. And Michal Keaton does an even better job playing manipulating psycho, and completely steels the show. What bugs me a bit though is the constant rendezvous between Michal and Garcia, were Garcia has several opportunities to shoot him but hesitate afraid that he won't get the bone marrow he needs to he's soon. I would expect even a cop know you can actually kneecap someone and they'll live. That drags the movie down a bit, the days when you could get away with the good and the bad guy constantly running into each other, were long gone even when this film was made Not to mention that Andy's character would never been able to continue on the force, not to mention he would probable been sued. The survivors or victims of he's desperate try to keep Keaton alive, just so he could save he's son. Personally, I would have made sure Andy didn't get he's bone marrow, simply cause he leaves a wake of dead and injured people. But all in all it's a good thriller.

    This movie is seriously UNDERRATED/OVERLOOKED by people. I've always liked/enjoyed this movie as an Action/Thriller. I thought the action,cast,story was good. Giving this movie crap is a reason why I cant stand Movie Critics who just waste time over Box Office Numbers and Reviewing movies then just watching it and enjoying the movie like I do as Movie lover. I can name a lot of movies over the past 2/3 decades that are underrated that don't get enough credit. Andy Garcia,Michael K/Joseph Cross from Jack Frost as well I thought they all did well in their scene's including the finale. Thats why I hate movies Like the Dark Knight,Twilight many others that are so overrated in terms of reviews,awards,box office

    Desperate Measures is an action thriller film that stars Michael Keaton, Andy Garc&iacute;a, Marcia Gay Harden and Brian Cox.The film was directed by Barbet Schroeder. It was filmed in both the San Francisco Bay Area and downtown Pittsburgh. Garcia stars as Frank Conner, a widowed San Francisco police officer whose young son Matt is suffering from leukemia. Without a bone marrow transplant, Matt will die, but Frank isn't a donor. In fact, the only potential match is prison inmate Peter McCabe (Keaton), a psychotic but charming serial killer. At first, McCabe refused to participate despite Conner's pleas, but eventually, the convict relents and agrees to the procedure. It is all a ruse, however, as McCabe has discovered a clever way to escape the confines of the operating room where Matt's oncologist, Dr. Hawkins (Harden) is scheduled to perform the transplant. Faced with the dual nightmare of his son's deteriorating condition and a mass murderer on the loose in a major metropolitan hospital, the frantic Conner finds himself bending and even breaking the law to bring McCabe down and save Matt's life. Too bad that the film is only masquerading as a thoughtful movie that's really about something. At heart, it's an action thriller--a chase picture. It has all the usual implausible or impossible stunts, the highway carnage, the jumps off bridges, the slides down laundry chutes, and other feats that make it more of a video game than a drama.This unfortunately makes it an average picture that would thrill action fans.

    San Francisco police officer Frank Connor is in a frantic search for a compatible bone marrow donor for his gravely ill son. There's only one catch: the potential donor is convicted multiple murderer Peter McCabe who sees a trip to the hospital as the perfect opportunity to get what he wants most: freedom. With McCabe's escape, the entire hospital becomes a battleground and Connor must pursue and, ironically, protect the deadly fugitive who is his son's only hope for survival.... What we have here is essentially a chase movie. Schroeder is a great director, but it seems that he has just sat back and let the actors do what they do. Keaton and Garcia are great as the two leads, and Keaton arguably plays one of his greatest roles. He's usually the nice dependable guy who just likes the easy life, but here, he's just gone all out in his portrayal. He's no Hannibal Lecter, which in some scenes he's clearly trying to be (there is even mention of him getting in your head), but nevertheless he seems more human than your usual nut-job. Garcia too is very good as the desperate dad, and both are ably supported by the rest of the cast. If you can forgive some really silly parts in the film and can forget plausibility for ninety minutes, you are going to get a rollicking good movie. It's a shame that this was overlooked in the cinemas, because it really is a treat to watch. If you get a chance to see it, please do.

    michael keaton proved how good he is when he has the role of a bad guy, a criminal, a tough guy, when he starred in Pacific Heights. he's a very strong and believable character. i think that in this movie, he did better acting than andy garcia (but he was good too). i wish that michael keaton would do more bad-guy roles as well as something entirely different: a drama or comedy perhaps, so that he could expand the roles that he is good at doing. well, about this movie: i do not mind one iota that the F word is used so prolifically in Casino that it is like you hear it 100 times. it is the perfect word for the characters to use in THAT movie. but i dislike swearing used in dialogue just to get the audience charged up. it's like when violence or sex scenes do not seem to have a place: they are just used to keep us interested. but this movie, Desperate Measures, is just filled with the F word, and you notice it like a broken thumb because it doesn't belong in the sentences. in fact, the dialogue as a whole would have been more powerful without that word. therefore, although this movie is somewhat tense, i've seen tenser thrillers/crime movies that have no swearing whatsoever in them. is this sort of screenplay writing simply another indication of the decline of the once wealthy, respected, and powerful status of the USA? because, that is what it sounds like. the story in this movie is good. *** SPOILER: the plot is similar to John Q with denzel washington. *** END OF SPOILER. the actors are good. there are holes in the story, but the excitement gets you going so that you do not notice them until your hour after watching it, pondering over the plot. it is not that bad and it is not that good. i would not recommend your spending the amount of a theater ticket on this movie, but to watch it on cable, free of charge (with no other interesting movie to take up your time), is not ALL THAT BAD. it's a fair experience.

    The title of my review says it all, really. Shroeder and Klass took a type of movie that usually doesn't surpass the level of popcorn entertainment (which is fine), and delivered a movie that can still be enjoyed with some good popcorn, but at the same time subverts the genre script-wise and in terms of editing, by constantly confusing the viewer's sense of who to root for, and adds aesthetic depth in terms of very cool shots, situations and cuts. You'll hate this if you're the high falutin' critic type, but if you come prepared to see a popcorn action movie that happens to be shown through the eyes of Barbet f*cking Shroeder, you're in the right place.
