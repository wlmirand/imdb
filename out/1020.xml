    Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, GASLIGHT was made in Great Britain four years previous to this version. Louis B Mayer was so taken with the play that he bought not only the film rights but also the distribution rights to the 1940 film, after which he locked it in the MGM vault so that it was not seen in the States for decades. It is interesting to compare the two versions: most critics seem to place the British original in higher esteem, but I disagree, mainly due to the performances of the two lead actors. Diana Wynyard, an old-style actress in the British tradition, gives a good but rather uninteresting performance; she spends most of the film in a state of near-catatonia which, frankly, gets old fast, while her co-star Anton Walbrook overacts shamelessly all over the place, which has the unfortunate effect of robbing the piece of much of its suspense. George Cukor, known as one of the best directors of actors of his day, makes a vast improvement in the acting in the 1944 version, though he may have gone slightly overboard in the case of Ingrid Bergman. She won her first Oscar for her performance in this film, but it is not her best work: an uneven performance that in spots is a tad bit hammy, something that Bergman practically NEVER did; she was a master at underplaying (see CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS). She's good in GASLIGHT, but as I have already stated in my review of that film, the actress who should have won the Award for 1944 should have been Barbara Stanwyck for her seminal performance as the ultimate femme fatale in Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Ironically, it isn't really Bergman who gives the best lead performance here: it's Boyer. Aside from a certain "sourpuss" expression on his face, at the beginning we have no idea what a monster this man is, nor do we have a clue as to what he is planning to do to his adoring young bride. As a result Cukor manages to drag out the suspense in an almost Hitchcock-like fashion until it becomes nearly unbearable. Boyer's Gregory Anton is one of the great screen villains; wearing the mask of a loving husband, he proceeds to drive his wife to the brink of madness in such an effective manner that the term "gaslighting" actually entered the vernacular, as in "He's gaslighting us (meaning "he's lying/misleading/playing us")." To relieve some of the darkness of the main plot, Cukor provides two comic relief characters: local busybody Miss Thwaites, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Dame May Witty, and housemaid Nancy, a saucy little tart who flirts openly with Gregory while at the same time not bothering to conceal her disdain for his wife. Angela Lansbury, all of eighteen years old and making her film debut, sank her teeth into the role of the trampy little bitch and got an Oscar nomination right out of the box for it. It is one of the most auspicious debuts of one of the greatest actresses Hollywood, Broadway, and television have ever been graced with. Also on hand to solve the mystery is Brian Cameron (the great Joseph Cotten in yet another of his fine performances), a Scotland Yard detective who as a young boy idolized Paula's aunt, a famous opera star who was brutally murdered when the girl was in her teens. All of this sounds like I am knocking Bergman, but I really don't mean to. She is one of my favorite actresses of all time, and her performance here is excellent; I am just not sure if it is Oscar-worthy. At any rate I still think Stanwyck should have won. And Bergman gave Oscar performances in many other films for which she was not always recognized with so much as a nomination: NOTORIOUS, CASABLANCA, and THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS come to mind, to mention only a few. At any rate, any film effective enough that its title becomes part of the language is obviously operating on a higher level than most films, Oscar or no Oscar.

    American audiences did not get to see the 1940 British version of "Angel Street" for many years after MGM planned its own version with an exciting cast, a famous director and its typical glossy production values. While a viewing of the 1940 version might cause some to put down its American remake, that version does stand out for excellent performances, lavish sets and costumes and lush photography, even if it comes up a bit short in what the 1940 version made up in far more recognizable technical achievements that make that version seem even newer than its remake. Poor Ingrid Bergman has memories of the murder of her aunt in her London home when she was much younger and has avoided stepping into the house for many years. A chance encounter with a newer resident of that street (Dame May Witty) brings back memories, and faster than Dame May can utter "Well!", Bergman is returning home with her new husband (Charles Boyer) who is all charm and culture on the outside but hiding a dangerous secret on the inside. No sooner have they remodeled the old homestead than Bergman seems to undergo some mental anguish. She is forgetful, apparently looses things, has crying spells for no apparent reason, and Boyer tells her he fears she is on the verge of loosing her mind, he claims, exactly like her mother did. A curious young man (Joseph Cotten) takes notice of Bergman and Boyer and ingratiates himself with the nosy neighbor Dame May while Boyer himself seems enamored of the new cockney maid (Angela Lansbury). This is as dark and Gothic as the title says, the "Gaslight" having two meanings: the form of artificial lighting which the pre-excessive electricity day world lived with, and a psychological manipulation of destroying another person by making them doubt their own sanity. Both Bergman and Boyer are outstanding, and she combines both vulnerability and confusion in her character who is certain she is not guilty of the things she has been accused of, even though there is no other explanation for them. Boyer's character switches early on from suave to suddenly sinister, taking away any romantic image you may have of him from such earlier classics as "Conquest" and "Love Affair". Dame May adds obvious comic relief, but her stereotypical nosy neighbor has more to do than just peak through curtains and swipe a strawberry from the deaf cook. As for brand new to the screen Lansbury, you won't soon forget the image of her in her truly trashy get-up, and the way she treats Bergman with such obvious contempt in spite of being employed by her makes her almost a Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") in training. Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to. While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior. As directed by George Cukor, this ends up a triumph that overshadowed the original version simply because MGM's head (Louis B. Mayer) kept the other version hid in preparation for the release of this version which he didn't want overshadowed.

    What an intense drama about psychological abuse, and implants the virulent dual-murders, one from the past and another is ongoing, one is fulfilled and the other is up in the air, George Cukor (from MY FAIR LADY 1964, 6/10; A STAR IS BORN 1954, 8/10 and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY 1940, 8/10) blindsided me with his own creation of film noir, and conducts Boyer and Bergman's career-best performances. An unsolved crime at the beginning, the film drops from a whodunit detective story rather early, after the a short spell of foreign sojourn (Lake Como, where else would be more romantic?), the newly-weds returns to London, for Paula (Bergman), the scar dooms to be lifted open and the bare wound is even more deleterious than she could ever imagine. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's play "ANGEL STREET", the film predominantly is a two-hander between Paula and Gregory (Boyer), and about how Gregory punctiliously and effectively manipulates and impairs Paula's mental state, he ensnares Paulo into a self-doubt of her sanity (the very first outing in London is to visit the torture chamber, no wonder all the Museums of Torture are prevailing in the touristic attractions here in Europe), insulating her from meeting other people, trapped her in the mansion and slowly yet mercilessly infuses all the hallucinogenic chicanery to further damage her flimsy nerve, which includes the titular gaslight and it also serves as a signpost of his surreptitious whereabout every night. Boyer is quite extraordinary in expressing venom under his high-and-mighty politeness, frowning and pouting, his devilish complexion enlivens the film's watchability even at its corniest part, a bestial man indeed, but a tour-de-force exemplar of his kind. Bergman, although is the hapless victim who is unwittingly sleeping with the enemy, very anti-femme- fatale indeed, manages to deliver a visceral transition of Paula's trauma, which certainly out of her usual graceful and elegant comfort zone, and albeit her Nordic height, it is such a stretch for her to reveal her female vulnerability without any reservation. She got her first Oscar for the film, I'm now wavering in choosing my pick between her and Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's noir paradigm DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10). A third-billed Joseph Cotten is the cardboard detective eventually will be the hero, and Dame May Witty, the garrulous busybody, appears sporadically in case she overstays her welcome. The film is also Angela Lansbury's film debut, at the age of 17 during the shoot, the young flighty maid might only be a pawn in the plot, but a rather singular boldness and an Oscar nomination presages her reverend orbit as one of the most versatile character-actress in the Hollywood history. Overall, the film is a highly-recommendable piece of psychological study, shot in minimal bleakness (even the gala concert is intentionally shortened) with solemn and choppy original score from Bronislau Kaper. From a modern-day POV, one might find Paula is a stereotyped exploitation about how women usually are portrayed in the yesteryear, which seems out of topicality now (not domestic violence, just the showcase of female's utter dependence and extreme delicacy), so, it might undermine the reception from the younger generation, but anyway, at least, a big bravo to Bergman and Boyer.

    In London, beautiful young Ingrid Bergman (as Paula Alquist) is taken away from 9 Thornton Square after the strangulation of her guardian aunt, a renowned opera singer. The murder is unsolved and a fortune in jewels disappears. Years later, Ms. Bergman takes singing lessons in Italy, hoping to follow in her aunt's footsteps. She falls in love with older French pianist Charles Boyer (as Gregory Anton). The newlyweds move to Bergman's inherited home in Thornton Square, site of the earlier tragedy. Lower class Angela Lansbury (as Nancy) and Barbara Everest (as Elizabeth) are hired as housekeeper and cook... The dimming of "Gaslight" and other mysteries ensue... Scotland Yard investigator Joseph Cotten (as Brian Cameron) is suspicious and elderly neighbor May Witty (as Miss Thwaites) is nosy. This is a re-make of the superior British "Gaslight" (1940). Although the leads often seem overly posed (it is, after all, seen through the productive lenses at MGM), all perform exceptionally for director George Cukor. Everything looks exquisite as photographed in black-and white by Joseph Ruttenberg. Bergman won a "Best Actress" Oscar for her high strung portrayal and Ms. Lansbury got a nomination in her first screen credit. ******** Gaslight (5/4/44) George Cukor ~ Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten, Angela Lansbury

    The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian! The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense. If on the ruins of our world, aliens from another planet were to some day enquire about the most representative Western movie ever made - it would be "Gaslight" (1944).

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman moves back into the house with her new husband. However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. If you ask me, this movie is great! Gaslight is a remarkable movie, it's a remarkable movie indeed! I watched this movie yesterday at it's a masterpiece that is directed by another one of the greatest directors of all time, George Cukor, the director of movies like My Fair Lady and The Philadelphia Story. Ingrid Bergman who appeared in Casablanca won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in this movie, as she was absolutely outstanding! We also have a great performance from Charles Boyer, who is trying to prove to Ingrid Bergman's character that she is absolutely mad. And George Cukor's directing is superb, as it usually is! Cukor was a genius, he was an absolute genius. This movie gets a ten out of ten from me, it's a marvelous movie directed by a great director and has a great cast too! In addition to the great acting and directing, the cinematography is stunning. As with most black and white movies, the cinematography adds a dark dramatic appearance to a movie, and in some cases, it even makes the movie a little bit eerie and creepy! But you want to know something? That's just the way that I like it, I love black and white cinematography, I love the dark appearances of the movies! Getting back to Gaslight, I can't think of one negative thing to say about it, as the acting, the cinematography, the directing, or in short, everything is so great, that it is impossible to think of anything that is not to like about the movie. I'll definitely add this movie to my list of great movies, as it is another movie that came out during the golden age of film. Nowadays, with only a few exceptions, they don't seem to make movies that way they used to make them, if they did, then maybe the film industry would be much more prosperous. So all in all, Gaslight is another movie that I can say is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I have heard nothing but great things about it, and all of these great things are absolutely true, as this movie really is a great movie! Gaslight is another movie that you must watch whenever you have the time to do so, as you will say that this movie is a great movie that you will not regret watching! Bravo to George Cukor, Charles Boyer, and especially to Ingrid Bergman for working together to film such a great movie! By the way, something I forget to mention, there are a few scenes in this movie that may leave you wanting to question your own sanity, and I really love a movie like that! In short, Gaslight is a movie that you should definitely watch if you haven't done so already, as it is an absolutely superb movie that exceeds on just about every single level that there is! 10/10

    I knew this film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but it was only after watching it I found out that the leading actress won the Oscar, so I was satisfied twice, from director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, Born Yesterday, A Star Is Born, My Fair Lady). Basically famous opera singer Alice Alquist has been murdered, and the perpetrator escaped without the hidden jewels he wanted, because young niece Paula (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ingrid Bergman) watched him commit the crime, she was being cared for following her mother's death. She travels to Italy to try and escape the memory of that terrible night at Number 9 Thornton Square in London, and she trains to become an opera star, and while doing this she meets and falls in love with Gregory Anton (Oscar nominated Charles Boyer). They eventually get married, and he convinces her that she should return home to London and to the house where the horrific incident happened, as it was bequeathed to her, and so that she can calm her anxieties, and all her aunt's possessions will be stashed in the attic. Moving into the house Paula comes across a letter addressed to her aunt, written two days before her murder from someone named Sergius Bauer, Gregory snatches this in a sudden violent way, but he calms and explains that he is only concerned about her. As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical. The young maid Nancy Oliver (Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury) is causing some stirring in the household as well, but there may be help in the form of undercover Scotland Yard Inspector Brian Cameron (The Third Man's Joseph Cotten) who is trying to get to the bottom of the murder, and the location of the missing jewels. He eventually gets close to Paula and convinces her that she may not be going mad after all, and she finds the letter that Gregory had taken from her, it turns out that Gregory is actually Sergius Bauer, he has been searching the attic for the jewels, and he murdered her aunt. The end sees Gregory finally caught for the murder he committed and attempting to steal the jewels that he did manage to find, and with him tied up Paula gets her own back by psychologically torturing him like he did to her. Also starring Barbara Everest as Elizabeth Tompkins, Eustace Wyatt as Budge, Emil Rameau as Maestro Guardi, Edmund Breon as General Huddleston, Halliwell Hobbes as Mr. Muffin, Tom Stevenson as Williams, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Lawrence Grossmith as Lord Dalroy and Jakob Gimpel as Pianist. Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Ingrid Bergman was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!

    a thief, a innocent young woman, a hero. and strange psychological war. a noir but, more that, perfect show of two great actors. because all is in right place, tension as result of details, music, atmosphere, circle of terror and ambiguous pieces of reality. the rules of seduction and the web of spider. the fragility of Ingrid Bergman is part of subtle game of illusion and suffering. Charles Boyer - like insidious snake - creates one of his most precise characters. Angela Lansburry - in one of her roles - is a good surprise. in this conditions, it is more than a good movie. it is example of perfect use of ordinaries ingredients and, in same time, slice of refined art.

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman (Ingrid Bergman) moves back into the house with her new husband (Charles Boyer). However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. I think this is a very different kind of mystery. It involves a murder, but there is never really any doubt about the killer. And it involves a wife thinking she is going crazy, yet we know all along that she is not. (In fact, despite the praise she has received, I think Bergman overdid it a little bit on her acting here... I found it hard to believe that she was that stupid.) Placing the film in the same era as the Jack the Ripper murders was a nice touch, as it could just have easily been the 1940s and the plot would not have been substantially altered. And the debut of Angela Lansbury? Truly remarkable. Who knew she had such a cockney accent inside her? Great film... a very solid performance from very solid talents. George Cukor never fails to succeed.

    To prevent Blacklisting, possibly a spoiler comment. If you are still reading, I watched this film because I am writing a book on Narcissism. Although it is not mentioned in the film description many feel this is where the Narcissistic term, "Gaslighting" comes from. As the film is unfolding and we see the Psychological torture Paula is undergoing through the hands of her husband Gregory, we are left to ponder, why would someone that loves you do this to you on purpose? It is a toxic environment that would slowly drive anyone mad. The wife, Paula, feels as though it is not real or she is somehow imagining it. Unless you have lived through this yourself, I unfortunately have, it is hard to wrap yourself around how torturous this feeling is. It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...

    American audiences did not get to see the 1940 British version of "Angel Street" for many years after MGM planned its own version with an exciting cast, a famous director and its typical glossy production values. While a viewing of the 1940 version might cause some to put down its American remake, that version does stand out for excellent performances, lavish sets and costumes and lush photography, even if it comes up a bit short in what the 1940 version made up in far more recognizable technical achievements that make that version seem even newer than its remake. Poor Ingrid Bergman has memories of the murder of her aunt in her London home when she was much younger and has avoided stepping into the house for many years. A chance encounter with a newer resident of that street (Dame May Witty) brings back memories, and faster than Dame May can utter "Well!", Bergman is returning home with her new husband (Charles Boyer) who is all charm and culture on the outside but hiding a dangerous secret on the inside. No sooner have they remodeled the old homestead than Bergman seems to undergo some mental anguish. She is forgetful, apparently looses things, has crying spells for no apparent reason, and Boyer tells her he fears she is on the verge of loosing her mind, he claims, exactly like her mother did. A curious young man (Joseph Cotten) takes notice of Bergman and Boyer and ingratiates himself with the nosy neighbor Dame May while Boyer himself seems enamored of the new cockney maid (Angela Lansbury). This is as dark and Gothic as the title says, the "Gaslight" having two meanings: the form of artificial lighting which the pre-excessive electricity day world lived with, and a psychological manipulation of destroying another person by making them doubt their own sanity. Both Bergman and Boyer are outstanding, and she combines both vulnerability and confusion in her character who is certain she is not guilty of the things she has been accused of, even though there is no other explanation for them. Boyer's character switches early on from suave to suddenly sinister, taking away any romantic image you may have of him from such earlier classics as "Conquest" and "Love Affair". Dame May adds obvious comic relief, but her stereotypical nosy neighbor has more to do than just peak through curtains and swipe a strawberry from the deaf cook. As for brand new to the screen Lansbury, you won't soon forget the image of her in her truly trashy get-up, and the way she treats Bergman with such obvious contempt in spite of being employed by her makes her almost a Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") in training. Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to. While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior. As directed by George Cukor, this ends up a triumph that overshadowed the original version simply because MGM's head (Louis B. Mayer) kept the other version hid in preparation for the release of this version which he didn't want overshadowed.

    What an intense drama about psychological abuse, and implants the virulent dual-murders, one from the past and another is ongoing, one is fulfilled and the other is up in the air, George Cukor (from MY FAIR LADY 1964, 6/10; A STAR IS BORN 1954, 8/10 and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY 1940, 8/10) blindsided me with his own creation of film noir, and conducts Boyer and Bergman's career-best performances. An unsolved crime at the beginning, the film drops from a whodunit detective story rather early, after the a short spell of foreign sojourn (Lake Como, where else would be more romantic?), the newly-weds returns to London, for Paula (Bergman), the scar dooms to be lifted open and the bare wound is even more deleterious than she could ever imagine. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's play "ANGEL STREET", the film predominantly is a two-hander between Paula and Gregory (Boyer), and about how Gregory punctiliously and effectively manipulates and impairs Paula's mental state, he ensnares Paulo into a self-doubt of her sanity (the very first outing in London is to visit the torture chamber, no wonder all the Museums of Torture are prevailing in the touristic attractions here in Europe), insulating her from meeting other people, trapped her in the mansion and slowly yet mercilessly infuses all the hallucinogenic chicanery to further damage her flimsy nerve, which includes the titular gaslight and it also serves as a signpost of his surreptitious whereabout every night. Boyer is quite extraordinary in expressing venom under his high-and-mighty politeness, frowning and pouting, his devilish complexion enlivens the film's watchability even at its corniest part, a bestial man indeed, but a tour-de-force exemplar of his kind. Bergman, although is the hapless victim who is unwittingly sleeping with the enemy, very anti-femme- fatale indeed, manages to deliver a visceral transition of Paula's trauma, which certainly out of her usual graceful and elegant comfort zone, and albeit her Nordic height, it is such a stretch for her to reveal her female vulnerability without any reservation. She got her first Oscar for the film, I'm now wavering in choosing my pick between her and Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's noir paradigm DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10). A third-billed Joseph Cotten is the cardboard detective eventually will be the hero, and Dame May Witty, the garrulous busybody, appears sporadically in case she overstays her welcome. The film is also Angela Lansbury's film debut, at the age of 17 during the shoot, the young flighty maid might only be a pawn in the plot, but a rather singular boldness and an Oscar nomination presages her reverend orbit as one of the most versatile character-actress in the Hollywood history. Overall, the film is a highly-recommendable piece of psychological study, shot in minimal bleakness (even the gala concert is intentionally shortened) with solemn and choppy original score from Bronislau Kaper. From a modern-day POV, one might find Paula is a stereotyped exploitation about how women usually are portrayed in the yesteryear, which seems out of topicality now (not domestic violence, just the showcase of female's utter dependence and extreme delicacy), so, it might undermine the reception from the younger generation, but anyway, at least, a big bravo to Bergman and Boyer.

    In London, beautiful young Ingrid Bergman (as Paula Alquist) is taken away from 9 Thornton Square after the strangulation of her guardian aunt, a renowned opera singer. The murder is unsolved and a fortune in jewels disappears. Years later, Ms. Bergman takes singing lessons in Italy, hoping to follow in her aunt's footsteps. She falls in love with older French pianist Charles Boyer (as Gregory Anton). The newlyweds move to Bergman's inherited home in Thornton Square, site of the earlier tragedy. Lower class Angela Lansbury (as Nancy) and Barbara Everest (as Elizabeth) are hired as housekeeper and cook... The dimming of "Gaslight" and other mysteries ensue... Scotland Yard investigator Joseph Cotten (as Brian Cameron) is suspicious and elderly neighbor May Witty (as Miss Thwaites) is nosy. This is a re-make of the superior British "Gaslight" (1940). Although the leads often seem overly posed (it is, after all, seen through the productive lenses at MGM), all perform exceptionally for director George Cukor. Everything looks exquisite as photographed in black-and white by Joseph Ruttenberg. Bergman won a "Best Actress" Oscar for her high strung portrayal and Ms. Lansbury got a nomination in her first screen credit. ******** Gaslight (5/4/44) George Cukor ~ Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten, Angela Lansbury

    A Unique Movie In Western Cinematography

    The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian! The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense. If on the ruins of our world, aliens from another planet were to some day enquire about the most representative Western movie ever made - it would be "Gaslight" (1944).

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman moves back into the house with her new husband. However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. If you ask me, this movie is great! Gaslight is a remarkable movie, it's a remarkable movie indeed! I watched this movie yesterday at it's a masterpiece that is directed by another one of the greatest directors of all time, George Cukor, the director of movies like My Fair Lady and The Philadelphia Story. Ingrid Bergman who appeared in Casablanca won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in this movie, as she was absolutely outstanding! We also have a great performance from Charles Boyer, who is trying to prove to Ingrid Bergman's character that she is absolutely mad. And George Cukor's directing is superb, as it usually is! Cukor was a genius, he was an absolute genius. This movie gets a ten out of ten from me, it's a marvelous movie directed by a great director and has a great cast too! In addition to the great acting and directing, the cinematography is stunning. As with most black and white movies, the cinematography adds a dark dramatic appearance to a movie, and in some cases, it even makes the movie a little bit eerie and creepy! But you want to know something? That's just the way that I like it, I love black and white cinematography, I love the dark appearances of the movies! Getting back to Gaslight, I can't think of one negative thing to say about it, as the acting, the cinematography, the directing, or in short, everything is so great, that it is impossible to think of anything that is not to like about the movie. I'll definitely add this movie to my list of great movies, as it is another movie that came out during the golden age of film. Nowadays, with only a few exceptions, they don't seem to make movies that way they used to make them, if they did, then maybe the film industry would be much more prosperous. So all in all, Gaslight is another movie that I can say is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I have heard nothing but great things about it, and all of these great things are absolutely true, as this movie really is a great movie! Gaslight is another movie that you must watch whenever you have the time to do so, as you will say that this movie is a great movie that you will not regret watching! Bravo to George Cukor, Charles Boyer, and especially to Ingrid Bergman for working together to film such a great movie! By the way, something I forget to mention, there are a few scenes in this movie that may leave you wanting to question your own sanity, and I really love a movie like that! In short, Gaslight is a movie that you should definitely watch if you haven't done so already, as it is an absolutely superb movie that exceeds on just about every single level that there is! 10/10

    I knew this film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but it was only after watching it I found out that the leading actress won the Oscar, so I was satisfied twice, from director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, Born Yesterday, A Star Is Born, My Fair Lady). Basically famous opera singer Alice Alquist has been murdered, and the perpetrator escaped without the hidden jewels he wanted, because young niece Paula (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ingrid Bergman) watched him commit the crime, she was being cared for following her mother's death. She travels to Italy to try and escape the memory of that terrible night at Number 9 Thornton Square in London, and she trains to become an opera star, and while doing this she meets and falls in love with Gregory Anton (Oscar nominated Charles Boyer). They eventually get married, and he convinces her that she should return home to London and to the house where the horrific incident happened, as it was bequeathed to her, and so that she can calm her anxieties, and all her aunt's possessions will be stashed in the attic. Moving into the house Paula comes across a letter addressed to her aunt, written two days before her murder from someone named Sergius Bauer, Gregory snatches this in a sudden violent way, but he calms and explains that he is only concerned about her. As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical. The young maid Nancy Oliver (Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury) is causing some stirring in the household as well, but there may be help in the form of undercover Scotland Yard Inspector Brian Cameron (The Third Man's Joseph Cotten) who is trying to get to the bottom of the murder, and the location of the missing jewels. He eventually gets close to Paula and convinces her that she may not be going mad after all, and she finds the letter that Gregory had taken from her, it turns out that Gregory is actually Sergius Bauer, he has been searching the attic for the jewels, and he murdered her aunt. The end sees Gregory finally caught for the murder he committed and attempting to steal the jewels that he did manage to find, and with him tied up Paula gets her own back by psychologically torturing him like he did to her. Also starring Barbara Everest as Elizabeth Tompkins, Eustace Wyatt as Budge, Emil Rameau as Maestro Guardi, Edmund Breon as General Huddleston, Halliwell Hobbes as Mr. Muffin, Tom Stevenson as Williams, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Lawrence Grossmith as Lord Dalroy and Jakob Gimpel as Pianist. Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Ingrid Bergman was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!

    a thief, a innocent young woman, a hero. and strange psychological war. a noir but, more that, perfect show of two great actors. because all is in right place, tension as result of details, music, atmosphere, circle of terror and ambiguous pieces of reality. the rules of seduction and the web of spider. the fragility of Ingrid Bergman is part of subtle game of illusion and suffering. Charles Boyer - like insidious snake - creates one of his most precise characters. Angela Lansburry - in one of her roles - is a good surprise. in this conditions, it is more than a good movie. it is example of perfect use of ordinaries ingredients and, in same time, slice of refined art.

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman (Ingrid Bergman) moves back into the house with her new husband (Charles Boyer). However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. I think this is a very different kind of mystery. It involves a murder, but there is never really any doubt about the killer. And it involves a wife thinking she is going crazy, yet we know all along that she is not. (In fact, despite the praise she has received, I think Bergman overdid it a little bit on her acting here... I found it hard to believe that she was that stupid.) Placing the film in the same era as the Jack the Ripper murders was a nice touch, as it could just have easily been the 1940s and the plot would not have been substantially altered. And the debut of Angela Lansbury? Truly remarkable. Who knew she had such a cockney accent inside her? Great film... a very solid performance from very solid talents. George Cukor never fails to succeed.

    To prevent Blacklisting, possibly a spoiler comment. If you are still reading, I watched this film because I am writing a book on Narcissism. Although it is not mentioned in the film description many feel this is where the Narcissistic term, "Gaslighting" comes from. As the film is unfolding and we see the Psychological torture Paula is undergoing through the hands of her husband Gregory, we are left to ponder, why would someone that loves you do this to you on purpose? It is a toxic environment that would slowly drive anyone mad. The wife, Paula, feels as though it is not real or she is somehow imagining it. Unless you have lived through this yourself, I unfortunately have, it is hard to wrap yourself around how torturous this feeling is. It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...

    Great Film in Many Ways, Though Bergman is Uncharacteristically Hammy

    Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, GASLIGHT was made in Great Britain four years previous to this version. Louis B Mayer was so taken with the play that he bought not only the film rights but also the distribution rights to the 1940 film, after which he locked it in the MGM vault so that it was not seen in the States for decades. It is interesting to compare the two versions: most critics seem to place the British original in higher esteem, but I disagree, mainly due to the performances of the two lead actors. Diana Wynyard, an old-style actress in the British tradition, gives a good but rather uninteresting performance; she spends most of the film in a state of near-catatonia which, frankly, gets old fast, while her co-star Anton Walbrook overacts shamelessly all over the place, which has the unfortunate effect of robbing the piece of much of its suspense. George Cukor, known as one of the best directors of actors of his day, makes a vast improvement in the acting in the 1944 version, though he may have gone slightly overboard in the case of Ingrid Bergman. She won her first Oscar for her performance in this film, but it is not her best work: an uneven performance that in spots is a tad bit hammy, something that Bergman practically NEVER did; she was a master at underplaying (see CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS). She's good in GASLIGHT, but as I have already stated in my review of that film, the actress who should have won the Award for 1944 should have been Barbara Stanwyck for her seminal performance as the ultimate femme fatale in Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Ironically, it isn't really Bergman who gives the best lead performance here: it's Boyer. Aside from a certain "sourpuss" expression on his face, at the beginning we have no idea what a monster this man is, nor do we have a clue as to what he is planning to do to his adoring young bride. As a result Cukor manages to drag out the suspense in an almost Hitchcock-like fashion until it becomes nearly unbearable. Boyer's Gregory Anton is one of the great screen villains; wearing the mask of a loving husband, he proceeds to drive his wife to the brink of madness in such an effective manner that the term "gaslighting" actually entered the vernacular, as in "He's gaslighting us (meaning "he's lying/misleading/playing us")." To relieve some of the darkness of the main plot, Cukor provides two comic relief characters: local busybody Miss Thwaites, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Dame May Witty, and housemaid Nancy, a saucy little tart who flirts openly with Gregory while at the same time not bothering to conceal her disdain for his wife. Angela Lansbury, all of eighteen years old and making her film debut, sank her teeth into the role of the trampy little bitch and got an Oscar nomination right out of the box for it. It is one of the most auspicious debuts of one of the greatest actresses Hollywood, Broadway, and television have ever been graced with. Also on hand to solve the mystery is Brian Cameron (the great Joseph Cotten in yet another of his fine performances), a Scotland Yard detective who as a young boy idolized Paula's aunt, a famous opera star who was brutally murdered when the girl was in her teens. All of this sounds like I am knocking Bergman, but I really don't mean to. She is one of my favorite actresses of all time, and her performance here is excellent; I am just not sure if it is Oscar-worthy. At any rate I still think Stanwyck should have won. And Bergman gave Oscar performances in many other films for which she was not always recognized with so much as a nomination: NOTORIOUS, CASABLANCA, and THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS come to mind, to mention only a few. At any rate, any film effective enough that its title becomes part of the language is obviously operating on a higher level than most films, Oscar or no Oscar.

Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to. While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior.

    In London, beautiful young Ingrid Bergman (as Paula Alquist) is taken away from 9 Thornton Square after the strangulation of her guardian aunt, a renowned opera singer. The murder is unsolved and a fortune in jewels disappears. Years later, Ms. Bergman takes singing lessons in Italy, hoping to follow in her aunt's footsteps. She falls in love with older French pianist Charles Boyer (as Gregory Anton). The newlyweds move to Bergman's inherited home in Thornton Square, site of the earlier tragedy. Lower class Angela Lansbury (as Nancy) and Barbara Everest (as Elizabeth) are hired as housekeeper and cook... The dimming of "Gaslight" and other mysteries ensue... Scotland Yard investigator Joseph Cotten (as Brian Cameron) is suspicious and elderly neighbor May Witty (as Miss Thwaites) is nosy. This is a re-make of the superior British "Gaslight" (1940). Although the leads often seem overly posed (it is, after all, seen through the productive lenses at MGM), all perform exceptionally for director George Cukor. Everything looks exquisite as photographed in black-and white by Joseph Ruttenberg. Bergman won a "Best Actress" Oscar for her high strung portrayal and Ms. Lansbury got a nomination in her first screen credit. ******** Gaslight (5/4/44) George Cukor ~ Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten, Angela Lansbury

    The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian! The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense. If on the ruins of our world, aliens from another planet were to some day enquire about the most representative Western movie ever made - it would be "Gaslight" (1944).

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman moves back into the house with her new husband. However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. If you ask me, this movie is great! Gaslight is a remarkable movie, it's a remarkable movie indeed! I watched this movie yesterday at it's a masterpiece that is directed by another one of the greatest directors of all time, George Cukor, the director of movies like My Fair Lady and The Philadelphia Story. Ingrid Bergman who appeared in Casablanca won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in this movie, as she was absolutely outstanding! We also have a great performance from Charles Boyer, who is trying to prove to Ingrid Bergman's character that she is absolutely mad. And George Cukor's directing is superb, as it usually is! Cukor was a genius, he was an absolute genius. This movie gets a ten out of ten from me, it's a marvelous movie directed by a great director and has a great cast too! In addition to the great acting and directing, the cinematography is stunning. As with most black and white movies, the cinematography adds a dark dramatic appearance to a movie, and in some cases, it even makes the movie a little bit eerie and creepy! But you want to know something? That's just the way that I like it, I love black and white cinematography, I love the dark appearances of the movies! Getting back to Gaslight, I can't think of one negative thing to say about it, as the acting, the cinematography, the directing, or in short, everything is so great, that it is impossible to think of anything that is not to like about the movie. I'll definitely add this movie to my list of great movies, as it is another movie that came out during the golden age of film. Nowadays, with only a few exceptions, they don't seem to make movies that way they used to make them, if they did, then maybe the film industry would be much more prosperous. So all in all, Gaslight is another movie that I can say is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I have heard nothing but great things about it, and all of these great things are absolutely true, as this movie really is a great movie! Gaslight is another movie that you must watch whenever you have the time to do so, as you will say that this movie is a great movie that you will not regret watching! Bravo to George Cukor, Charles Boyer, and especially to Ingrid Bergman for working together to film such a great movie! By the way, something I forget to mention, there are a few scenes in this movie that may leave you wanting to question your own sanity, and I really love a movie like that! In short, Gaslight is a movie that you should definitely watch if you haven't done so already, as it is an absolutely superb movie that exceeds on just about every single level that there is! 10/10

    I knew this film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but it was only after watching it I found out that the leading actress won the Oscar, so I was satisfied twice, from director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, Born Yesterday, A Star Is Born, My Fair Lady). Basically famous opera singer Alice Alquist has been murdered, and the perpetrator escaped without the hidden jewels he wanted, because young niece Paula (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ingrid Bergman) watched him commit the crime, she was being cared for following her mother's death. She travels to Italy to try and escape the memory of that terrible night at Number 9 Thornton Square in London, and she trains to become an opera star, and while doing this she meets and falls in love with Gregory Anton (Oscar nominated Charles Boyer). They eventually get married, and he convinces her that she should return home to London and to the house where the horrific incident happened, as it was bequeathed to her, and so that she can calm her anxieties, and all her aunt's possessions will be stashed in the attic. Moving into the house Paula comes across a letter addressed to her aunt, written two days before her murder from someone named Sergius Bauer, Gregory snatches this in a sudden violent way, but he calms and explains that he is only concerned about her. As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical. The young maid Nancy Oliver (Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury) is causing some stirring in the household as well, but there may be help in the form of undercover Scotland Yard Inspector Brian Cameron (The Third Man's Joseph Cotten) who is trying to get to the bottom of the murder, and the location of the missing jewels. He eventually gets close to Paula and convinces her that she may not be going mad after all, and she finds the letter that Gregory had taken from her, it turns out that Gregory is actually Sergius Bauer, he has been searching the attic for the jewels, and he murdered her aunt. The end sees Gregory finally caught for the murder he committed and attempting to steal the jewels that he did manage to find, and with him tied up Paula gets her own back by psychologically torturing him like he did to her. Also starring Barbara Everest as Elizabeth Tompkins, Eustace Wyatt as Budge, Emil Rameau as Maestro Guardi, Edmund Breon as General Huddleston, Halliwell Hobbes as Mr. Muffin, Tom Stevenson as Williams, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Lawrence Grossmith as Lord Dalroy and Jakob Gimpel as Pianist. Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Ingrid Bergman was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!

    a thief, a innocent young woman, a hero. and strange psychological war. a noir but, more that, perfect show of two great actors. because all is in right place, tension as result of details, music, atmosphere, circle of terror and ambiguous pieces of reality. the rules of seduction and the web of spider. the fragility of Ingrid Bergman is part of subtle game of illusion and suffering. Charles Boyer - like insidious snake - creates one of his most precise characters. Angela Lansburry - in one of her roles - is a good surprise. in this conditions, it is more than a good movie. it is example of perfect use of ordinaries ingredients and, in same time, slice of refined art.

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman (Ingrid Bergman) moves back into the house with her new husband (Charles Boyer). However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. I think this is a very different kind of mystery. It involves a murder, but there is never really any doubt about the killer. And it involves a wife thinking she is going crazy, yet we know all along that she is not. (In fact, despite the praise she has received, I think Bergman overdid it a little bit on her acting here... I found it hard to believe that she was that stupid.) Placing the film in the same era as the Jack the Ripper murders was a nice touch, as it could just have easily been the 1940s and the plot would not have been substantially altered. And the debut of Angela Lansbury? Truly remarkable. Who knew she had such a cockney accent inside her? Great film... a very solid performance from very solid talents. George Cukor never fails to succeed.

    To prevent Blacklisting, possibly a spoiler comment. If you are still reading, I watched this film because I am writing a book on Narcissism. Although it is not mentioned in the film description many feel this is where the Narcissistic term, "Gaslighting" comes from. As the film is unfolding and we see the Psychological torture Paula is undergoing through the hands of her husband Gregory, we are left to ponder, why would someone that loves you do this to you on purpose? It is a toxic environment that would slowly drive anyone mad. The wife, Paula, feels as though it is not real or she is somehow imagining it. Unless you have lived through this yourself, I unfortunately have, it is hard to wrap yourself around how torturous this feeling is. It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...

    Great Film in Many Ways, Though Bergman is Uncharacteristically Hammy

    Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, GASLIGHT was made in Great Britain four years previous to this version. Louis B Mayer was so taken with the play that he bought not only the film rights but also the distribution rights to the 1940 film, after which he locked it in the MGM vault so that it was not seen in the States for decades. It is interesting to compare the two versions: most critics seem to place the British original in higher esteem, but I disagree, mainly due to the performances of the two lead actors. Diana Wynyard, an old-style actress in the British tradition, gives a good but rather uninteresting performance; she spends most of the film in a state of near-catatonia which, frankly, gets old fast, while her co-star Anton Walbrook overacts shamelessly all over the place, which has the unfortunate effect of robbing the piece of much of its suspense. George Cukor, known as one of the best directors of actors of his day, makes a vast improvement in the acting in the 1944 version, though he may have gone slightly overboard in the case of Ingrid Bergman. She won her first Oscar for her performance in this film, but it is not her best work: an uneven performance that in spots is a tad bit hammy, something that Bergman practically NEVER did; she was a master at underplaying (see CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS). She's good in GASLIGHT, but as I have already stated in my review of that film, the actress who should have won the Award for 1944 should have been Barbara Stanwyck for her seminal performance as the ultimate femme fatale in Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Ironically, it isn't really Bergman who gives the best lead performance here: it's Boyer. Aside from a certain "sourpuss" expression on his face, at the beginning we have no idea what a monster this man is, nor do we have a clue as to what he is planning to do to his adoring young bride. As a result Cukor manages to drag out the suspense in an almost Hitchcock-like fashion until it becomes nearly unbearable. Boyer's Gregory Anton is one of the great screen villains; wearing the mask of a loving husband, he proceeds to drive his wife to the brink of madness in such an effective manner that the term "gaslighting" actually entered the vernacular, as in "He's gaslighting us (meaning "he's lying/misleading/playing us")." To relieve some of the darkness of the main plot, Cukor provides two comic relief characters: local busybody Miss Thwaites, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Dame May Witty, and housemaid Nancy, a saucy little tart who flirts openly with Gregory while at the same time not bothering to conceal her disdain for his wife. Angela Lansbury, all of eighteen years old and making her film debut, sank her teeth into the role of the trampy little bitch and got an Oscar nomination right out of the box for it. It is one of the most auspicious debuts of one of the greatest actresses Hollywood, Broadway, and television have ever been graced with. Also on hand to solve the mystery is Brian Cameron (the great Joseph Cotten in yet another of his fine performances), a Scotland Yard detective who as a young boy idolized Paula's aunt, a famous opera star who was brutally murdered when the girl was in her teens. All of this sounds like I am knocking Bergman, but I really don't mean to. She is one of my favorite actresses of all time, and her performance here is excellent; I am just not sure if it is Oscar-worthy. At any rate I still think Stanwyck should have won. And Bergman gave Oscar performances in many other films for which she was not always recognized with so much as a nomination: NOTORIOUS, CASABLANCA, and THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS come to mind, to mention only a few. At any rate, any film effective enough that its title becomes part of the language is obviously operating on a higher level than most films, Oscar or no Oscar.

    American audiences did not get to see the 1940 British version of "Angel Street" for many years after MGM planned its own version with an exciting cast, a famous director and its typical glossy production values. While a viewing of the 1940 version might cause some to put down its American remake, that version does stand out for excellent performances, lavish sets and costumes and lush photography, even if it comes up a bit short in what the 1940 version made up in far more recognizable technical achievements that make that version seem even newer than its remake. Poor Ingrid Bergman has memories of the murder of her aunt in her London home when she was much younger and has avoided stepping into the house for many years. A chance encounter with a newer resident of that street (Dame May Witty) brings back memories, and faster than Dame May can utter "Well!", Bergman is returning home with her new husband (Charles Boyer) who is all charm and culture on the outside but hiding a dangerous secret on the inside. No sooner have they remodeled the old homestead than Bergman seems to undergo some mental anguish. She is forgetful, apparently looses things, has crying spells for no apparent reason, and Boyer tells her he fears she is on the verge of loosing her mind, he claims, exactly like her mother did. A curious young man (Joseph Cotten) takes notice of Bergman and Boyer and ingratiates himself with the nosy neighbor Dame May while Boyer himself seems enamored of the new cockney maid (Angela Lansbury). This is as dark and Gothic as the title says, the "Gaslight" having two meanings: the form of artificial lighting which the pre-excessive electricity day world lived with, and a psychological manipulation of destroying another person by making them doubt their own sanity. Both Bergman and Boyer are outstanding, and she combines both vulnerability and confusion in her character who is certain she is not guilty of the things she has been accused of, even though there is no other explanation for them. Boyer's character switches early on from suave to suddenly sinister, taking away any romantic image you may have of him from such earlier classics as "Conquest" and "Love Affair". Dame May adds obvious comic relief, but her stereotypical nosy neighbor has more to do than just peak through curtains and swipe a strawberry from the deaf cook. As for brand new to the screen Lansbury, you won't soon forget the image of her in her truly trashy get-up, and the way she treats Bergman with such obvious contempt in spite of being employed by her makes her almost a Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") in training. Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to. While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior. As directed by George Cukor, this ends up a triumph that overshadowed the original version simply because MGM's head (Louis B. Mayer) kept the other version hid in preparation for the release of this version which he didn't want overshadowed.

    What an intense drama about psychological abuse, and implants the virulent dual-murders, one from the past and another is ongoing, one is fulfilled and the other is up in the air, George Cukor (from MY FAIR LADY 1964, 6/10; A STAR IS BORN 1954, 8/10 and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY 1940, 8/10) blindsided me with his own creation of film noir, and conducts Boyer and Bergman's career-best performances. An unsolved crime at the beginning, the film drops from a whodunit detective story rather early, after the a short spell of foreign sojourn (Lake Como, where else would be more romantic?), the newly-weds returns to London, for Paula (Bergman), the scar dooms to be lifted open and the bare wound is even more deleterious than she could ever imagine. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's play "ANGEL STREET", the film predominantly is a two-hander between Paula and Gregory (Boyer), and about how Gregory punctiliously and effectively manipulates and impairs Paula's mental state, he ensnares Paulo into a self-doubt of her sanity (the very first outing in London is to visit the torture chamber, no wonder all the Museums of Torture are prevailing in the touristic attractions here in Europe), insulating her from meeting other people, trapped her in the mansion and slowly yet mercilessly infuses all the hallucinogenic chicanery to further damage her flimsy nerve, which includes the titular gaslight and it also serves as a signpost of his surreptitious whereabout every night. Boyer is quite extraordinary in expressing venom under his high-and-mighty politeness, frowning and pouting, his devilish complexion enlivens the film's watchability even at its corniest part, a bestial man indeed, but a tour-de-force exemplar of his kind. Bergman, although is the hapless victim who is unwittingly sleeping with the enemy, very anti-femme- fatale indeed, manages to deliver a visceral transition of Paula's trauma, which certainly out of her usual graceful and elegant comfort zone, and albeit her Nordic height, it is such a stretch for her to reveal her female vulnerability without any reservation. She got her first Oscar for the film, I'm now wavering in choosing my pick between her and Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's noir paradigm DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10). A third-billed Joseph Cotten is the cardboard detective eventually will be the hero, and Dame May Witty, the garrulous busybody, appears sporadically in case she overstays her welcome. The film is also Angela Lansbury's film debut, at the age of 17 during the shoot, the young flighty maid might only be a pawn in the plot, but a rather singular boldness and an Oscar nomination presages her reverend orbit as one of the most versatile character-actress in the Hollywood history. Overall, the film is a highly-recommendable piece of psychological study, shot in minimal bleakness (even the gala concert is intentionally shortened) with solemn and choppy original score from Bronislau Kaper. From a modern-day POV, one might find Paula is a stereotyped exploitation about how women usually are portrayed in the yesteryear, which seems out of topicality now (not domestic violence, just the showcase of female's utter dependence and extreme delicacy), so, it might undermine the reception from the younger generation, but anyway, at least, a big bravo to Bergman and Boyer.

    The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian! The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense.

    I knew this film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but it was only after watching it I found out that the leading actress won the Oscar, so I was satisfied twice, from director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, Born Yesterday, A Star Is Born, My Fair Lady). Basically famous opera singer Alice Alquist has been murdered, and the perpetrator escaped without the hidden jewels he wanted, because young niece Paula (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ingrid Bergman) watched him commit the crime, she was being cared for following her mother's death. She travels to Italy to try and escape the memory of that terrible night at Number 9 Thornton Square in London, and she trains to become an opera star, and while doing this she meets and falls in love with Gregory Anton (Oscar nominated Charles Boyer). They eventually get married, and he convinces her that she should return home to London and to the house where the horrific incident happened, as it was bequeathed to her, and so that she can calm her anxieties, and all her aunt's possessions will be stashed in the attic. Moving into the house Paula comes across a letter addressed to her aunt, written two days before her murder from someone named Sergius Bauer, Gregory snatches this in a sudden violent way, but he calms and explains that he is only concerned about her. As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical. The young maid Nancy Oliver (Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury) is causing some stirring in the household as well, but there may be help in the form of undercover Scotland Yard Inspector Brian Cameron (The Third Man's Joseph Cotten) who is trying to get to the bottom of the murder, and the location of the missing jewels. He eventually gets close to Paula and convinces her that she may not be going mad after all, and she finds the letter that Gregory had taken from her, it turns out that Gregory is actually Sergius Bauer, he has been searching the attic for the jewels, and he murdered her aunt. The end sees Gregory finally caught for the murder he committed and attempting to steal the jewels that he did manage to find, and with him tied up Paula gets her own back by psychologically torturing him like he did to her. Also starring Barbara Everest as Elizabeth Tompkins, Eustace Wyatt as Budge, Emil Rameau as Maestro Guardi, Edmund Breon as General Huddleston, Halliwell Hobbes as Mr. Muffin, Tom Stevenson as Williams, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Lawrence Grossmith as Lord Dalroy and Jakob Gimpel as Pianist. Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Ingrid Bergman was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman (Ingrid Bergman) moves back into the house with her new husband (Charles Boyer). However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. I think this is a very different kind of mystery. It involves a murder, but there is never really any doubt about the killer. And it involves a wife thinking she is going crazy, yet we know all along that she is not. (In fact, despite the praise she has received, I think Bergman overdid it a little bit on her acting here... I found it hard to believe that she was that stupid.) Placing the film in the same era as the Jack the Ripper murders was a nice touch, as it could just have easily been the 1940s and the plot would not have been substantially altered. And the debut of Angela Lansbury? Truly remarkable. Who knew she had such a cockney accent inside her? Great film... a very solid performance from very solid talents. George Cukor never fails to succeed.

    To prevent Blacklisting, possibly a spoiler comment. If you are still reading, I watched this film because I am writing a book on Narcissism. Although it is not mentioned in the film description many feel this is where the Narcissistic term, "Gaslighting" comes from. As the film is unfolding and we see the Psychological torture Paula is undergoing through the hands of her husband Gregory, we are left to ponder, why would someone that loves you do this to you on purpose? It is a toxic environment that would slowly drive anyone mad. The wife, Paula, feels as though it is not real or she is somehow imagining it. Unless you have lived through this yourself, I unfortunately have, it is hard to wrap yourself around how torturous this feeling is. It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...

    Great Film in Many Ways, Though Bergman is Uncharacteristically Hammy

    Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, GASLIGHT was made in Great Britain four years previous to this version. Louis B Mayer was so taken with the play that he bought not only the film rights but also the distribution rights to the 1940 film, after which he locked it in the MGM vault so that it was not seen in the States for decades. It is interesting to compare the two versions: most critics seem to place the British original in higher esteem, but I disagree, mainly due to the performances of the two lead actors. Diana Wynyard, an old-style actress in the British tradition, gives a good but rather uninteresting performance; she spends most of the film in a state of near-catatonia which, frankly, gets old fast, while her co-star Anton Walbrook overacts shamelessly all over the place, which has the unfortunate effect of robbing the piece of much of its suspense. George Cukor, known as one of the best directors of actors of his day, makes a vast improvement in the acting in the 1944 version, though he may have gone slightly overboard in the case of Ingrid Bergman. She won her first Oscar for her performance in this film, but it is not her best work: an uneven performance that in spots is a tad bit hammy, something that Bergman practically NEVER did; she was a master at underplaying (see CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS). She's good in GASLIGHT, but as I have already stated in my review of that film, the actress who should have won the Award for 1944 should have been Barbara Stanwyck for her seminal performance as the ultimate femme fatale in Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Ironically, it isn't really Bergman who gives the best lead performance here: it's Boyer. Aside from a certain "sourpuss" expression on his face, at the beginning we have no idea what a monster this man is, nor do we have a clue as to what he is planning to do to his adoring young bride. As a result Cukor manages to drag out the suspense in an almost Hitchcock-like fashion until it becomes nearly unbearable. Boyer's Gregory Anton is one of the great screen villains; wearing the mask of a loving husband, he proceeds to drive his wife to the brink of madness in such an effective manner that the term "gaslighting" actually entered the vernacular, as in "He's gaslighting us (meaning "he's lying/misleading/playing us")." To relieve some of the darkness of the main plot, Cukor provides two comic relief characters: local busybody Miss Thwaites, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Dame May Witty, and housemaid Nancy, a saucy little tart who flirts openly with Gregory while at the same time not bothering to conceal her disdain for his wife. Angela Lansbury, all of eighteen years old and making her film debut, sank her teeth into the role of the trampy little bitch and got an Oscar nomination right out of the box for it. It is one of the most auspicious debuts of one of the greatest actresses Hollywood, Broadway, and television have ever been graced with. Also on hand to solve the mystery is Brian Cameron (the great Joseph Cotten in yet another of his fine performances), a Scotland Yard detective who as a young boy idolized Paula's aunt, a famous opera star who was brutally murdered when the girl was in her teens. All of this sounds like I am knocking Bergman, but I really don't mean to. She is one of my favorite actresses of all time, and her performance here is excellent; I am just not sure if it is Oscar-worthy. At any rate I still think Stanwyck should have won. And Bergman gave Oscar performances in many other films for which she was not always recognized with so much as a nomination: NOTORIOUS, CASABLANCA, and THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS come to mind, to mention only a few. At any rate, any film effective enough that its title becomes part of the language is obviously operating on a higher level than most films, Oscar or no Oscar.

    American audiences did not get to see the 1940 British version of "Angel Street" for many years after MGM planned its own version with an exciting cast, a famous director and its typical glossy production values. While a viewing of the 1940 version might cause some to put down its American remake, that version does stand out for excellent performances, lavish sets and costumes and lush photography, even if it comes up a bit short in what the 1940 version made up in far more recognizable technical achievements that make that version seem even newer than its remake. Poor Ingrid Bergman has memories of the murder of her aunt in her London home when she was much younger and has avoided stepping into the house for many years. A chance encounter with a newer resident of that street (Dame May Witty) brings back memories, and faster than Dame May can utter "Well!", Bergman is returning home with her new husband (Charles Boyer) who is all charm and culture on the outside but hiding a dangerous secret on the inside. No sooner have they remodeled the old homestead than Bergman seems to undergo some mental anguish. She is forgetful, apparently looses things, has crying spells for no apparent reason, and Boyer tells her he fears she is on the verge of loosing her mind, he claims, exactly like her mother did. A curious young man (Joseph Cotten) takes notice of Bergman and Boyer and ingratiates himself with the nosy neighbor Dame May while Boyer himself seems enamored of the new cockney maid (Angela Lansbury). This is as dark and Gothic as the title says, the "Gaslight" having two meanings: the form of artificial lighting which the pre-excessive electricity day world lived with, and a psychological manipulation of destroying another person by making them doubt their own sanity. Both Bergman and Boyer are outstanding, and she combines both vulnerability and confusion in her character who is certain she is not guilty of the things she has been accused of, even though there is no other explanation for them. Boyer's character switches early on from suave to suddenly sinister, taking away any romantic image you may have of him from such earlier classics as "Conquest" and "Love Affair". Dame May adds obvious comic relief, but her stereotypical nosy neighbor has more to do than just peak through curtains and swipe a strawberry from the deaf cook. As for brand new to the screen Lansbury, you won't soon forget the image of her in her truly trashy get-up, and the way she treats Bergman with such obvious contempt in spite of being employed by her makes her almost a Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") in training. Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to. While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior. As directed by George Cukor, this ends up a triumph that overshadowed the original version simply because MGM's head (Louis B. Mayer) kept the other version hid in preparation for the release of this version which he didn't want overshadowed.

    What an intense drama about psychological abuse, and implants the virulent dual-murders, one from the past and another is ongoing, one is fulfilled and the other is up in the air, George Cukor (from MY FAIR LADY 1964, 6/10; A STAR IS BORN 1954, 8/10 and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY 1940, 8/10) blindsided me with his own creation of film noir, and conducts Boyer and Bergman's career-best performances. An unsolved crime at the beginning, the film drops from a whodunit detective story rather early, after the a short spell of foreign sojourn (Lake Como, where else would be more romantic?), the newly-weds returns to London, for Paula (Bergman), the scar dooms to be lifted open and the bare wound is even more deleterious than she could ever imagine. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's play "ANGEL STREET", the film predominantly is a two-hander between Paula and Gregory (Boyer), and about how Gregory punctiliously and effectively manipulates and impairs Paula's mental state, he ensnares Paulo into a self-doubt of her sanity (the very first outing in London is to visit the torture chamber, no wonder all the Museums of Torture are prevailing in the touristic attractions here in Europe), insulating her from meeting other people, trapped her in the mansion and slowly yet mercilessly infuses all the hallucinogenic chicanery to further damage her flimsy nerve, which includes the titular gaslight and it also serves as a signpost of his surreptitious whereabout every night. Boyer is quite extraordinary in expressing venom under his high-and-mighty politeness, frowning and pouting, his devilish complexion enlivens the film's watchability even at its corniest part, a bestial man indeed, but a tour-de-force exemplar of his kind. Bergman, although is the hapless victim who is unwittingly sleeping with the enemy, very anti-femme- fatale indeed, manages to deliver a visceral transition of Paula's trauma, which certainly out of her usual graceful and elegant comfort zone, and albeit her Nordic height, it is such a stretch for her to reveal her female vulnerability without any reservation. She got her first Oscar for the film, I'm now wavering in choosing my pick between her and Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's noir paradigm DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10). A third-billed Joseph Cotten is the cardboard detective eventually will be the hero, and Dame May Witty, the garrulous busybody, appears sporadically in case she overstays her welcome. The film is also Angela Lansbury's film debut, at the age of 17 during the shoot, the young flighty maid might only be a pawn in the plot, but a rather singular boldness and an Oscar nomination presages her reverend orbit as one of the most versatile character-actress in the Hollywood history. Overall, the film is a highly-recommendable piece of psychological study, shot in minimal bleakness (even the gala concert is intentionally shortened) with solemn and choppy original score from Bronislau Kaper. From a modern-day POV, one might find Paula is a stereotyped exploitation about how women usually are portrayed in the yesteryear, which seems out of topicality now (not domestic violence, just the showcase of female's utter dependence and extreme delicacy), so, it might undermine the reception from the younger generation, but anyway, at least, a big bravo to Bergman and Boyer.

    In London, beautiful young Ingrid Bergman (as Paula Alquist) is taken away from 9 Thornton Square after the strangulation of her guardian aunt, a renowned opera singer. The murder is unsolved and a fortune in jewels disappears. Years later, Ms. Bergman takes singing lessons in Italy, hoping to follow in her aunt's footsteps. She falls in love with older French pianist Charles Boyer (as Gregory Anton). The newlyweds move to Bergman's inherited home in Thornton Square, site of the earlier tragedy. Lower class Angela Lansbury (as Nancy) and Barbara Everest (as Elizabeth) are hired as housekeeper and cook... The dimming of "Gaslight" and other mysteries ensue... Scotland Yard investigator Joseph Cotten (as Brian Cameron) is suspicious and elderly neighbor May Witty (as Miss Thwaites) is nosy. This is a re-make of the superior British "Gaslight" (1940). Although the leads often seem overly posed (it is, after all, seen through the productive lenses at MGM), all perform exceptionally for director George Cukor. Everything looks exquisite as photographed in black-and white by Joseph Ruttenberg. Bergman won a "Best Actress" Oscar for her high strung portrayal and Ms. Lansbury got a nomination in her first screen credit. ******** Gaslight (5/4/44) George Cukor ~ Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten, Angela Lansbury

    The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian! The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense. If on the ruins of our world, aliens from another planet were to some day enquire about the most representative Western movie ever made - it would be "Gaslight" (1944).

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman moves back into the house with her new husband. However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. If you ask me, this movie is great! Gaslight is a remarkable movie, it's a remarkable movie indeed! I watched this movie yesterday at it's a masterpiece that is directed by another one of the greatest directors of all time, George Cukor, the director of movies like My Fair Lady and The Philadelphia Story. Ingrid Bergman who appeared in Casablanca won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in this movie, as she was absolutely outstanding! We also have a great performance from Charles Boyer, who is trying to prove to Ingrid Bergman's character that she is absolutely mad. And George Cukor's directing is superb, as it usually is! Cukor was a genius, he was an absolute genius. This movie gets a ten out of ten from me, it's a marvelous movie directed by a great director and has a great cast too! In addition to the great acting and directing, the cinematography is stunning. As with most black and white movies, the cinematography adds a dark dramatic appearance to a movie, and in some cases, it even makes the movie a little bit eerie and creepy! But you want to know something? That's just the way that I like it, I love black and white cinematography, I love the dark appearances of the movies! Getting back to Gaslight, I can't think of one negative thing to say about it, as the acting, the cinematography, the directing, or in short, everything is so great, that it is impossible to think of anything that is not to like about the movie. I'll definitely add this movie to my list of great movies, as it is another movie that came out during the golden age of film. Nowadays, with only a few exceptions, they don't seem to make movies that way they used to make them, if they did, then maybe the film industry would be much more prosperous. So all in all, Gaslight is another movie that I can say is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I have heard nothing but great things about it, and all of these great things are absolutely true, as this movie really is a great movie! Gaslight is another movie that you must watch whenever you have the time to do so, as you will say that this movie is a great movie that you will not regret watching! Bravo to George Cukor, Charles Boyer, and especially to Ingrid Bergman for working together to film such a great movie! By the way, something I forget to mention, there are a few scenes in this movie that may leave you wanting to question your own sanity, and I really love a movie like that! In short, Gaslight is a movie that you should definitely watch if you haven't done so already, as it is an absolutely superb movie that exceeds on just about every single level that there is! 10/10

As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical.

Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture.

It is a toxic environment that would slowly drive anyone mad. The wife, Paula, feels as though it is not real or she is somehow imagining it. Unless you have lived through this yourself, I unfortunately have, it is hard to wrap yourself around how torturous this feeling is. It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...

    Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, GASLIGHT was made in Great Britain four years previous to this version. Louis B Mayer was so taken with the play that he bought not only the film rights but also the distribution rights to the 1940 film, after which he locked it in the MGM vault so that it was not seen in the States for decades. It is interesting to compare the two versions: most critics seem to place the British original in higher esteem, but I disagree, mainly due to the performances of the two lead actors. Diana Wynyard, an old-style actress in the British tradition, gives a good but rather uninteresting performance; she spends most of the film in a state of near-catatonia which, frankly, gets old fast, while her co-star Anton Walbrook overacts shamelessly all over the place, which has the unfortunate effect of robbing the piece of much of its suspense. George Cukor, known as one of the best directors of actors of his day, makes a vast improvement in the acting in the 1944 version, though he may have gone slightly overboard in the case of Ingrid Bergman. She won her first Oscar for her performance in this film, but it is not her best work: an uneven performance that in spots is a tad bit hammy, something that Bergman practically NEVER did; she was a master at underplaying (see CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS). She's good in GASLIGHT, but as I have already stated in my review of that film, the actress who should have won the Award for 1944 should have been Barbara Stanwyck for her seminal performance as the ultimate femme fatale in Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Ironically, it isn't really Bergman who gives the best lead performance here: it's Boyer. Aside from a certain "sourpuss" expression on his face, at the beginning we have no idea what a monster this man is, nor do we have a clue as to what he is planning to do to his adoring young bride. As a result Cukor manages to drag out the suspense in an almost Hitchcock-like fashion until it becomes nearly unbearable. Boyer's Gregory Anton is one of the great screen villains; wearing the mask of a loving husband, he proceeds to drive his wife to the brink of madness in such an effective manner that the term "gaslighting" actually entered the vernacular, as in "He's gaslighting us (meaning "he's lying/misleading/playing us")." To relieve some of the darkness of the main plot, Cukor provides two comic relief characters: local busybody Miss Thwaites, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Dame May Witty, and housemaid Nancy, a saucy little tart who flirts openly with Gregory while at the same time not bothering to conceal her disdain for his wife. Angela Lansbury, all of eighteen years old and making her film debut, sank her teeth into the role of the trampy little bitch and got an Oscar nomination right out of the box for it. It is one of the most auspicious debuts of one of the greatest actresses Hollywood, Broadway, and television have ever been graced with. Also on hand to solve the mystery is Brian Cameron (the great Joseph Cotten in yet another of his fine performances), a Scotland Yard detective who as a young boy idolized Paula's aunt, a famous opera star who was brutally murdered when the girl was in her teens. All of this sounds like I am knocking Bergman, but I really don't mean to. She is one of my favorite actresses of all time, and her performance here is excellent; I am just not sure if it is Oscar-worthy. At any rate I still think Stanwyck should have won. And Bergman gave Oscar performances in many other films for which she was not always recognized with so much as a nomination: NOTORIOUS, CASABLANCA, and THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS come to mind, to mention only a few. At any rate, any film effective enough that its title becomes part of the language is obviously operating on a higher level than most films, Oscar or no Oscar.

    American audiences did not get to see the 1940 British version of "Angel Street" for many years after MGM planned its own version with an exciting cast, a famous director and its typical glossy production values. While a viewing of the 1940 version might cause some to put down its American remake, that version does stand out for excellent performances, lavish sets and costumes and lush photography, even if it comes up a bit short in what the 1940 version made up in far more recognizable technical achievements that make that version seem even newer than its remake. Poor Ingrid Bergman has memories of the murder of her aunt in her London home when she was much younger and has avoided stepping into the house for many years. A chance encounter with a newer resident of that street (Dame May Witty) brings back memories, and faster than Dame May can utter "Well!", Bergman is returning home with her new husband (Charles Boyer) who is all charm and culture on the outside but hiding a dangerous secret on the inside. No sooner have they remodeled the old homestead than Bergman seems to undergo some mental anguish. She is forgetful, apparently looses things, has crying spells for no apparent reason, and Boyer tells her he fears she is on the verge of loosing her mind, he claims, exactly like her mother did. A curious young man (Joseph Cotten) takes notice of Bergman and Boyer and ingratiates himself with the nosy neighbor Dame May while Boyer himself seems enamored of the new cockney maid (Angela Lansbury). This is as dark and Gothic as the title says, the "Gaslight" having two meanings: the form of artificial lighting which the pre-excessive electricity day world lived with, and a psychological manipulation of destroying another person by making them doubt their own sanity. Both Bergman and Boyer are outstanding, and she combines both vulnerability and confusion in her character who is certain she is not guilty of the things she has been accused of, even though there is no other explanation for them. Boyer's character switches early on from suave to suddenly sinister, taking away any romantic image you may have of him from such earlier classics as "Conquest" and "Love Affair". Dame May adds obvious comic relief, but her stereotypical nosy neighbor has more to do than just peak through curtains and swipe a strawberry from the deaf cook. As for brand new to the screen Lansbury, you won't soon forget the image of her in her truly trashy get-up, and the way she treats Bergman with such obvious contempt in spite of being employed by her makes her almost a Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") in training. Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to. While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior. As directed by George Cukor, this ends up a triumph that overshadowed the original version simply because MGM's head (Louis B. Mayer) kept the other version hid in preparation for the release of this version which he didn't want overshadowed.

    What an intense drama about psychological abuse, and implants the virulent dual-murders, one from the past and another is ongoing, one is fulfilled and the other is up in the air, George Cukor (from MY FAIR LADY 1964, 6/10; A STAR IS BORN 1954, 8/10 and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY 1940, 8/10) blindsided me with his own creation of film noir, and conducts Boyer and Bergman's career-best performances. An unsolved crime at the beginning, the film drops from a whodunit detective story rather early, after the a short spell of foreign sojourn (Lake Como, where else would be more romantic?), the newly-weds returns to London, for Paula (Bergman), the scar dooms to be lifted open and the bare wound is even more deleterious than she could ever imagine. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's play "ANGEL STREET", the film predominantly is a two-hander between Paula and Gregory (Boyer), and about how Gregory punctiliously and effectively manipulates and impairs Paula's mental state, he ensnares Paulo into a self-doubt of her sanity (the very first outing in London is to visit the torture chamber, no wonder all the Museums of Torture are prevailing in the touristic attractions here in Europe), insulating her from meeting other people, trapped her in the mansion and slowly yet mercilessly infuses all the hallucinogenic chicanery to further damage her flimsy nerve, which includes the titular gaslight and it also serves as a signpost of his surreptitious whereabout every night. Boyer is quite extraordinary in expressing venom under his high-and-mighty politeness, frowning and pouting, his devilish complexion enlivens the film's watchability even at its corniest part, a bestial man indeed, but a tour-de-force exemplar of his kind. Bergman, although is the hapless victim who is unwittingly sleeping with the enemy, very anti-femme- fatale indeed, manages to deliver a visceral transition of Paula's trauma, which certainly out of her usual graceful and elegant comfort zone, and albeit her Nordic height, it is such a stretch for her to reveal her female vulnerability without any reservation. She got her first Oscar for the film, I'm now wavering in choosing my pick between her and Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's noir paradigm DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10). A third-billed Joseph Cotten is the cardboard detective eventually will be the hero, and Dame May Witty, the garrulous busybody, appears sporadically in case she overstays her welcome. The film is also Angela Lansbury's film debut, at the age of 17 during the shoot, the young flighty maid might only be a pawn in the plot, but a rather singular boldness and an Oscar nomination presages her reverend orbit as one of the most versatile character-actress in the Hollywood history. Overall, the film is a highly-recommendable piece of psychological study, shot in minimal bleakness (even the gala concert is intentionally shortened) with solemn and choppy original score from Bronislau Kaper. From a modern-day POV, one might find Paula is a stereotyped exploitation about how women usually are portrayed in the yesteryear, which seems out of topicality now (not domestic violence, just the showcase of female's utter dependence and extreme delicacy), so, it might undermine the reception from the younger generation, but anyway, at least, a big bravo to Bergman and Boyer.

    In London, beautiful young Ingrid Bergman (as Paula Alquist) is taken away from 9 Thornton Square after the strangulation of her guardian aunt, a renowned opera singer. The murder is unsolved and a fortune in jewels disappears. Years later, Ms. Bergman takes singing lessons in Italy, hoping to follow in her aunt's footsteps. She falls in love with older French pianist Charles Boyer (as Gregory Anton). The newlyweds move to Bergman's inherited home in Thornton Square, site of the earlier tragedy. Lower class Angela Lansbury (as Nancy) and Barbara Everest (as Elizabeth) are hired as housekeeper and cook... The dimming of "Gaslight" and other mysteries ensue... Scotland Yard investigator Joseph Cotten (as Brian Cameron) is suspicious and elderly neighbor May Witty (as Miss Thwaites) is nosy. This is a re-make of the superior British "Gaslight" (1940). Although the leads often seem overly posed (it is, after all, seen through the productive lenses at MGM), all perform exceptionally for director George Cukor. Everything looks exquisite as photographed in black-and white by Joseph Ruttenberg. Bergman won a "Best Actress" Oscar for her high strung portrayal and Ms. Lansbury got a nomination in her first screen credit. ******** Gaslight (5/4/44) George Cukor ~ Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten, Angela Lansbury

    The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian! The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense. If on the ruins of our world, aliens from another planet were to some day enquire about the most representative Western movie ever made - it would be "Gaslight" (1944).

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman moves back into the house with her new husband. However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. If you ask me, this movie is great! Gaslight is a remarkable movie, it's a remarkable movie indeed! I watched this movie yesterday at it's a masterpiece that is directed by another one of the greatest directors of all time, George Cukor, the director of movies like My Fair Lady and The Philadelphia Story. Ingrid Bergman who appeared in Casablanca won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in this movie, as she was absolutely outstanding! We also have a great performance from Charles Boyer, who is trying to prove to Ingrid Bergman's character that she is absolutely mad. And George Cukor's directing is superb, as it usually is! Cukor was a genius, he was an absolute genius. This movie gets a ten out of ten from me, it's a marvelous movie directed by a great director and has a great cast too! In addition to the great acting and directing, the cinematography is stunning. As with most black and white movies, the cinematography adds a dark dramatic appearance to a movie, and in some cases, it even makes the movie a little bit eerie and creepy! But you want to know something? That's just the way that I like it, I love black and white cinematography, I love the dark appearances of the movies! Getting back to Gaslight, I can't think of one negative thing to say about it, as the acting, the cinematography, the directing, or in short, everything is so great, that it is impossible to think of anything that is not to like about the movie. I'll definitely add this movie to my list of great movies, as it is another movie that came out during the golden age of film. Nowadays, with only a few exceptions, they don't seem to make movies that way they used to make them, if they did, then maybe the film industry would be much more prosperous. So all in all, Gaslight is another movie that I can say is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I have heard nothing but great things about it, and all of these great things are absolutely true, as this movie really is a great movie! Gaslight is another movie that you must watch whenever you have the time to do so, as you will say that this movie is a great movie that you will not regret watching! Bravo to George Cukor, Charles Boyer, and especially to Ingrid Bergman for working together to film such a great movie! By the way, something I forget to mention, there are a few scenes in this movie that may leave you wanting to question your own sanity, and I really love a movie like that! In short, Gaslight is a movie that you should definitely watch if you haven't done so already, as it is an absolutely superb movie that exceeds on just about every single level that there is! 10/10

    I knew this film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but it was only after watching it I found out that the leading actress won the Oscar, so I was satisfied twice, from director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, Born Yesterday, A Star Is Born, My Fair Lady). Basically famous opera singer Alice Alquist has been murdered, and the perpetrator escaped without the hidden jewels he wanted, because young niece Paula (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ingrid Bergman) watched him commit the crime, she was being cared for following her mother's death. She travels to Italy to try and escape the memory of that terrible night at Number 9 Thornton Square in London, and she trains to become an opera star, and while doing this she meets and falls in love with Gregory Anton (Oscar nominated Charles Boyer). They eventually get married, and he convinces her that she should return home to London and to the house where the horrific incident happened, as it was bequeathed to her, and so that she can calm her anxieties, and all her aunt's possessions will be stashed in the attic. Moving into the house Paula comes across a letter addressed to her aunt, written two days before her murder from someone named Sergius Bauer, Gregory snatches this in a sudden violent way, but he calms and explains that he is only concerned about her. As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical. The young maid Nancy Oliver (Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury) is causing some stirring in the household as well, but there may be help in the form of undercover Scotland Yard Inspector Brian Cameron (The Third Man's Joseph Cotten) who is trying to get to the bottom of the murder, and the location of the missing jewels. He eventually gets close to Paula and convinces her that she may not be going mad after all, and she finds the letter that Gregory had taken from her, it turns out that Gregory is actually Sergius Bauer, he has been searching the attic for the jewels, and he murdered her aunt. The end sees Gregory finally caught for the murder he committed and attempting to steal the jewels that he did manage to find, and with him tied up Paula gets her own back by psychologically torturing him like he did to her. Also starring Barbara Everest as Elizabeth Tompkins, Eustace Wyatt as Budge, Emil Rameau as Maestro Guardi, Edmund Breon as General Huddleston, Halliwell Hobbes as Mr. Muffin, Tom Stevenson as Williams, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Lawrence Grossmith as Lord Dalroy and Jakob Gimpel as Pianist. Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Ingrid Bergman was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!

    a thief, a innocent young woman, a hero. and strange psychological war. a noir but, more that, perfect show of two great actors. because all is in right place, tension as result of details, music, atmosphere, circle of terror and ambiguous pieces of reality. the rules of seduction and the web of spider. the fragility of Ingrid Bergman is part of subtle game of illusion and suffering. Charles Boyer - like insidious snake - creates one of his most precise characters. Angela Lansburry - in one of her roles - is a good surprise. in this conditions, it is more than a good movie. it is example of perfect use of ordinaries ingredients and, in same time, slice of refined art.

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman (Ingrid Bergman) moves back into the house with her new husband (Charles Boyer). However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. I think this is a very different kind of mystery. It involves a murder, but there is never really any doubt about the killer. And it involves a wife thinking she is going crazy, yet we know all along that she is not. (In fact, despite the praise she has received, I think Bergman overdid it a little bit on her acting here... I found it hard to believe that she was that stupid.) Placing the film in the same era as the Jack the Ripper murders was a nice touch, as it could just have easily been the 1940s and the plot would not have been substantially altered. And the debut of Angela Lansbury? Truly remarkable. Who knew she had such a cockney accent inside her? Great film... a very solid performance from very solid talents. George Cukor never fails to succeed.

    To prevent Blacklisting, possibly a spoiler comment. If you are still reading, I watched this film because I am writing a book on Narcissism. Although it is not mentioned in the film description many feel this is where the Narcissistic term, "Gaslighting" comes from. As the film is unfolding and we see the Psychological torture Paula is undergoing through the hands of her husband Gregory, we are left to ponder, why would someone that loves you do this to you on purpose? It is a toxic environment that would slowly drive anyone mad. The wife, Paula, feels as though it is not real or she is somehow imagining it. Unless you have lived through this yourself, I unfortunately have, it is hard to wrap yourself around how torturous this feeling is. It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...

    Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, GASLIGHT was made in Great Britain four years previous to this version. Louis B Mayer was so taken with the play that he bought not only the film rights but also the distribution rights to the 1940 film, after which he locked it in the MGM vault so that it was not seen in the States for decades. It is interesting to compare the two versions: most critics seem to place the British original in higher esteem, but I disagree, mainly due to the performances of the two lead actors. Diana Wynyard, an old-style actress in the British tradition, gives a good but rather uninteresting performance; she spends most of the film in a state of near-catatonia which, frankly, gets old fast, while her co-star Anton Walbrook overacts shamelessly all over the place, which has the unfortunate effect of robbing the piece of much of its suspense. George Cukor, known as one of the best directors of actors of his day, makes a vast improvement in the acting in the 1944 version, though he may have gone slightly overboard in the case of Ingrid Bergman.

A curious young man (Joseph Cotten) takes notice of Bergman and Boyer and ingratiates himself with the nosy neighbor Dame May while Boyer himself seems enamored of the new cockney maid (Angela Lansbury). This is as dark and Gothic as the title says, the "Gaslight" having two meanings: the form of artificial lighting which the pre-excessive electricity day world lived with, and a psychological manipulation of destroying another person by making them doubt their own sanity. Both Bergman and Boyer are outstanding, and she combines both vulnerability and confusion in her character who is certain she is not guilty of the things she has been accused of, even though there is no other explanation for them. Boyer's character switches early on from suave to suddenly sinister, taking away any romantic image you may have of him from such earlier classics as "Conquest" and "Love Affair". Dame May adds obvious comic relief, but her stereotypical nosy neighbor has more to do than just peak through curtains and swipe a strawberry from the deaf cook. As for brand new to the screen Lansbury, you won't soon forget the image of her in her truly trashy get-up, and the way she treats Bergman with such obvious contempt in spite of being employed by her makes her almost a Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") in training. Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to. While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior. As directed by George Cukor, this ends up a triumph that overshadowed the original version simply because MGM's head (Louis B. Mayer) kept the other version hid in preparation for the release of this version which he didn't want overshadowed.

    What an intense drama about psychological abuse, and implants the virulent dual-murders, one from the past and another is ongoing, one is fulfilled and the other is up in the air, George Cukor (from MY FAIR LADY 1964, 6/10; A STAR IS BORN 1954, 8/10 and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY 1940, 8/10) blindsided me with his own creation of film noir, and conducts Boyer and Bergman's career-best performances. An unsolved crime at the beginning, the film drops from a whodunit detective story rather early, after the a short spell of foreign sojourn (Lake Como, where else would be more romantic?), the newly-weds returns to London, for Paula (Bergman), the scar dooms to be lifted open and the bare wound is even more deleterious than she could ever imagine. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's play "ANGEL STREET", the film predominantly is a two-hander between Paula and Gregory (Boyer), and about how Gregory punctiliously and effectively manipulates and impairs Paula's mental state, he ensnares Paulo into a self-doubt of her sanity (the very first outing in London is to visit the torture chamber, no wonder all the Museums of Torture are prevailing in the touristic attractions here in Europe), insulating her from meeting other people, trapped her in the mansion and slowly yet mercilessly infuses all the hallucinogenic chicanery to further damage her flimsy nerve, which includes the titular gaslight and it also serves as a signpost of his surreptitious whereabout every night. Boyer is quite extraordinary in expressing venom under his high-and-mighty politeness, frowning and pouting, his devilish complexion enlivens the film's watchability even at its corniest part, a bestial man indeed, but a tour-de-force exemplar of his kind. Bergman, although is the hapless victim who is unwittingly sleeping with the enemy, very anti-femme- fatale indeed, manages to deliver a visceral transition of Paula's trauma, which certainly out of her usual graceful and elegant comfort zone, and albeit her Nordic height, it is such a stretch for her to reveal her female vulnerability without any reservation. She got her first Oscar for the film, I'm now wavering in choosing my pick between her and Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's noir paradigm DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10). A third-billed Joseph Cotten is the cardboard detective eventually will be the hero, and Dame May Witty, the garrulous busybody, appears sporadically in case she overstays her welcome. The film is also Angela Lansbury's film debut, at the age of 17 during the shoot, the young flighty maid might only be a pawn in the plot, but a rather singular boldness and an Oscar nomination presages her reverend orbit as one of the most versatile character-actress in the Hollywood history. Overall, the film is a highly-recommendable piece of psychological study, shot in minimal bleakness (even the gala concert is intentionally shortened) with solemn and choppy original score from Bronislau Kaper. From a modern-day POV, one might find Paula is a stereotyped exploitation about how women usually are portrayed in the yesteryear, which seems out of topicality now (not domestic violence, just the showcase of female's utter dependence and extreme delicacy), so, it might undermine the reception from the younger generation, but anyway, at least, a big bravo to Bergman and Boyer.

    In London, beautiful young Ingrid Bergman (as Paula Alquist) is taken away from 9 Thornton Square after the strangulation of her guardian aunt, a renowned opera singer. The murder is unsolved and a fortune in jewels disappears. Years later, Ms. Bergman takes singing lessons in Italy, hoping to follow in her aunt's footsteps. She falls in love with older French pianist Charles Boyer (as Gregory Anton). The newlyweds move to Bergman's inherited home in Thornton Square, site of the earlier tragedy. Lower class Angela Lansbury (as Nancy) and Barbara Everest (as Elizabeth) are hired as housekeeper and cook... The dimming of "Gaslight" and other mysteries ensue... Scotland Yard investigator Joseph Cotten (as Brian Cameron) is suspicious and elderly neighbor May Witty (as Miss Thwaites) is nosy. This is a re-make of the superior British "Gaslight" (1940). Although the leads often seem overly posed (it is, after all, seen through the productive lenses at MGM), all perform exceptionally for director George Cukor. Everything looks exquisite as photographed in black-and white by Joseph Ruttenberg. Bergman won a "Best Actress" Oscar for her high strung portrayal and Ms. Lansbury got a nomination in her first screen credit. ******** Gaslight (5/4/44) George Cukor ~ Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten, Angela Lansbury

    The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian! The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense. If on the ruins of our world, aliens from another planet were to some day enquire about the most representative Western movie ever made - it would be "Gaslight" (1944).

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman moves back into the house with her new husband. However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. If you ask me, this movie is great! Gaslight is a remarkable movie, it's a remarkable movie indeed! I watched this movie yesterday at it's a masterpiece that is directed by another one of the greatest directors of all time, George Cukor, the director of movies like My Fair Lady and The Philadelphia Story. Ingrid Bergman who appeared in Casablanca won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in this movie, as she was absolutely outstanding! We also have a great performance from Charles Boyer, who is trying to prove to Ingrid Bergman's character that she is absolutely mad. And George Cukor's directing is superb, as it usually is! Cukor was a genius, he was an absolute genius. This movie gets a ten out of ten from me, it's a marvelous movie directed by a great director and has a great cast too! In addition to the great acting and directing, the cinematography is stunning. As with most black and white movies, the cinematography adds a dark dramatic appearance to a movie, and in some cases, it even makes the movie a little bit eerie and creepy! But you want to know something? That's just the way that I like it, I love black and white cinematography, I love the dark appearances of the movies! Getting back to Gaslight, I can't think of one negative thing to say about it, as the acting, the cinematography, the directing, or in short, everything is so great, that it is impossible to think of anything that is not to like about the movie. I'll definitely add this movie to my list of great movies, as it is another movie that came out during the golden age of film. Nowadays, with only a few exceptions, they don't seem to make movies that way they used to make them, if they did, then maybe the film industry would be much more prosperous. So all in all, Gaslight is another movie that I can say is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I have heard nothing but great things about it, and all of these great things are absolutely true, as this movie really is a great movie! Gaslight is another movie that you must watch whenever you have the time to do so, as you will say that this movie is a great movie that you will not regret watching! Bravo to George Cukor, Charles Boyer, and especially to Ingrid Bergman for working together to film such a great movie! By the way, something I forget to mention, there are a few scenes in this movie that may leave you wanting to question your own sanity, and I really love a movie like that! In short, Gaslight is a movie that you should definitely watch if you haven't done so already, as it is an absolutely superb movie that exceeds on just about every single level that there is! 10/10

    I knew this film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but it was only after watching it I found out that the leading actress won the Oscar, so I was satisfied twice, from director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, Born Yesterday, A Star Is Born, My Fair Lady). Basically famous opera singer Alice Alquist has been murdered, and the perpetrator escaped without the hidden jewels he wanted, because young niece Paula (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ingrid Bergman) watched him commit the crime, she was being cared for following her mother's death. She travels to Italy to try and escape the memory of that terrible night at Number 9 Thornton Square in London, and she trains to become an opera star, and while doing this she meets and falls in love with Gregory Anton (Oscar nominated Charles Boyer). They eventually get married, and he convinces her that she should return home to London and to the house where the horrific incident happened, as it was bequeathed to her, and so that she can calm her anxieties, and all her aunt's possessions will be stashed in the attic. Moving into the house Paula comes across a letter addressed to her aunt, written two days before her murder from someone named Sergius Bauer, Gregory snatches this in a sudden violent way, but he calms and explains that he is only concerned about her. As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical. The young maid Nancy Oliver (Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury) is causing some stirring in the household as well, but there may be help in the form of undercover Scotland Yard Inspector Brian Cameron (The Third Man's Joseph Cotten) who is trying to get to the bottom of the murder, and the location of the missing jewels. He eventually gets close to Paula and convinces her that she may not be going mad after all, and she finds the letter that Gregory had taken from her, it turns out that Gregory is actually Sergius Bauer, he has been searching the attic for the jewels, and he murdered her aunt. The end sees Gregory finally caught for the murder he committed and attempting to steal the jewels that he did manage to find, and with him tied up Paula gets her own back by psychologically torturing him like he did to her. Also starring Barbara Everest as Elizabeth Tompkins, Eustace Wyatt as Budge, Emil Rameau as Maestro Guardi, Edmund Breon as General Huddleston, Halliwell Hobbes as Mr. Muffin, Tom Stevenson as Williams, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Lawrence Grossmith as Lord Dalroy and Jakob Gimpel as Pianist. Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Ingrid Bergman was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!

    a thief, a innocent young woman, a hero. and strange psychological war. a noir but, more that, perfect show of two great actors. because all is in right place, tension as result of details, music, atmosphere, circle of terror and ambiguous pieces of reality. the rules of seduction and the web of spider. the fragility of Ingrid Bergman is part of subtle game of illusion and suffering. Charles Boyer - like insidious snake - creates one of his most precise characters. Angela Lansburry - in one of her roles - is a good surprise. in this conditions, it is more than a good movie. it is example of perfect use of ordinaries ingredients and, in same time, slice of refined art.

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman (Ingrid Bergman) moves back into the house with her new husband (Charles Boyer). However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. I think this is a very different kind of mystery. It involves a murder, but there is never really any doubt about the killer. And it involves a wife thinking she is going crazy, yet we know all along that she is not. (In fact, despite the praise she has received, I think Bergman overdid it a little bit on her acting here... I found it hard to believe that she was that stupid.) Placing the film in the same era as the Jack the Ripper murders was a nice touch, as it could just have easily been the 1940s and the plot would not have been substantially altered. And the debut of Angela Lansbury? Truly remarkable. Who knew she had such a cockney accent inside her? Great film... a very solid performance from very solid talents. George Cukor never fails to succeed.

    To prevent Blacklisting, possibly a spoiler comment. If you are still reading, I watched this film because I am writing a book on Narcissism. Although it is not mentioned in the film description many feel this is where the Narcissistic term, "Gaslighting" comes from. As the film is unfolding and we see the Psychological torture Paula is undergoing through the hands of her husband Gregory, we are left to ponder, why would someone that loves you do this to you on purpose? It is a toxic environment that would slowly drive anyone mad. The wife, Paula, feels as though it is not real or she is somehow imagining it. Unless you have lived through this yourself, I unfortunately have, it is hard to wrap yourself around how torturous this feeling is. It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...

    Great Film in Many Ways, Though Bergman is Uncharacteristically Hammy

    Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, GASLIGHT was made in Great Britain four years previous to this version. Louis B Mayer was so taken with the play that he bought not only the film rights but also the distribution rights to the 1940 film, after which he locked it in the MGM vault so that it was not seen in the States for decades. It is interesting to compare the two versions: most critics seem to place the British original in higher esteem, but I disagree, mainly due to the performances of the two lead actors. Diana Wynyard, an old-style actress in the British tradition, gives a good but rather uninteresting performance; she spends most of the film in a state of near-catatonia which, frankly, gets old fast, while her co-star Anton Walbrook overacts shamelessly all over the place, which has the unfortunate effect of robbing the piece of much of its suspense. George Cukor, known as one of the best directors of actors of his day, makes a vast improvement in the acting in the 1944 version, though he may have gone slightly overboard in the case of Ingrid Bergman. She won her first Oscar for her performance in this film, but it is not her best work: an uneven performance that in spots is a tad bit hammy, something that Bergman practically NEVER did; she was a master at underplaying (see CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS). She's good in GASLIGHT, but as I have already stated in my review of that film, the actress who should have won the Award for 1944 should have been Barbara Stanwyck for her seminal performance as the ultimate femme fatale in Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Ironically, it isn't really Bergman who gives the best lead performance here: it's Boyer. Aside from a certain "sourpuss" expression on his face, at the beginning we have no idea what a monster this man is, nor do we have a clue as to what he is planning to do to his adoring young bride. As a result Cukor manages to drag out the suspense in an almost Hitchcock-like fashion until it becomes nearly unbearable. Boyer's Gregory Anton is one of the great screen villains; wearing the mask of a loving husband, he proceeds to drive his wife to the brink of madness in such an effective manner that the term "gaslighting" actually entered the vernacular, as in "He's gaslighting us (meaning "he's lying/misleading/playing us")." To relieve some of the darkness of the main plot, Cukor provides two comic relief characters: local busybody Miss Thwaites, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Dame May Witty, and housemaid Nancy, a saucy little tart who flirts openly with Gregory while at the same time not bothering to conceal her disdain for his wife. Angela Lansbury, all of eighteen years old and making her film debut, sank her teeth into the role of the trampy little bitch and got an Oscar nomination right out of the box for it. It is one of the most auspicious debuts of one of the greatest actresses Hollywood, Broadway, and television have ever been graced with. Also on hand to solve the mystery is Brian Cameron (the great Joseph Cotten in yet another of his fine performances), a Scotland Yard detective who as a young boy idolized Paula's aunt, a famous opera star who was brutally murdered when the girl was in her teens. All of this sounds like I am knocking Bergman, but I really don't mean to. She is one of my favorite actresses of all time, and her performance here is excellent; I am just not sure if it is Oscar-worthy. At any rate I still think Stanwyck should have won. And Bergman gave Oscar performances in many other films for which she was not always recognized with so much as a nomination: NOTORIOUS, CASABLANCA, and THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS come to mind, to mention only a few. At any rate, any film effective enough that its title becomes part of the language is obviously operating on a higher level than most films, Oscar or no Oscar.

    American audiences did not get to see the 1940 British version of "Angel Street" for many years after MGM planned its own version with an exciting cast, a famous director and its typical glossy production values. While a viewing of the 1940 version might cause some to put down its American remake, that version does stand out for excellent performances, lavish sets and costumes and lush photography, even if it comes up a bit short in what the 1940 version made up in far more recognizable technical achievements that make that version seem even newer than its remake. Poor Ingrid Bergman has memories of the murder of her aunt in her London home when she was much younger and has avoided stepping into the house for many years. A chance encounter with a newer resident of that street (Dame May Witty) brings back memories, and faster than Dame May can utter "Well!", Bergman is returning home with her new husband (Charles Boyer) who is all charm and culture on the outside but hiding a dangerous secret on the inside. No sooner have they remodeled the old homestead than Bergman seems to undergo some mental anguish. She is forgetful, apparently looses things, has crying spells for no apparent reason, and Boyer tells her he fears she is on the verge of loosing her mind, he claims, exactly like her mother did. A curious young man (Joseph Cotten) takes notice of Bergman and Boyer and ingratiates himself with the nosy neighbor Dame May while Boyer himself seems enamored of the new cockney maid (Angela Lansbury). This is as dark and Gothic as the title says, the "Gaslight" having two meanings: the form of artificial lighting which the pre-excessive electricity day world lived with, and a psychological manipulation of destroying another person by making them doubt their own sanity. Both Bergman and Boyer are outstanding, and she combines both vulnerability and confusion in her character who is certain she is not guilty of the things she has been accused of, even though there is no other explanation for them. Boyer's character switches early on from suave to suddenly sinister, taking away any romantic image you may have of him from such earlier classics as "Conquest" and "Love Affair". Dame May adds obvious comic relief, but her stereotypical nosy neighbor has more to do than just peak through curtains and swipe a strawberry from the deaf cook. As for brand new to the screen Lansbury, you won't soon forget the image of her in her truly trashy get-up, and the way she treats Bergman with such obvious contempt in spite of being employed by her makes her almost a Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") in training. Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to. While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior. As directed by George Cukor, this ends up a triumph that overshadowed the original version simply because MGM's head (Louis B.

    In London, beautiful young Ingrid Bergman (as Paula Alquist) is taken away from 9 Thornton Square after the strangulation of her guardian aunt, a renowned opera singer.

    The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian! The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense. If on the ruins of our world, aliens from another planet were to some day enquire about the most representative Western movie ever made - it would be "Gaslight" (1944).

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman moves back into the house with her new husband. However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. If you ask me, this movie is great! Gaslight is a remarkable movie, it's a remarkable movie indeed! I watched this movie yesterday at it's a masterpiece that is directed by another one of the greatest directors of all time, George Cukor, the director of movies like My Fair Lady and The Philadelphia Story. Ingrid Bergman who appeared in Casablanca won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in this movie, as she was absolutely outstanding! We also have a great performance from Charles Boyer, who is trying to prove to Ingrid Bergman's character that she is absolutely mad. And George Cukor's directing is superb, as it usually is! Cukor was a genius, he was an absolute genius. This movie gets a ten out of ten from me, it's a marvelous movie directed by a great director and has a great cast too! In addition to the great acting and directing, the cinematography is stunning. As with most black and white movies, the cinematography adds a dark dramatic appearance to a movie, and in some cases, it even makes the movie a little bit eerie and creepy! But you want to know something? That's just the way that I like it, I love black and white cinematography, I love the dark appearances of the movies! Getting back to Gaslight, I can't think of one negative thing to say about it, as the acting, the cinematography, the directing, or in short, everything is so great, that it is impossible to think of anything that is not to like about the movie. I'll definitely add this movie to my list of great movies, as it is another movie that came out during the golden age of film. Nowadays, with only a few exceptions, they don't seem to make movies that way they used to make them, if they did, then maybe the film industry would be much more prosperous. So all in all, Gaslight is another movie that I can say is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I have heard nothing but great things about it, and all of these great things are absolutely true, as this movie really is a great movie! Gaslight is another movie that you must watch whenever you have the time to do so, as you will say that this movie is a great movie that you will not regret watching! Bravo to George Cukor, Charles Boyer, and especially to Ingrid Bergman for working together to film such a great movie! By the way, something I forget to mention, there are a few scenes in this movie that may leave you wanting to question your own sanity, and I really love a movie like that! In short, Gaslight is a movie that you should definitely watch if you haven't done so already, as it is an absolutely superb movie that exceeds on just about every single level that there is! 10/10

    I knew this film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but it was only after watching it I found out that the leading actress won the Oscar, so I was satisfied twice, from director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, Born Yesterday, A Star Is Born, My Fair Lady). Basically famous opera singer Alice Alquist has been murdered, and the perpetrator escaped without the hidden jewels he wanted, because young niece Paula (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ingrid Bergman) watched him commit the crime, she was being cared for following her mother's death. She travels to Italy to try and escape the memory of that terrible night at Number 9 Thornton Square in London, and she trains to become an opera star, and while doing this she meets and falls in love with Gregory Anton (Oscar nominated Charles Boyer). They eventually get married, and he convinces her that she should return home to London and to the house where the horrific incident happened, as it was bequeathed to her, and so that she can calm her anxieties, and all her aunt's possessions will be stashed in the attic. Moving into the house Paula comes across a letter addressed to her aunt, written two days before her murder from someone named Sergius Bauer, Gregory snatches this in a sudden violent way, but he calms and explains that he is only concerned about her. As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical. The young maid Nancy Oliver (Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury) is causing some stirring in the household as well, but there may be help in the form of undercover Scotland Yard Inspector Brian Cameron (The Third Man's Joseph Cotten) who is trying to get to the bottom of the murder, and the location of the missing jewels. He eventually gets close to Paula and convinces her that she may not be going mad after all, and she finds the letter that Gregory had taken from her, it turns out that Gregory is actually Sergius Bauer, he has been searching the attic for the jewels, and he murdered her aunt. The end sees Gregory finally caught for the murder he committed and attempting to steal the jewels that he did manage to find, and with him tied up Paula gets her own back by psychologically torturing him like he did to her. Also starring Barbara Everest as Elizabeth Tompkins, Eustace Wyatt as Budge, Emil Rameau as Maestro Guardi, Edmund Breon as General Huddleston, Halliwell Hobbes as Mr. Muffin, Tom Stevenson as Williams, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Lawrence Grossmith as Lord Dalroy and Jakob Gimpel as Pianist. Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Ingrid Bergman was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!

    a thief, a innocent young woman, a hero. and strange psychological war. a noir but, more that, perfect show of two great actors. because all is in right place, tension as result of details, music, atmosphere, circle of terror and ambiguous pieces of reality. the rules of seduction and the web of spider. the fragility of Ingrid Bergman is part of subtle game of illusion and suffering. Charles Boyer - like insidious snake - creates one of his most precise characters. Angela Lansburry - in one of her roles - is a good surprise. in this conditions, it is more than a good movie. it is example of perfect use of ordinaries ingredients and, in same time, slice of refined art.

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman (Ingrid Bergman) moves back into the house with her new husband (Charles Boyer). However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. I think this is a very different kind of mystery. It involves a murder, but there is never really any doubt about the killer. And it involves a wife thinking she is going crazy, yet we know all along that she is not. (In fact, despite the praise she has received, I think Bergman overdid it a little bit on her acting here... I found it hard to believe that she was that stupid.) Placing the film in the same era as the Jack the Ripper murders was a nice touch, as it could just have easily been the 1940s and the plot would not have been substantially altered. And the debut of Angela Lansbury? Truly remarkable. Who knew she had such a cockney accent inside her? Great film... a very solid performance from very solid talents. George Cukor never fails to succeed.

    To prevent Blacklisting, possibly a spoiler comment. If you are still reading, I watched this film because I am writing a book on Narcissism. Although it is not mentioned in the film description many feel this is where the Narcissistic term, "Gaslighting" comes from. As the film is unfolding and we see the Psychological torture Paula is undergoing through the hands of her husband Gregory, we are left to ponder, why would someone that loves you do this to you on purpose? It is a toxic environment that would slowly drive anyone mad. The wife, Paula, feels as though it is not real or she is somehow imagining it. Unless you have lived through this yourself, I unfortunately have, it is hard to wrap yourself around how torturous this feeling is. It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...

    Great Film in Many Ways, Though Bergman is Uncharacteristically Hammy

    Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, GASLIGHT was made in Great Britain four years previous to this version. Louis B Mayer was so taken with the play that he bought not only the film rights but also the distribution rights to the 1940 film, after which he locked it in the MGM vault so that it was not seen in the States for decades. It is interesting to compare the two versions: most critics seem to place the British original in higher esteem, but I disagree, mainly due to the performances of the two lead actors. Diana Wynyard, an old-style actress in the British tradition, gives a good but rather uninteresting performance; she spends most of the film in a state of near-catatonia which, frankly, gets old fast, while her co-star Anton Walbrook overacts shamelessly all over the place, which has the unfortunate effect of robbing the piece of much of its suspense. George Cukor, known as one of the best directors of actors of his day, makes a vast improvement in the acting in the 1944 version, though he may have gone slightly overboard in the case of Ingrid Bergman. She won her first Oscar for her performance in this film, but it is not her best work: an uneven performance that in spots is a tad bit hammy, something that Bergman practically NEVER did; she was a master at underplaying (see CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS). She's good in GASLIGHT, but as I have already stated in my review of that film, the actress who should have won the Award for 1944 should have been Barbara Stanwyck for her seminal performance as the ultimate femme fatale in Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Ironically, it isn't really Bergman who gives the best lead performance here: it's Boyer. Aside from a certain "sourpuss" expression on his face, at the beginning we have no idea what a monster this man is, nor do we have a clue as to what he is planning to do to his adoring young bride. As a result Cukor manages to drag out the suspense in an almost Hitchcock-like fashion until it becomes nearly unbearable. Boyer's Gregory Anton is one of the great screen villains; wearing the mask of a loving husband, he proceeds to drive his wife to the brink of madness in such an effective manner that the term "gaslighting" actually entered the vernacular, as in "He's gaslighting us (meaning "he's lying/misleading/playing us")." To relieve some of the darkness of the main plot, Cukor provides two comic relief characters: local busybody Miss Thwaites, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Dame May Witty, and housemaid Nancy, a saucy little tart who flirts openly with Gregory while at the same time not bothering to conceal her disdain for his wife. Angela Lansbury, all of eighteen years old and making her film debut, sank her teeth into the role of the trampy little bitch and got an Oscar nomination right out of the box for it. It is one of the most auspicious debuts of one of the greatest actresses Hollywood, Broadway, and television have ever been graced with. Also on hand to solve the mystery is Brian Cameron (the great Joseph Cotten in yet another of his fine performances), a Scotland Yard detective who as a young boy idolized Paula's aunt, a famous opera star who was brutally murdered when the girl was in her teens. All of this sounds like I am knocking Bergman, but I really don't mean to. She is one of my favorite actresses of all time, and her performance here is excellent; I am just not sure if it is Oscar-worthy. At any rate I still think Stanwyck should have won. And Bergman gave Oscar performances in many other films for which she was not always recognized with so much as a nomination: NOTORIOUS, CASABLANCA, and THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS come to mind, to mention only a few. At any rate, any film effective enough that its title becomes part of the language is obviously operating on a higher level than most films, Oscar or no Oscar.

    American audiences did not get to see the 1940 British version of "Angel Street" for many years after MGM planned its own version with an exciting cast, a famous director and its typical glossy production values. While a viewing of the 1940 version might cause some to put down its American remake, that version does stand out for excellent performances, lavish sets and costumes and lush photography, even if it comes up a bit short in what the 1940 version made up in far more recognizable technical achievements that make that version seem even newer than its remake. Poor Ingrid Bergman has memories of the murder of her aunt in her London home when she was much younger and has avoided stepping into the house for many years. A chance encounter with a newer resident of that street (Dame May Witty) brings back memories, and faster than Dame May can utter "Well!", Bergman is returning home with her new husband (Charles Boyer) who is all charm and culture on the outside but hiding a dangerous secret on the inside. No sooner have they remodeled the old homestead than Bergman seems to undergo some mental anguish. She is forgetful, apparently looses things, has crying spells for no apparent reason, and Boyer tells her he fears she is on the verge of loosing her mind, he claims, exactly like her mother did. A curious young man (Joseph Cotten) takes notice of Bergman and Boyer and ingratiates himself with the nosy neighbor Dame May while Boyer himself seems enamored of the new cockney maid (Angela Lansbury). This is as dark and Gothic as the title says, the "Gaslight" having two meanings: the form of artificial lighting which the pre-excessive electricity day world lived with, and a psychological manipulation of destroying another person by making them doubt their own sanity. Both Bergman and Boyer are outstanding, and she combines both vulnerability and confusion in her character who is certain she is not guilty of the things she has been accused of, even though there is no other explanation for them. Boyer's character switches early on from suave to suddenly sinister, taking away any romantic image you may have of him from such earlier classics as "Conquest" and "Love Affair". Dame May adds obvious comic relief, but her stereotypical nosy neighbor has more to do than just peak through curtains and swipe a strawberry from the deaf cook. As for brand new to the screen Lansbury, you won't soon forget the image of her in her truly trashy get-up, and the way she treats Bergman with such obvious contempt in spite of being employed by her makes her almost a Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") in training. Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to. While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior. As directed by George Cukor, this ends up a triumph that overshadowed the original version simply because MGM's head (Louis B. Mayer) kept the other version hid in preparation for the release of this version which he didn't want overshadowed.

    What an intense drama about psychological abuse, and implants the virulent dual-murders, one from the past and another is ongoing, one is fulfilled and the other is up in the air, George Cukor (from MY FAIR LADY 1964, 6/10; A STAR IS BORN 1954, 8/10 and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY 1940, 8/10) blindsided me with his own creation of film noir, and conducts Boyer and Bergman's career-best performances. An unsolved crime at the beginning, the film drops from a whodunit detective story rather early, after the a short spell of foreign sojourn (Lake Como, where else would be more romantic?), the newly-weds returns to London, for Paula (Bergman), the scar dooms to be lifted open and the bare wound is even more deleterious than she could ever imagine. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's play "ANGEL STREET", the film predominantly is a two-hander between Paula and Gregory (Boyer), and about how Gregory punctiliously and effectively manipulates and impairs Paula's mental state, he ensnares Paulo into a self-doubt of her sanity (the very first outing in London is to visit the torture chamber, no wonder all the Museums of Torture are prevailing in the touristic attractions here in Europe), insulating her from meeting other people, trapped her in the mansion and slowly yet mercilessly infuses all the hallucinogenic chicanery to further damage her flimsy nerve, which includes the titular gaslight and it also serves as a signpost of his surreptitious whereabout every night. Boyer is quite extraordinary in expressing venom under his high-and-mighty politeness, frowning and pouting, his devilish complexion enlivens the film's watchability even at its corniest part, a bestial man indeed, but a tour-de-force exemplar of his kind. Bergman, although is the hapless victim who is unwittingly sleeping with the enemy, very anti-femme- fatale indeed, manages to deliver a visceral transition of Paula's trauma, which certainly out of her usual graceful and elegant comfort zone, and albeit her Nordic height, it is such a stretch for her to reveal her female vulnerability without any reservation. She got her first Oscar for the film, I'm now wavering in choosing my pick between her and Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's noir paradigm DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10). A third-billed Joseph Cotten is the cardboard detective eventually will be the hero, and Dame May Witty, the garrulous busybody, appears sporadically in case she overstays her welcome. The film is also Angela Lansbury's film debut, at the age of 17 during the shoot, the young flighty maid might only be a pawn in the plot, but a rather singular boldness and an Oscar nomination presages her reverend orbit as one of the most versatile character-actress in the Hollywood history. Overall, the film is a highly-recommendable piece of psychological study, shot in minimal bleakness (even the gala concert is intentionally shortened) with solemn and choppy original score from Bronislau Kaper. From a modern-day POV, one might find Paula is a stereotyped exploitation about how women usually are portrayed in the yesteryear, which seems out of topicality now (not domestic violence, just the showcase of female's utter dependence and extreme delicacy), so, it might undermine the reception from the younger generation, but anyway, at least, a big bravo to Bergman and Boyer.

    In London, beautiful young Ingrid Bergman (as Paula Alquist) is taken away from 9 Thornton Square after the strangulation of her guardian aunt, a renowned opera singer. The murder is unsolved and a fortune in jewels disappears. Years later, Ms. Bergman takes singing lessons in Italy, hoping to follow in her aunt's footsteps. She falls in love with older French pianist Charles Boyer (as Gregory Anton). The newlyweds move to Bergman's inherited home in Thornton Square, site of the earlier tragedy. Lower class Angela Lansbury (as Nancy) and Barbara Everest (as Elizabeth) are hired as housekeeper and cook... The dimming of "Gaslight" and other mysteries ensue... Scotland Yard investigator Joseph Cotten (as Brian Cameron) is suspicious and elderly neighbor May Witty (as Miss Thwaites) is nosy. This is a re-make of the superior British "Gaslight" (1940). Although the leads often seem overly posed (it is, after all, seen through the productive lenses at MGM), all perform exceptionally for director George Cukor. Everything looks exquisite as photographed in black-and white by Joseph Ruttenberg. Bergman won a "Best Actress" Oscar for her high strung portrayal and Ms. Lansbury got a nomination in her first screen credit. ******** Gaslight (5/4/44) George Cukor ~ Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten, Angela Lansbury

    The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian! The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense.

They eventually get married, and he convinces her that she should return home to London and to the house where the horrific incident happened, as it was bequeathed to her, and so that she can calm her anxieties, and all her aunt's possessions will be stashed in the attic. Moving into the house Paula comes across a letter addressed to her aunt, written two days before her murder from someone named Sergius Bauer, Gregory snatches this in a sudden violent way, but he calms and explains that he is only concerned about her. As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical. The young maid Nancy Oliver (Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury) is causing some stirring in the household as well, but there may be help in the form of undercover Scotland Yard Inspector Brian Cameron (The Third Man's Joseph Cotten) who is trying to get to the bottom of the murder, and the location of the missing jewels. He eventually gets close to Paula and convinces her that she may not be going mad after all, and she finds the letter that Gregory had taken from her, it turns out that Gregory is actually Sergius Bauer, he has been searching the attic for the jewels, and he murdered her aunt. The end sees Gregory finally caught for the murder he committed and attempting to steal the jewels that he did manage to find, and with him tied up Paula gets her own back by psychologically torturing him like he did to her. Also starring Barbara Everest as Elizabeth Tompkins, Eustace Wyatt as Budge, Emil Rameau as Maestro Guardi, Edmund Breon as General Huddleston, Halliwell Hobbes as Mr. Muffin, Tom Stevenson as Williams, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Lawrence Grossmith as Lord Dalroy and Jakob Gimpel as Pianist. Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Ingrid Bergman was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman (Ingrid Bergman) moves back into the house with her new husband (Charles Boyer). However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. I think this is a very different kind of mystery. It involves a murder, but there is never really any doubt about the killer. And it involves a wife thinking she is going crazy, yet we know all along that she is not. (In fact, despite the praise she has received, I think Bergman overdid it a little bit on her acting here... I found it hard to believe that she was that stupid.) Placing the film in the same era as the Jack the Ripper murders was a nice touch, as it could just have easily been the 1940s and the plot would not have been substantially altered. And the debut of Angela Lansbury? Truly remarkable. Who knew she had such a cockney accent inside her? Great film... a very solid performance from very solid talents. George Cukor never fails to succeed.

    To prevent Blacklisting, possibly a spoiler comment. If you are still reading, I watched this film because I am writing a book on Narcissism. Although it is not mentioned in the film description many feel this is where the Narcissistic term, "Gaslighting" comes from. As the film is unfolding and we see the Psychological torture Paula is undergoing through the hands of her husband Gregory, we are left to ponder, why would someone that loves you do this to you on purpose? It is a toxic environment that would slowly drive anyone mad. The wife, Paula, feels as though it is not real or she is somehow imagining it. Unless you have lived through this yourself, I unfortunately have, it is hard to wrap yourself around how torturous this feeling is. It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...

    Great Film in Many Ways, Though Bergman is Uncharacteristically Hammy

    Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, GASLIGHT was made in Great Britain four years previous to this version. Louis B Mayer was so taken with the play that he bought not only the film rights but also the distribution rights to the 1940 film, after which he locked it in the MGM vault so that it was not seen in the States for decades. It is interesting to compare the two versions: most critics seem to place the British original in higher esteem, but I disagree, mainly due to the performances of the two lead actors. Diana Wynyard, an old-style actress in the British tradition, gives a good but rather uninteresting performance; she spends most of the film in a state of near-catatonia which, frankly, gets old fast, while her co-star Anton Walbrook overacts shamelessly all over the place, which has the unfortunate effect of robbing the piece of much of its suspense. George Cukor, known as one of the best directors of actors of his day, makes a vast improvement in the acting in the 1944 version, though he may have gone slightly overboard in the case of Ingrid Bergman. She won her first Oscar for her performance in this film, but it is not her best work: an uneven performance that in spots is a tad bit hammy, something that Bergman practically NEVER did; she was a master at underplaying (see CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS). She's good in GASLIGHT, but as I have already stated in my review of that film, the actress who should have won the Award for 1944 should have been Barbara Stanwyck for her seminal performance as the ultimate femme fatale in Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Ironically, it isn't really Bergman who gives the best lead performance here: it's Boyer. Aside from a certain "sourpuss" expression on his face, at the beginning we have no idea what a monster this man is, nor do we have a clue as to what he is planning to do to his adoring young bride. As a result Cukor manages to drag out the suspense in an almost Hitchcock-like fashion until it becomes nearly unbearable. Boyer's Gregory Anton is one of the great screen villains; wearing the mask of a loving husband, he proceeds to drive his wife to the brink of madness in such an effective manner that the term "gaslighting" actually entered the vernacular, as in "He's gaslighting us (meaning "he's lying/misleading/playing us")." To relieve some of the darkness of the main plot, Cukor provides two comic relief characters: local busybody Miss Thwaites, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Dame May Witty, and housemaid Nancy, a saucy little tart who flirts openly with Gregory while at the same time not bothering to conceal her disdain for his wife. Angela Lansbury, all of eighteen years old and making her film debut, sank her teeth into the role of the trampy little bitch and got an Oscar nomination right out of the box for it. It is one of the most auspicious debuts of one of the greatest actresses Hollywood, Broadway, and television have ever been graced with. Also on hand to solve the mystery is Brian Cameron (the great Joseph Cotten in yet another of his fine performances), a Scotland Yard detective who as a young boy idolized Paula's aunt, a famous opera star who was brutally murdered when the girl was in her teens. All of this sounds like I am knocking Bergman, but I really don't mean to. She is one of my favorite actresses of all time, and her performance here is excellent; I am just not sure if it is Oscar-worthy. At any rate I still think Stanwyck should have won. And Bergman gave Oscar performances in many other films for which she was not always recognized with so much as a nomination: NOTORIOUS, CASABLANCA, and THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS come to mind, to mention only a few. At any rate, any film effective enough that its title becomes part of the language is obviously operating on a higher level than most films, Oscar or no Oscar.

    American audiences did not get to see the 1940 British version of "Angel Street" for many years after MGM planned its own version with an exciting cast, a famous director and its typical glossy production values. While a viewing of the 1940 version might cause some to put down its American remake, that version does stand out for excellent performances, lavish sets and costumes and lush photography, even if it comes up a bit short in what the 1940 version made up in far more recognizable technical achievements that make that version seem even newer than its remake. Poor Ingrid Bergman has memories of the murder of her aunt in her London home when she was much younger and has avoided stepping into the house for many years. A chance encounter with a newer resident of that street (Dame May Witty) brings back memories, and faster than Dame May can utter "Well!", Bergman is returning home with her new husband (Charles Boyer) who is all charm and culture on the outside but hiding a dangerous secret on the inside. No sooner have they remodeled the old homestead than Bergman seems to undergo some mental anguish. She is forgetful, apparently looses things, has crying spells for no apparent reason, and Boyer tells her he fears she is on the verge of loosing her mind, he claims, exactly like her mother did. A curious young man (Joseph Cotten) takes notice of Bergman and Boyer and ingratiates himself with the nosy neighbor Dame May while Boyer himself seems enamored of the new cockney maid (Angela Lansbury). This is as dark and Gothic as the title says, the "Gaslight" having two meanings: the form of artificial lighting which the pre-excessive electricity day world lived with, and a psychological manipulation of destroying another person by making them doubt their own sanity. Both Bergman and Boyer are outstanding, and she combines both vulnerability and confusion in her character who is certain she is not guilty of the things she has been accused of, even though there is no other explanation for them. Boyer's character switches early on from suave to suddenly sinister, taking away any romantic image you may have of him from such earlier classics as "Conquest" and "Love Affair". Dame May adds obvious comic relief, but her stereotypical nosy neighbor has more to do than just peak through curtains and swipe a strawberry from the deaf cook. As for brand new to the screen Lansbury, you won't soon forget the image of her in her truly trashy get-up, and the way she treats Bergman with such obvious contempt in spite of being employed by her makes her almost a Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") in training. Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to. While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior. As directed by George Cukor, this ends up a triumph that overshadowed the original version simply because MGM's head (Louis B. Mayer) kept the other version hid in preparation for the release of this version which he didn't want overshadowed.

    What an intense drama about psychological abuse, and implants the virulent dual-murders, one from the past and another is ongoing, one is fulfilled and the other is up in the air, George Cukor (from MY FAIR LADY 1964, 6/10; A STAR IS BORN 1954, 8/10 and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY 1940, 8/10) blindsided me with his own creation of film noir, and conducts Boyer and Bergman's career-best performances. An unsolved crime at the beginning, the film drops from a whodunit detective story rather early, after the a short spell of foreign sojourn (Lake Como, where else would be more romantic?), the newly-weds returns to London, for Paula (Bergman), the scar dooms to be lifted open and the bare wound is even more deleterious than she could ever imagine. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's play "ANGEL STREET", the film predominantly is a two-hander between Paula and Gregory (Boyer), and about how Gregory punctiliously and effectively manipulates and impairs Paula's mental state, he ensnares Paulo into a self-doubt of her sanity (the very first outing in London is to visit the torture chamber, no wonder all the Museums of Torture are prevailing in the touristic attractions here in Europe), insulating her from meeting other people, trapped her in the mansion and slowly yet mercilessly infuses all the hallucinogenic chicanery to further damage her flimsy nerve, which includes the titular gaslight and it also serves as a signpost of his surreptitious whereabout every night. Boyer is quite extraordinary in expressing venom under his high-and-mighty politeness, frowning and pouting, his devilish complexion enlivens the film's watchability even at its corniest part, a bestial man indeed, but a tour-de-force exemplar of his kind. Bergman, although is the hapless victim who is unwittingly sleeping with the enemy, very anti-femme- fatale indeed, manages to deliver a visceral transition of Paula's trauma, which certainly out of her usual graceful and elegant comfort zone, and albeit her Nordic height, it is such a stretch for her to reveal her female vulnerability without any reservation. She got her first Oscar for the film, I'm now wavering in choosing my pick between her and Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's noir paradigm DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10). A third-billed Joseph Cotten is the cardboard detective eventually will be the hero, and Dame May Witty, the garrulous busybody, appears sporadically in case she overstays her welcome. The film is also Angela Lansbury's film debut, at the age of 17 during the shoot, the young flighty maid might only be a pawn in the plot, but a rather singular boldness and an Oscar nomination presages her reverend orbit as one of the most versatile character-actress in the Hollywood history. Overall, the film is a highly-recommendable piece of psychological study, shot in minimal bleakness (even the gala concert is intentionally shortened) with solemn and choppy original score from Bronislau Kaper. From a modern-day POV, one might find Paula is a stereotyped exploitation about how women usually are portrayed in the yesteryear, which seems out of topicality now (not domestic violence, just the showcase of female's utter dependence and extreme delicacy), so, it might undermine the reception from the younger generation, but anyway, at least, a big bravo to Bergman and Boyer.

    In London, beautiful young Ingrid Bergman (as Paula Alquist) is taken away from 9 Thornton Square after the strangulation of her guardian aunt, a renowned opera singer. The murder is unsolved and a fortune in jewels disappears. Years later, Ms. Bergman takes singing lessons in Italy, hoping to follow in her aunt's footsteps. She falls in love with older French pianist Charles Boyer (as Gregory Anton). The newlyweds move to Bergman's inherited home in Thornton Square, site of the earlier tragedy. Lower class Angela Lansbury (as Nancy) and Barbara Everest (as Elizabeth) are hired as housekeeper and cook... The dimming of "Gaslight" and other mysteries ensue... Scotland Yard investigator Joseph Cotten (as Brian Cameron) is suspicious and elderly neighbor May Witty (as Miss Thwaites) is nosy. This is a re-make of the superior British "Gaslight" (1940). Although the leads often seem overly posed (it is, after all, seen through the productive lenses at MGM), all perform exceptionally for director George Cukor. Everything looks exquisite as photographed in black-and white by Joseph Ruttenberg. Bergman won a "Best Actress" Oscar for her high strung portrayal and Ms. Lansbury got a nomination in her first screen credit. ******** Gaslight (5/4/44) George Cukor ~ Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten, Angela Lansbury

    The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian! The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense. If on the ruins of our world, aliens from another planet were to some day enquire about the most representative Western movie ever made - it would be "Gaslight" (1944).

    Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman moves back into the house with her new husband. However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane. If you ask me, this movie is great! Gaslight is a remarkable movie, it's a remarkable movie indeed! I watched this movie yesterday at it's a masterpiece that is directed by another one of the greatest directors of all time, George Cukor, the director of movies like My Fair Lady and The Philadelphia Story. Ingrid Bergman who appeared in Casablanca won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in this movie, as she was absolutely outstanding! We also have a great performance from Charles Boyer, who is trying to prove to Ingrid Bergman's character that she is absolutely mad. And George Cukor's directing is superb, as it usually is! Cukor was a genius, he was an absolute genius. This movie gets a ten out of ten from me, it's a marvelous movie directed by a great director and has a great cast too! In addition to the great acting and directing, the cinematography is stunning. As with most black and white movies, the cinematography adds a dark dramatic appearance to a movie, and in some cases, it even makes the movie a little bit eerie and creepy! But you want to know something? That's just the way that I like it, I love black and white cinematography, I love the dark appearances of the movies! Getting back to Gaslight, I can't think of one negative thing to say about it, as the acting, the cinematography, the directing, or in short, everything is so great, that it is impossible to think of anything that is not to like about the movie. I'll definitely add this movie to my list of great movies, as it is another movie that came out during the golden age of film. Nowadays, with only a few exceptions, they don't seem to make movies that way they used to make them, if they did, then maybe the film industry would be much more prosperous. So all in all, Gaslight is another movie that I can say is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I have heard nothing but great things about it, and all of these great things are absolutely true, as this movie really is a great movie! Gaslight is another movie that you must watch whenever you have the time to do so, as you will say that this movie is a great movie that you will not regret watching! Bravo to George Cukor, Charles Boyer, and especially to Ingrid Bergman for working together to film such a great movie! By the way, something I forget to mention, there are a few scenes in this movie that may leave you wanting to question your own sanity, and I really love a movie like that! In short, Gaslight is a movie that you should definitely watch if you haven't done so already, as it is an absolutely superb movie that exceeds on just about every single level that there is! 10/10

    I knew this film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but it was only after watching it I found out that the leading actress won the Oscar, so I was satisfied twice, from director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, Born Yesterday, A Star Is Born, My Fair Lady). Basically famous opera singer Alice Alquist has been murdered, and the perpetrator escaped without the hidden jewels he wanted, because young niece Paula (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ingrid Bergman) watched him commit the crime, she was being cared for following her mother's death. She travels to Italy to try and escape the memory of that terrible night at Number 9 Thornton Square in London, and she trains to become an opera star, and while doing this she meets and falls in love with Gregory Anton (Oscar nominated Charles Boyer). They eventually get married, and he convinces her that she should return home to London and to the house where the horrific incident happened, as it was bequeathed to her, and so that she can calm her anxieties, and all her aunt's possessions will be stashed in the attic. Moving into the house Paula comes across a letter addressed to her aunt, written two days before her murder from someone named Sergius Bauer, Gregory snatches this in a sudden violent way, but he calms and explains that he is only concerned about her. As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical. The young maid Nancy Oliver (Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury) is causing some stirring in the household as well, but there may be help in the form of undercover Scotland Yard Inspector Brian Cameron (The Third Man's Joseph Cotten) who is trying to get to the bottom of the murder, and the location of the missing jewels. He eventually gets close to Paula and convinces her that she may not be going mad after all, and she finds the letter that Gregory had taken from her, it turns out that Gregory is actually Sergius Bauer, he has been searching the attic for the jewels, and he murdered her aunt. The end sees Gregory finally caught for the murder he committed and attempting to steal the jewels that he did manage to find, and with him tied up Paula gets her own back by psychologically torturing him like he did to her. Also starring Barbara Everest as Elizabeth Tompkins, Eustace Wyatt as Budge, Emil Rameau as Maestro Guardi, Edmund Breon as General Huddleston, Halliwell Hobbes as Mr. Muffin, Tom Stevenson as Williams, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Lawrence Grossmith as Lord Dalroy and Jakob Gimpel as Pianist. Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Ingrid Bergman was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!

It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...
