    My favorite one! It is surprising for me that this is directed in 1982. Time traveling is an eternal dream of us and this movie depicts it so effectively. Terminator series' concept is the war between humans and machines. I was impressed by this that at time of 1982, how could the director anticipate the future of our society with machines! Now look at our daily life. Isn't our world getting close to the Terminator's world? We have to get in our mind the alert from this movie. The first one of the series is always the key of the whole story. At the end of the movie, it suggests that "he will be back"

    In the future, the world has been taken over by SkyNet, a computer program that became sentient and launched a global nuclear holocaust. However a single man John Conner leads a human resistance that is on the verge of destroying SkyNet. SkyNet sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill the mother of John Conner. The resistance sends a soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to defend against the machine and save Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). This is director James Cameron's first baby, and he hit it out of the park. It is perfection that started the franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting really streamline the story. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He makes for the perfect machine. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It has the power of a much bigger film.

    The Terminator is a classic! Yes, I said a classic. Of the four movies so far this is my third favorite, behind the third and fourth movies. The graphics are just what you would expect from a movie that was made in the early 1980's. At the time the graphics were state of the art. However, today they are antiquated, which makes this a classic. The story was unique. Before 1984 there were scripts and plots that had robot that looked robotic, or monsters that looked like monsters. In 1984, James Cameron gave us The Terminator, a machine that can't be "bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead." The script revolves around Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who is the mother of John Connor, a future leader who fights and eventually defeats Skynet. Skynet developed technology to travel back in time in the hopes of killing Sarah Connor to prevent John Connor's birth. The human resistance sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save Sarah Connor and stop, if possible, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). As always I will list my three favorite scenes. As this movie has been around for nearly 30 years I have no issue in including any scene from the beginning to the end. The first scene I liked was when Sarah is in the nightclub waiting for the cops. She is being followed by Reese and the Terminator. When the Terminator walks by the table Sarah happens to drop something on the floor and bends over to pick it up. The Terminator eventually sees Sarah and moves in for the kill, but Reese intervenes. The second scene I liked was actually all of the flashback scenes for Reese. They were flashback scenes for Reese but would be flash-forwards for us. It gets a little confusing for when you talk about time travel. The third scene I liked was the final scene when Sarah defeats the Terminator. Reese is killed when he puts a pipe bomb in some of the Terminators gears. The resulting explosion kills Reese, cripples the Terminator, and injures Sarah. Sarah defeats the Terminator by crushing it. Before I finish this review I do have something to say. I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger. I give this 8 stars out of 10.

    The Terminator (James Cameron, 1984) It's easy to see how The Terminator put James Cameron on the map. Whether or not the story is entirely original (and of course, like maybe all sci-fi concepts, it's been done again and again, in the Doctor Who story Day of the Daleks just to name one example), the way Cameron put it all together is impressive. The storyline generates lots of genuine suspense, even when you know exactly what's going to happen, even when you know how it will happen. Linda Hamilton makes a great protagonist, her character arc developing quite believably given her performance. The special effects and the dialogue are sometimes a bit cheesy... but it was the Eighties, what can you do? The chase/fight scenes are not overdone (unlike certain newer movies like Man of Steel and Pacific Rim). The sequence of the police psychologist interviewing Reese provides some welcome comic relief, as do a couple of other sequences here and there. Arnold Schwarzenegger's questionable acting abilities are actually put to good advantage: he plays a believable robot. Overall I am pleased with The Terminator, which deserves its positive reputation as a force of pop culture. Solid piece of science fiction too. Sarah Connor was just damn lucky she was listed as the last Sarah Connor in the phone book! 9/10

    James Cameron (writer - director) at the time was known only by the awful trash movie "Piranha II". Hollywood not even knew his name (today when confirms a movie it already causes controversy, like start doing years later Tarantino) and when "Terminator" was announced none company was very interested in producing it. And when it came out it was not only a box office success but also became critically acclaimed and till today still considered an ultimate classic film. "The Terminator" was revolutionary for the time it came out, not only because it was made with a low budget and was extremely successful, but many at the time (and even today) consider the film only as a good action movie, but Cameron gave very more than that, the story of the film is something that had never been seen before. Everything begins with two successive murders that occurred in Los Angeles, both murders cause controversy and polemic because both victims had the same name, "Sarah Connor". The news reaches the ears of a third Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a beautiful and friendly waitress who begins to feel persecuted. After contacting the police from a nightclub, the Lieutenant Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) asks Sarah to wait for a police car to go pick her up. While waiting, Sarah is surprised by a huge man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who point a gun at her, but is surprised by a shot from Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who save Sarah's life (at least for a while). Sarah now finds herself in a frenetic chase for her life, but her mysterious savior has more secrets about Sarah that she can imagine and about the mysterious killer who proves to be a real killing machine called "Terminator 101". Nowadays this story (or derivatives of it) is used and reused becoming boring and clich&eacute;, but it was Cameron who started it all. The film is shown from the beginning as "a day like any other", by which I mean that Cameron delivers to the film a realistic narrative to their characters since swears; stupid teens just enjoying life; everyday language with playful insults; and also pop-cultural references since the shooting at the nightclub and to Sarah's friend, Ginger Ventura (Bess Motta) that never stop listen to music. Yeah, the film feels very realistic, but not only this that was revolutionary in Cameron film, but also delivers and evolves elements of sci  fi: time travel that had only been seen in "Back to the Future " with a good mood and fun style, here it is with a somber and violent tone; an apocalyptic world that was only seen in "Planet of the apes", also through humorous and philosophical tone, here with a scary tone. The film proceeds with a great narrative, but in management and technical aspects the film was shown really ahead of its time. Since the direction of the Cameron with terrific action scenes, also giving a frenetic and thrilling pace when the movie's chase becomes more violent and frightening. And also has an excellent visual direction from Cameron in flashbacks (or flash-ahead because we are talking about the future) in the apocalyptic future with machines reigning over us, all done with a model that served as help to Cameron later in "Titanic". A classic that will live forever in the history of cinema, thanks to a revolutionary and unique history, a fantastic direction, exceptional performance by Schwarzenegger putting him on the map, "The Terminator" revolutionized the action genre and sci-fi mixing both in this unforgettable masterpiece (yeah, James Cameron's masterpiece)! 10/10

    This is one of the most famous movie series in the world. I watched it first time,I regret that I never watched before. It was so exciting and deep story. Terminator is the robot which is a murderer to achieve one purpose. It is to kill a woman named Sara. She is a legendary character in the future.Her son achieved a great work however it was bad for the Terminator and decided to revenge against him and his mother. I've never seen like this so I felt a little fear at first however It's getting hotter and hotter I understood a meaning of story. And my impression point is the latest performance techniques in those days! It made me more exciting. I want to watch other series.

    If there is anyone who actually hasn't seen "The Terminator", I'll write my short opinion, because it was on TV last night and I just couldn't miss it. The plot is very simple... hero, villain, love story, cyborgs, post- apocalyptic futures ... you know, that old story. I won't bother with details, because I don't wanna spoil all the fun and fun is what you'll have if you like sci-fi, action and good old Arnie. The main protagonist is likable and relatable. The villain is awesome... hello?! Good old Ar.... you know already. The action is good, the excitement is there, the story is interesting enough, it wraps up movie nicely while still managing to prepare us for a great sequel (I really like part 2, that s*it is awesome). All the elements are there, so if you haven't... go for it.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger was dead-on perfect playing a cyborg assassin sent from the future by machines(who have enslaved humans) to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton, who has good character development here) who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance that will defeat the machines. Michael Bien plays a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah, but finds himself drawn to her as well. Time is a twisty road though, and the truth was not what either side thought it was... Outstanding film is extremely exciting and taut, with fine F/X, acting and script(not all the ideas are original, but they had never been put on screen so powerfully before.) Writer & director James Cameron made a name for himself with this breathless film, helped by a fantastic music score. A classic!

    The Terminator is easily one of the very best films ever made, in any genre. If i was to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island but could take 10 movies with me, quite probably this one would be on my list. Again, i'm not talking genre here; It's definitely one of the best SciFi/Action movies ever made, but it is also one of the best movies of all kinds ever made. But let's stay with the action side of it for a while though: The action in this flick is simply awesome. Mostly done without special effects and surely without CGI, The Terminator defines cinematic action. This is what celluloid and cameras were invented for. This is the stuff aspiring filmmakers study in order to learn the craft of filming action. There are of course films with more action, but the quality of it is paramount here. Everything feels true, not a false moment, no laughable exagerrations. Camera angles, editing rhythm, performances. All elements are perfect and make the action reach you. This is how it should be done, and the reason why you're at the edge of your seat though you have seen much "phatter", "cooler", "crasser" action in the decades since 1984. Let's have a look at the special effects now. I think the animatronics head shots are still absolutely valid today. The use of stop motion is totally visible, but those shots are not bad enough to catapult you out of the suspense. The model work is quite good most of the time, only some moments are a bit ludicrous. All in all, the effects are very watchable even in 2013 and far from being so bad that they would seriously impact the overall appeal of the film. The music is awesome. I always hate it when a score dictates too much, when it is too classical for a movie, when it is too in-your-face, when it drowns action and emotion in too many notes, melodies, sounds. Here, the score is unnoticeable most of the time, which is always a good thing. Droning eerily in the background, it lets your senses focus on the carnage on the screen and the terror in your mind but also pushes the pace forward with its thumping industrial beats. Then there is the main theme; not much more than a single, brilliant melody, but powerful enough to transcend themes of love, pain, premonition. And when it finally echoes in the love scene, you understand in a split second that this is actually Sarah's theme and the whole movie is actually tinted with her emotions. In the factory scene, the music drastically changes into a horrifying medley of dissonant screeches, making the shift into the third Act just as audible as scraping away the Terminators living tissue and showing us the metal chassis underneath is making it visible. There is not a single bad or even mediocre performance in this movie. All the actors are great, and i think Arnold does a hell of a job. Many people say he can't act but that he didn't need to here because he's playing a machine, so that it was alright. I think that's bullshit. Show me someone acting a machine and i show you someone looking real silly. *It's not that simple!* Arnold always knows what he does. He's a physical, agile actor, and perfect for the role, he makes you believe that this is a programmed killing machine, he makes the whole thing work. Biehn and Hamilton are at the top of their game and have a phenomenal chemistry. All the supporting actors do what they have to do perfectly. One reviewer commented that "the script is one that other screenwriters wished to have thought of first". Another added that it is one of those scripts that is being teached in screen writing seminars; both is true. Cameron and Hurd delivered their masterpiece here. The story is strong, original and meaningful. There are no weak moments, no plot holes. The motivations are strong and genuine, and all the main characters arch. The finale leaves us with a very confident resolution, strong emotions of both the positive and negative variety and is very, very satisfying. In fact, the more you look at the story, the better it becomes. Many people have criticized the time travel plot hole/paradox. But i think it all makes perfect sense: Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the "future". Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask "but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?". But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.

    The Terminator is a movie with a complex background that manages to deliver a simple yet strong story by staying true to the characters. Often times, films that deal with time travel tend to be confusing or full of holes, but The Terminator surprised me by developing a plot that was not only simple but emotional. The settings and mood throughout the entire movie really emphasize a state of panic, and it is definitely a thrilling experience from beginning to end. The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films. Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for. The Terminator takes viewers on a journey of constant fear, anxiety, and panic, and it's exactly because of this that The Terminator is a classic thriller.

    If there is anyone who actually hasn't seen "The Terminator", I'll write my short opinion, because it was on TV last night and I just couldn't miss it. The plot is very simple... hero, villain, love story, cyborgs, post- apocalyptic futures ... you know, that old story. I won't bother with details, because I don't wanna spoil all the fun and fun is what you'll have if you like sci-fi, action and good old Arnie. The main protagonist is likable and relatable. The villain is awesome... hello?! Good old Ar.... you know already. The action is good, the excitement is there, the story is interesting enough, it wraps up movie nicely while still managing to prepare us for a great sequel (I really like part 2, that s*it is awesome). All the elements are there, so if you haven't... go for it.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger was dead-on perfect playing a cyborg assassin sent from the future by machines(who have enslaved humans) to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton, who has good character development here) who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance that will defeat the machines. Michael Bien plays a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah, but finds himself drawn to her as well. Time is a twisty road though, and the truth was not what either side thought it was... Outstanding film is extremely exciting and taut, with fine F/X, acting and script(not all the ideas are original, but they had never been put on screen so powerfully before.) Writer & director James Cameron made a name for himself with this breathless film, helped by a fantastic music score. A classic!

    The Terminator is easily one of the very best films ever made, in any genre. If i was to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island but could take 10 movies with me, quite probably this one would be on my list. Again, i'm not talking genre here; It's definitely one of the best SciFi/Action movies ever made, but it is also one of the best movies of all kinds ever made. But let's stay with the action side of it for a while though: The action in this flick is simply awesome. Mostly done without special effects and surely without CGI, The Terminator defines cinematic action. This is what celluloid and cameras were invented for. This is the stuff aspiring filmmakers study in order to learn the craft of filming action. There are of course films with more action, but the quality of it is paramount here. Everything feels true, not a false moment, no laughable exagerrations. Camera angles, editing rhythm, performances. All elements are perfect and make the action reach you. This is how it should be done, and the reason why you're at the edge of your seat though you have seen much "phatter", "cooler", "crasser" action in the decades since 1984. Let's have a look at the special effects now. I think the animatronics head shots are still absolutely valid today. The use of stop motion is totally visible, but those shots are not bad enough to catapult you out of the suspense. The model work is quite good most of the time, only some moments are a bit ludicrous. All in all, the effects are very watchable even in 2013 and far from being so bad that they would seriously impact the overall appeal of the film. The music is awesome. I always hate it when a score dictates too much, when it is too classical for a movie, when it is too in-your-face, when it drowns action and emotion in too many notes, melodies, sounds. Here, the score is unnoticeable most of the time, which is always a good thing. Droning eerily in the background, it lets your senses focus on the carnage on the screen and the terror in your mind but also pushes the pace forward with its thumping industrial beats. Then there is the main theme; not much more than a single, brilliant melody, but powerful enough to transcend themes of love, pain, premonition. And when it finally echoes in the love scene, you understand in a split second that this is actually Sarah's theme and the whole movie is actually tinted with her emotions. In the factory scene, the music drastically changes into a horrifying medley of dissonant screeches, making the shift into the third Act just as audible as scraping away the Terminators living tissue and showing us the metal chassis underneath is making it visible. There is not a single bad or even mediocre performance in this movie. All the actors are great, and i think Arnold does a hell of a job. Many people say he can't act but that he didn't need to here because he's playing a machine, so that it was alright. I think that's bullshit. Show me someone acting a machine and i show you someone looking real silly. *It's not that simple!* Arnold always knows what he does. He's a physical, agile actor, and perfect for the role, he makes you believe that this is a programmed killing machine, he makes the whole thing work. Biehn and Hamilton are at the top of their game and have a phenomenal chemistry. All the supporting actors do what they have to do perfectly. One reviewer commented that "the script is one that other screenwriters wished to have thought of first". Another added that it is one of those scripts that is being teached in screen writing seminars; both is true. Cameron and Hurd delivered their masterpiece here. The story is strong, original and meaningful. There are no weak moments, no plot holes. The motivations are strong and genuine, and all the main characters arch. The finale leaves us with a very confident resolution, strong emotions of both the positive and negative variety and is very, very satisfying. In fact, the more you look at the story, the better it becomes. Many people have criticized the time travel plot hole/paradox. But i think it all makes perfect sense: Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the "future". Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask "but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?". But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.

    The Terminator is a movie with a complex background that manages to deliver a simple yet strong story by staying true to the characters. Often times, films that deal with time travel tend to be confusing or full of holes, but The Terminator surprised me by developing a plot that was not only simple but emotional. The settings and mood throughout the entire movie really emphasize a state of panic, and it is definitely a thrilling experience from beginning to end. The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films. Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for. The Terminator takes viewers on a journey of constant fear, anxiety, and panic, and it's exactly because of this that The Terminator is a classic thriller.

    My favorite one! It is surprising for me that this is directed in 1982. Time traveling is an eternal dream of us and this movie depicts it so effectively. Terminator series' concept is the war between humans and machines. I was impressed by this that at time of 1982, how could the director anticipate the future of our society with machines! Now look at our daily life. Isn't our world getting close to the Terminator's world? We have to get in our mind the alert from this movie. The first one of the series is always the key of the whole story. At the end of the movie, it suggests that "he will be back"

    In the future, the world has been taken over by SkyNet, a computer program that became sentient and launched a global nuclear holocaust. However a single man John Conner leads a human resistance that is on the verge of destroying SkyNet. SkyNet sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill the mother of John Conner. The resistance sends a soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to defend against the machine and save Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). This is director James Cameron's first baby, and he hit it out of the park. It is perfection that started the franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting really streamline the story. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He makes for the perfect machine. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It has the power of a much bigger film.

    The Terminator is a classic! Yes, I said a classic. Of the four movies so far this is my third favorite, behind the third and fourth movies. The graphics are just what you would expect from a movie that was made in the early 1980's. At the time the graphics were state of the art. However, today they are antiquated, which makes this a classic. The story was unique. Before 1984 there were scripts and plots that had robot that looked robotic, or monsters that looked like monsters. In 1984, James Cameron gave us The Terminator, a machine that can't be "bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead." The script revolves around Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who is the mother of John Connor, a future leader who fights and eventually defeats Skynet. Skynet developed technology to travel back in time in the hopes of killing Sarah Connor to prevent John Connor's birth. The human resistance sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save Sarah Connor and stop, if possible, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). As always I will list my three favorite scenes. As this movie has been around for nearly 30 years I have no issue in including any scene from the beginning to the end. The first scene I liked was when Sarah is in the nightclub waiting for the cops. She is being followed by Reese and the Terminator. When the Terminator walks by the table Sarah happens to drop something on the floor and bends over to pick it up. The Terminator eventually sees Sarah and moves in for the kill, but Reese intervenes. The second scene I liked was actually all of the flashback scenes for Reese. They were flashback scenes for Reese but would be flash-forwards for us. It gets a little confusing for when you talk about time travel. The third scene I liked was the final scene when Sarah defeats the Terminator. Reese is killed when he puts a pipe bomb in some of the Terminators gears. The resulting explosion kills Reese, cripples the Terminator, and injures Sarah. Sarah defeats the Terminator by crushing it. Before I finish this review I do have something to say. I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger. I give this 8 stars out of 10.

    The Terminator (James Cameron, 1984) It's easy to see how The Terminator put James Cameron on the map. Whether or not the story is entirely original (and of course, like maybe all sci-fi concepts, it's been done again and again, in the Doctor Who story Day of the Daleks just to name one example), the way Cameron put it all together is impressive. The storyline generates lots of genuine suspense, even when you know exactly what's going to happen, even when you know how it will happen. Linda Hamilton makes a great protagonist, her character arc developing quite believably given her performance. The special effects and the dialogue are sometimes a bit cheesy... but it was the Eighties, what can you do? The chase/fight scenes are not overdone (unlike certain newer movies like Man of Steel and Pacific Rim). The sequence of the police psychologist interviewing Reese provides some welcome comic relief, as do a couple of other sequences here and there. Arnold Schwarzenegger's questionable acting abilities are actually put to good advantage: he plays a believable robot. Overall I am pleased with The Terminator, which deserves its positive reputation as a force of pop culture. Solid piece of science fiction too. Sarah Connor was just damn lucky she was listed as the last Sarah Connor in the phone book! 9/10

    James Cameron (writer - director) at the time was known only by the awful trash movie "Piranha II". Hollywood not even knew his name (today when confirms a movie it already causes controversy, like start doing years later Tarantino) and when "Terminator" was announced none company was very interested in producing it. And when it came out it was not only a box office success but also became critically acclaimed and till today still considered an ultimate classic film. "The Terminator" was revolutionary for the time it came out, not only because it was made with a low budget and was extremely successful, but many at the time (and even today) consider the film only as a good action movie, but Cameron gave very more than that, the story of the film is something that had never been seen before. Everything begins with two successive murders that occurred in Los Angeles, both murders cause controversy and polemic because both victims had the same name, "Sarah Connor". The news reaches the ears of a third Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a beautiful and friendly waitress who begins to feel persecuted. After contacting the police from a nightclub, the Lieutenant Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) asks Sarah to wait for a police car to go pick her up. While waiting, Sarah is surprised by a huge man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who point a gun at her, but is surprised by a shot from Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who save Sarah's life (at least for a while). Sarah now finds herself in a frenetic chase for her life, but her mysterious savior has more secrets about Sarah that she can imagine and about the mysterious killer who proves to be a real killing machine called "Terminator 101". Nowadays this story (or derivatives of it) is used and reused becoming boring and clich&eacute;, but it was Cameron who started it all. The film is shown from the beginning as "a day like any other", by which I mean that Cameron delivers to the film a realistic narrative to their characters since swears; stupid teens just enjoying life; everyday language with playful insults; and also pop-cultural references since the shooting at the nightclub and to Sarah's friend, Ginger Ventura (Bess Motta) that never stop listen to music. Yeah, the film feels very realistic, but not only this that was revolutionary in Cameron film, but also delivers and evolves elements of sci  fi: time travel that had only been seen in "Back to the Future " with a good mood and fun style, here it is with a somber and violent tone; an apocalyptic world that was only seen in "Planet of the apes", also through humorous and philosophical tone, here with a scary tone. The film proceeds with a great narrative, but in management and technical aspects the film was shown really ahead of its time. Since the direction of the Cameron with terrific action scenes, also giving a frenetic and thrilling pace when the movie's chase becomes more violent and frightening. And also has an excellent visual direction from Cameron in flashbacks (or flash-ahead because we are talking about the future) in the apocalyptic future with machines reigning over us, all done with a model that served as help to Cameron later in "Titanic". A classic that will live forever in the history of cinema, thanks to a revolutionary and unique history, a fantastic direction, exceptional performance by Schwarzenegger putting him on the map, "The Terminator" revolutionized the action genre and sci-fi mixing both in this unforgettable masterpiece (yeah, James Cameron's masterpiece)! 10/10

    This is one of the most famous movie series in the world. I watched it first time,I regret that I never watched before. It was so exciting and deep story. Terminator is the robot which is a murderer to achieve one purpose. It is to kill a woman named Sara. She is a legendary character in the future.Her son achieved a great work however it was bad for the Terminator and decided to revenge against him and his mother. I've never seen like this so I felt a little fear at first however It's getting hotter and hotter I understood a meaning of story. And my impression point is the latest performance techniques in those days! It made me more exciting. I want to watch other series.

I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger. I give this 8 stars out of 10.

    The Terminator (James Cameron, 1984) It's easy to see how The Terminator put James Cameron on the map. Whether or not the story is entirely original (and of course, like maybe all sci-fi concepts, it's been done again and again, in the Doctor Who story Day of the Daleks just to name one example), the way Cameron put it all together is impressive. The storyline generates lots of genuine suspense, even when you know exactly what's going to happen, even when you know how it will happen. Linda Hamilton makes a great protagonist, her character arc developing quite believably given her performance. The special effects and the dialogue are sometimes a bit cheesy... but it was the Eighties, what can you do? The chase/fight scenes are not overdone (unlike certain newer movies like Man of Steel and Pacific Rim). The sequence of the police psychologist interviewing Reese provides some welcome comic relief, as do a couple of other sequences here and there. Arnold Schwarzenegger's questionable acting abilities are actually put to good advantage: he plays a believable robot. Overall I am pleased with The Terminator, which deserves its positive reputation as a force of pop culture. Solid piece of science fiction too. Sarah Connor was just damn lucky she was listed as the last Sarah Connor in the phone book! 9/10

    James Cameron (writer - director) at the time was known only by the awful trash movie "Piranha II". Hollywood not even knew his name (today when confirms a movie it already causes controversy, like start doing years later Tarantino) and when "Terminator" was announced none company was very interested in producing it. And when it came out it was not only a box office success but also became critically acclaimed and till today still considered an ultimate classic film. "The Terminator" was revolutionary for the time it came out, not only because it was made with a low budget and was extremely successful, but many at the time (and even today) consider the film only as a good action movie, but Cameron gave very more than that, the story of the film is something that had never been seen before. Everything begins with two successive murders that occurred in Los Angeles, both murders cause controversy and polemic because both victims had the same name, "Sarah Connor". The news reaches the ears of a third Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a beautiful and friendly waitress who begins to feel persecuted. After contacting the police from a nightclub, the Lieutenant Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) asks Sarah to wait for a police car to go pick her up. While waiting, Sarah is surprised by a huge man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who point a gun at her, but is surprised by a shot from Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who save Sarah's life (at least for a while). Sarah now finds herself in a frenetic chase for her life, but her mysterious savior has more secrets about Sarah that she can imagine and about the mysterious killer who proves to be a real killing machine called "Terminator 101". Nowadays this story (or derivatives of it) is used and reused becoming boring and clich&eacute;, but it was Cameron who started it all. The film is shown from the beginning as "a day like any other", by which I mean that Cameron delivers to the film a realistic narrative to their characters since swears; stupid teens just enjoying life; everyday language with playful insults; and also pop-cultural references since the shooting at the nightclub and to Sarah's friend, Ginger Ventura (Bess Motta) that never stop listen to music. Yeah, the film feels very realistic, but not only this that was revolutionary in Cameron film, but also delivers and evolves elements of sci  fi: time travel that had only been seen in "Back to the Future " with a good mood and fun style, here it is with a somber and violent tone; an apocalyptic world that was only seen in "Planet of the apes", also through humorous and philosophical tone, here with a scary tone. The film proceeds with a great narrative, but in management and technical aspects the film was shown really ahead of its time. Since the direction of the Cameron with terrific action scenes, also giving a frenetic and thrilling pace when the movie's chase becomes more violent and frightening. And also has an excellent visual direction from Cameron in flashbacks (or flash-ahead because we are talking about the future) in the apocalyptic future with machines reigning over us, all done with a model that served as help to Cameron later in "Titanic". A classic that will live forever in the history of cinema, thanks to a revolutionary and unique history, a fantastic direction, exceptional performance by Schwarzenegger putting him on the map, "The Terminator" revolutionized the action genre and sci-fi mixing both in this unforgettable masterpiece (yeah, James Cameron's masterpiece)! 10/10

    This is one of the most famous movie series in the world. I watched it first time,I regret that I never watched before. It was so exciting and deep story. Terminator is the robot which is a murderer to achieve one purpose. It is to kill a woman named Sara. She is a legendary character in the future.Her son achieved a great work however it was bad for the Terminator and decided to revenge against him and his mother. I've never seen like this so I felt a little fear at first however It's getting hotter and hotter I understood a meaning of story. And my impression point is the latest performance techniques in those days! It made me more exciting. I want to watch other series.

    If there is anyone who actually hasn't seen "The Terminator", I'll write my short opinion, because it was on TV last night and I just couldn't miss it. The plot is very simple... hero, villain, love story, cyborgs, post- apocalyptic futures ... you know, that old story. I won't bother with details, because I don't wanna spoil all the fun and fun is what you'll have if you like sci-fi, action and good old Arnie. The main protagonist is likable and relatable. The villain is awesome... hello?! Good old Ar.... you know already. The action is good, the excitement is there, the story is interesting enough, it wraps up movie nicely while still managing to prepare us for a great sequel (I really like part 2, that s*it is awesome). All the elements are there, so if you haven't... go for it.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger was dead-on perfect playing a cyborg assassin sent from the future by machines(who have enslaved humans) to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton, who has good character development here) who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance that will defeat the machines. Michael Bien plays a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah, but finds himself drawn to her as well. Time is a twisty road though, and the truth was not what either side thought it was... Outstanding film is extremely exciting and taut, with fine F/X, acting and script(not all the ideas are original, but they had never been put on screen so powerfully before.) Writer & director James Cameron made a name for himself with this breathless film, helped by a fantastic music score. A classic!

    The Terminator is easily one of the very best films ever made, in any genre. If i was to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island but could take 10 movies with me, quite probably this one would be on my list. Again, i'm not talking genre here; It's definitely one of the best SciFi/Action movies ever made, but it is also one of the best movies of all kinds ever made. But let's stay with the action side of it for a while though: The action in this flick is simply awesome. Mostly done without special effects and surely without CGI, The Terminator defines cinematic action. This is what celluloid and cameras were invented for. This is the stuff aspiring filmmakers study in order to learn the craft of filming action. There are of course films with more action, but the quality of it is paramount here. Everything feels true, not a false moment, no laughable exagerrations. Camera angles, editing rhythm, performances. All elements are perfect and make the action reach you. This is how it should be done, and the reason why you're at the edge of your seat though you have seen much "phatter", "cooler", "crasser" action in the decades since 1984. Let's have a look at the special effects now. I think the animatronics head shots are still absolutely valid today. The use of stop motion is totally visible, but those shots are not bad enough to catapult you out of the suspense. The model work is quite good most of the time, only some moments are a bit ludicrous. All in all, the effects are very watchable even in 2013 and far from being so bad that they would seriously impact the overall appeal of the film. The music is awesome. I always hate it when a score dictates too much, when it is too classical for a movie, when it is too in-your-face, when it drowns action and emotion in too many notes, melodies, sounds. Here, the score is unnoticeable most of the time, which is always a good thing. Droning eerily in the background, it lets your senses focus on the carnage on the screen and the terror in your mind but also pushes the pace forward with its thumping industrial beats. Then there is the main theme; not much more than a single, brilliant melody, but powerful enough to transcend themes of love, pain, premonition. And when it finally echoes in the love scene, you understand in a split second that this is actually Sarah's theme and the whole movie is actually tinted with her emotions. In the factory scene, the music drastically changes into a horrifying medley of dissonant screeches, making the shift into the third Act just as audible as scraping away the Terminators living tissue and showing us the metal chassis underneath is making it visible. There is not a single bad or even mediocre performance in this movie. All the actors are great, and i think Arnold does a hell of a job. Many people say he can't act but that he didn't need to here because he's playing a machine, so that it was alright. I think that's bullshit. Show me someone acting a machine and i show you someone looking real silly. *It's not that simple!* Arnold always knows what he does. He's a physical, agile actor, and perfect for the role, he makes you believe that this is a programmed killing machine, he makes the whole thing work. Biehn and Hamilton are at the top of their game and have a phenomenal chemistry. All the supporting actors do what they have to do perfectly. One reviewer commented that "the script is one that other screenwriters wished to have thought of first". Another added that it is one of those scripts that is being teached in screen writing seminars; both is true. Cameron and Hurd delivered their masterpiece here. The story is strong, original and meaningful. There are no weak moments, no plot holes. The motivations are strong and genuine, and all the main characters arch. The finale leaves us with a very confident resolution, strong emotions of both the positive and negative variety and is very, very satisfying. In fact, the more you look at the story, the better it becomes. Many people have criticized the time travel plot hole/paradox. But i think it all makes perfect sense: Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the "future". Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask "but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?". But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.

    The Terminator is a movie with a complex background that manages to deliver a simple yet strong story by staying true to the characters. Often times, films that deal with time travel tend to be confusing or full of holes, but The Terminator surprised me by developing a plot that was not only simple but emotional. The settings and mood throughout the entire movie really emphasize a state of panic, and it is definitely a thrilling experience from beginning to end. The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films. Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for. The Terminator takes viewers on a journey of constant fear, anxiety, and panic, and it's exactly because of this that The Terminator is a classic thriller.

    My favorite one! It is surprising for me that this is directed in 1982. Time traveling is an eternal dream of us and this movie depicts it so effectively. Terminator series' concept is the war between humans and machines. I was impressed by this that at time of 1982, how could the director anticipate the future of our society with machines! Now look at our daily life. Isn't our world getting close to the Terminator's world? We have to get in our mind the alert from this movie. The first one of the series is always the key of the whole story. At the end of the movie, it suggests that "he will be back"

    In the future, the world has been taken over by SkyNet, a computer program that became sentient and launched a global nuclear holocaust. However a single man John Conner leads a human resistance that is on the verge of destroying SkyNet. SkyNet sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill the mother of John Conner. The resistance sends a soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to defend against the machine and save Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). This is director James Cameron's first baby, and he hit it out of the park. It is perfection that started the franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting really streamline the story. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He makes for the perfect machine. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It has the power of a much bigger film.

    The Terminator is a classic! Yes, I said a classic. Of the four movies so far this is my third favorite, behind the third and fourth movies. The graphics are just what you would expect from a movie that was made in the early 1980's. At the time the graphics were state of the art. However, today they are antiquated, which makes this a classic. The story was unique. Before 1984 there were scripts and plots that had robot that looked robotic, or monsters that looked like monsters. In 1984, James Cameron gave us The Terminator, a machine that can't be "bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead." The script revolves around Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who is the mother of John Connor, a future leader who fights and eventually defeats Skynet. Skynet developed technology to travel back in time in the hopes of killing Sarah Connor to prevent John Connor's birth. The human resistance sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save Sarah Connor and stop, if possible, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). As always I will list my three favorite scenes. As this movie has been around for nearly 30 years I have no issue in including any scene from the beginning to the end. The first scene I liked was when Sarah is in the nightclub waiting for the cops. She is being followed by Reese and the Terminator. When the Terminator walks by the table Sarah happens to drop something on the floor and bends over to pick it up. The Terminator eventually sees Sarah and moves in for the kill, but Reese intervenes. The second scene I liked was actually all of the flashback scenes for Reese. They were flashback scenes for Reese but would be flash-forwards for us. It gets a little confusing for when you talk about time travel. The third scene I liked was the final scene when Sarah defeats the Terminator. Reese is killed when he puts a pipe bomb in some of the Terminators gears. The resulting explosion kills Reese, cripples the Terminator, and injures Sarah. Sarah defeats the Terminator by crushing it. Before I finish this review I do have something to say. I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger. I give this 8 stars out of 10.

But i think it all makes perfect sense: Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the "future". Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask "but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?". But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.

    The Terminator is a movie with a complex background that manages to deliver a simple yet strong story by staying true to the characters. Often times, films that deal with time travel tend to be confusing or full of holes, but The Terminator surprised me by developing a plot that was not only simple but emotional. The settings and mood throughout the entire movie really emphasize a state of panic, and it is definitely a thrilling experience from beginning to end. The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films. Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for. The Terminator takes viewers on a journey of constant fear, anxiety, and panic, and it's exactly because of this that The Terminator is a classic thriller.

    My favorite one! It is surprising for me that this is directed in 1982. Time traveling is an eternal dream of us and this movie depicts it so effectively. Terminator series' concept is the war between humans and machines. I was impressed by this that at time of 1982, how could the director anticipate the future of our society with machines! Now look at our daily life. Isn't our world getting close to the Terminator's world? We have to get in our mind the alert from this movie. The first one of the series is always the key of the whole story. At the end of the movie, it suggests that "he will be back"

    In the future, the world has been taken over by SkyNet, a computer program that became sentient and launched a global nuclear holocaust. However a single man John Conner leads a human resistance that is on the verge of destroying SkyNet. SkyNet sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill the mother of John Conner. The resistance sends a soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to defend against the machine and save Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). This is director James Cameron's first baby, and he hit it out of the park. It is perfection that started the franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting really streamline the story. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He makes for the perfect machine. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It has the power of a much bigger film.

    The Terminator is a classic! Yes, I said a classic. Of the four movies so far this is my third favorite, behind the third and fourth movies. The graphics are just what you would expect from a movie that was made in the early 1980's. At the time the graphics were state of the art. However, today they are antiquated, which makes this a classic. The story was unique. Before 1984 there were scripts and plots that had robot that looked robotic, or monsters that looked like monsters. In 1984, James Cameron gave us The Terminator, a machine that can't be "bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead." The script revolves around Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who is the mother of John Connor, a future leader who fights and eventually defeats Skynet. Skynet developed technology to travel back in time in the hopes of killing Sarah Connor to prevent John Connor's birth. The human resistance sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save Sarah Connor and stop, if possible, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). As always I will list my three favorite scenes. As this movie has been around for nearly 30 years I have no issue in including any scene from the beginning to the end. The first scene I liked was when Sarah is in the nightclub waiting for the cops. She is being followed by Reese and the Terminator. When the Terminator walks by the table Sarah happens to drop something on the floor and bends over to pick it up. The Terminator eventually sees Sarah and moves in for the kill, but Reese intervenes. The second scene I liked was actually all of the flashback scenes for Reese. They were flashback scenes for Reese but would be flash-forwards for us. It gets a little confusing for when you talk about time travel. The third scene I liked was the final scene when Sarah defeats the Terminator. Reese is killed when he puts a pipe bomb in some of the Terminators gears. The resulting explosion kills Reese, cripples the Terminator, and injures Sarah. Sarah defeats the Terminator by crushing it. Before I finish this review I do have something to say. I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger. I give this 8 stars out of 10.

    The Terminator (James Cameron, 1984) It's easy to see how The Terminator put James Cameron on the map. Whether or not the story is entirely original (and of course, like maybe all sci-fi concepts, it's been done again and again, in the Doctor Who story Day of the Daleks just to name one example), the way Cameron put it all together is impressive. The storyline generates lots of genuine suspense, even when you know exactly what's going to happen, even when you know how it will happen. Linda Hamilton makes a great protagonist, her character arc developing quite believably given her performance. The special effects and the dialogue are sometimes a bit cheesy... but it was the Eighties, what can you do? The chase/fight scenes are not overdone (unlike certain newer movies like Man of Steel and Pacific Rim). The sequence of the police psychologist interviewing Reese provides some welcome comic relief, as do a couple of other sequences here and there. Arnold Schwarzenegger's questionable acting abilities are actually put to good advantage: he plays a believable robot. Overall I am pleased with The Terminator, which deserves its positive reputation as a force of pop culture. Solid piece of science fiction too. Sarah Connor was just damn lucky she was listed as the last Sarah Connor in the phone book! 9/10

    James Cameron (writer - director) at the time was known only by the awful trash movie "Piranha II". Hollywood not even knew his name (today when confirms a movie it already causes controversy, like start doing years later Tarantino) and when "Terminator" was announced none company was very interested in producing it. And when it came out it was not only a box office success but also became critically acclaimed and till today still considered an ultimate classic film. "The Terminator" was revolutionary for the time it came out, not only because it was made with a low budget and was extremely successful, but many at the time (and even today) consider the film only as a good action movie, but Cameron gave very more than that, the story of the film is something that had never been seen before. Everything begins with two successive murders that occurred in Los Angeles, both murders cause controversy and polemic because both victims had the same name, "Sarah Connor". The news reaches the ears of a third Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a beautiful and friendly waitress who begins to feel persecuted. After contacting the police from a nightclub, the Lieutenant Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) asks Sarah to wait for a police car to go pick her up. While waiting, Sarah is surprised by a huge man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who point a gun at her, but is surprised by a shot from Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who save Sarah's life (at least for a while). Sarah now finds herself in a frenetic chase for her life, but her mysterious savior has more secrets about Sarah that she can imagine and about the mysterious killer who proves to be a real killing machine called "Terminator 101". Nowadays this story (or derivatives of it) is used and reused becoming boring and clich&eacute;, but it was Cameron who started it all. The film is shown from the beginning as "a day like any other", by which I mean that Cameron delivers to the film a realistic narrative to their characters since swears; stupid teens just enjoying life; everyday language with playful insults; and also pop-cultural references since the shooting at the nightclub and to Sarah's friend, Ginger Ventura (Bess Motta) that never stop listen to music. Yeah, the film feels very realistic, but not only this that was revolutionary in Cameron film, but also delivers and evolves elements of sci  fi: time travel that had only been seen in "Back to the Future " with a good mood and fun style, here it is with a somber and violent tone; an apocalyptic world that was only seen in "Planet of the apes", also through humorous and philosophical tone, here with a scary tone. The film proceeds with a great narrative, but in management and technical aspects the film was shown really ahead of its time. Since the direction of the Cameron with terrific action scenes, also giving a frenetic and thrilling pace when the movie's chase becomes more violent and frightening. And also has an excellent visual direction from Cameron in flashbacks (or flash-ahead because we are talking about the future) in the apocalyptic future with machines reigning over us, all done with a model that served as help to Cameron later in "Titanic". A classic that will live forever in the history of cinema, thanks to a revolutionary and unique history, a fantastic direction, exceptional performance by Schwarzenegger putting him on the map, "The Terminator" revolutionized the action genre and sci-fi mixing both in this unforgettable masterpiece (yeah, James Cameron's masterpiece)! 10/10

    This is one of the most famous movie series in the world. I watched it first time,I regret that I never watched before. It was so exciting and deep story. Terminator is the robot which is a murderer to achieve one purpose. It is to kill a woman named Sara. She is a legendary character in the future.Her son achieved a great work however it was bad for the Terminator and decided to revenge against him and his mother. I've never seen like this so I felt a little fear at first however It's getting hotter and hotter I understood a meaning of story. And my impression point is the latest performance techniques in those days! It made me more exciting. I want to watch other series.

    If there is anyone who actually hasn't seen "The Terminator", I'll write my short opinion, because it was on TV last night and I just couldn't miss it. The plot is very simple... hero, villain, love story, cyborgs, post- apocalyptic futures ... you know, that old story. I won't bother with details, because I don't wanna spoil all the fun and fun is what you'll have if you like sci-fi, action and good old Arnie. The main protagonist is likable and relatable. The villain is awesome... hello?! Good old Ar.... you know already. The action is good, the excitement is there, the story is interesting enough, it wraps up movie nicely while still managing to prepare us for a great sequel (I really like part 2, that s*it is awesome). All the elements are there, so if you haven't... go for it.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger was dead-on perfect playing a cyborg assassin sent from the future by machines(who have enslaved humans) to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton, who has good character development here) who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance that will defeat the machines. Michael Bien plays a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah, but finds himself drawn to her as well. Time is a twisty road though, and the truth was not what either side thought it was... Outstanding film is extremely exciting and taut, with fine F/X, acting and script(not all the ideas are original, but they had never been put on screen so powerfully before.) Writer & director James Cameron made a name for himself with this breathless film, helped by a fantastic music score. A classic!

    The Terminator is easily one of the very best films ever made, in any genre. If i was to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island but could take 10 movies with me, quite probably this one would be on my list. Again, i'm not talking genre here; It's definitely one of the best SciFi/Action movies ever made, but it is also one of the best movies of all kinds ever made. But let's stay with the action side of it for a while though: The action in this flick is simply awesome. Mostly done without special effects and surely without CGI, The Terminator defines cinematic action. This is what celluloid and cameras were invented for. This is the stuff aspiring filmmakers study in order to learn the craft of filming action. There are of course films with more action, but the quality of it is paramount here. Everything feels true, not a false moment, no laughable exagerrations. Camera angles, editing rhythm, performances. All elements are perfect and make the action reach you. This is how it should be done, and the reason why you're at the edge of your seat though you have seen much "phatter", "cooler", "crasser" action in the decades since 1984. Let's have a look at the special effects now. I think the animatronics head shots are still absolutely valid today. The use of stop motion is totally visible, but those shots are not bad enough to catapult you out of the suspense. The model work is quite good most of the time, only some moments are a bit ludicrous. All in all, the effects are very watchable even in 2013 and far from being so bad that they would seriously impact the overall appeal of the film. The music is awesome. I always hate it when a score dictates too much, when it is too classical for a movie, when it is too in-your-face, when it drowns action and emotion in too many notes, melodies, sounds. Here, the score is unnoticeable most of the time, which is always a good thing. Droning eerily in the background, it lets your senses focus on the carnage on the screen and the terror in your mind but also pushes the pace forward with its thumping industrial beats. Then there is the main theme; not much more than a single, brilliant melody, but powerful enough to transcend themes of love, pain, premonition. And when it finally echoes in the love scene, you understand in a split second that this is actually Sarah's theme and the whole movie is actually tinted with her emotions. In the factory scene, the music drastically changes into a horrifying medley of dissonant screeches, making the shift into the third Act just as audible as scraping away the Terminators living tissue and showing us the metal chassis underneath is making it visible. There is not a single bad or even mediocre performance in this movie. All the actors are great, and i think Arnold does a hell of a job. Many people say he can't act but that he didn't need to here because he's playing a machine, so that it was alright. I think that's bullshit. Show me someone acting a machine and i show you someone looking real silly. *It's not that simple!* Arnold always knows what he does. He's a physical, agile actor, and perfect for the role, he makes you believe that this is a programmed killing machine, he makes the whole thing work. Biehn and Hamilton are at the top of their game and have a phenomenal chemistry. All the supporting actors do what they have to do perfectly. One reviewer commented that "the script is one that other screenwriters wished to have thought of first". Another added that it is one of those scripts that is being teached in screen writing seminars; both is true. Cameron and Hurd delivered their masterpiece here. The story is strong, original and meaningful. There are no weak moments, no plot holes. The motivations are strong and genuine, and all the main characters arch. The finale leaves us with a very confident resolution, strong emotions of both the positive and negative variety and is very, very satisfying. In fact, the more you look at the story, the better it becomes. Many people have criticized the time travel plot hole/paradox. But i think it all makes perfect sense: Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the "future". Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask "but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?". But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.

    If there is anyone who actually hasn't seen "The Terminator", I'll write my short opinion, because it was on TV last night and I just couldn't miss it. The plot is very simple... hero, villain, love story, cyborgs, post- apocalyptic futures ... you know, that old story. I won't bother with details, because I don't wanna spoil all the fun and fun is what you'll have if you like sci-fi, action and good old Arnie. The main protagonist is likable and relatable. The villain is awesome... hello?! Good old Ar.... you know already. The action is good, the excitement is there, the story is interesting enough, it wraps up movie nicely while still managing to prepare us for a great sequel (I really like part 2, that s*it is awesome). All the elements are there, so if you haven't... go for it.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger was dead-on perfect playing a cyborg assassin sent from the future by machines(who have enslaved humans) to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton, who has good character development here) who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance that will defeat the machines. Michael Bien plays a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah, but finds himself drawn to her as well. Time is a twisty road though, and the truth was not what either side thought it was... Outstanding film is extremely exciting and taut, with fine F/X, acting and script(not all the ideas are original, but they had never been put on screen so powerfully before.) Writer & director James Cameron made a name for himself with this breathless film, helped by a fantastic music score. A classic!

    The Terminator is easily one of the very best films ever made, in any genre. If i was to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island but could take 10 movies with me, quite probably this one would be on my list. Again, i'm not talking genre here; It's definitely one of the best SciFi/Action movies ever made, but it is also one of the best movies of all kinds ever made. But let's stay with the action side of it for a while though: The action in this flick is simply awesome. Mostly done without special effects and surely without CGI, The Terminator defines cinematic action. This is what celluloid and cameras were invented for. This is the stuff aspiring filmmakers study in order to learn the craft of filming action. There are of course films with more action, but the quality of it is paramount here. Everything feels true, not a false moment, no laughable exagerrations. Camera angles, editing rhythm, performances. All elements are perfect and make the action reach you. This is how it should be done, and the reason why you're at the edge of your seat though you have seen much "phatter", "cooler", "crasser" action in the decades since 1984. Let's have a look at the special effects now. I think the animatronics head shots are still absolutely valid today. The use of stop motion is totally visible, but those shots are not bad enough to catapult you out of the suspense. The model work is quite good most of the time, only some moments are a bit ludicrous. All in all, the effects are very watchable even in 2013 and far from being so bad that they would seriously impact the overall appeal of the film. The music is awesome. I always hate it when a score dictates too much, when it is too classical for a movie, when it is too in-your-face, when it drowns action and emotion in too many notes, melodies, sounds. Here, the score is unnoticeable most of the time, which is always a good thing. Droning eerily in the background, it lets your senses focus on the carnage on the screen and the terror in your mind but also pushes the pace forward with its thumping industrial beats. Then there is the main theme; not much more than a single, brilliant melody, but powerful enough to transcend themes of love, pain, premonition. And when it finally echoes in the love scene, you understand in a split second that this is actually Sarah's theme and the whole movie is actually tinted with her emotions. In the factory scene, the music drastically changes into a horrifying medley of dissonant screeches, making the shift into the third Act just as audible as scraping away the Terminators living tissue and showing us the metal chassis underneath is making it visible. There is not a single bad or even mediocre performance in this movie. All the actors are great, and i think Arnold does a hell of a job. Many people say he can't act but that he didn't need to here because he's playing a machine, so that it was alright. I think that's bullshit. Show me someone acting a machine and i show you someone looking real silly. *It's not that simple!* Arnold always knows what he does. He's a physical, agile actor, and perfect for the role, he makes you believe that this is a programmed killing machine, he makes the whole thing work. Biehn and Hamilton are at the top of their game and have a phenomenal chemistry. All the supporting actors do what they have to do perfectly. One reviewer commented that "the script is one that other screenwriters wished to have thought of first". Another added that it is one of those scripts that is being teached in screen writing seminars; both is true. Cameron and Hurd delivered their masterpiece here. The story is strong, original and meaningful. There are no weak moments, no plot holes. The motivations are strong and genuine, and all the main characters arch. The finale leaves us with a very confident resolution, strong emotions of both the positive and negative variety and is very, very satisfying. In fact, the more you look at the story, the better it becomes. Many people have criticized the time travel plot hole/paradox. But i think it all makes perfect sense: Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the "future". Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask "but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?". But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.

    The Terminator is a movie with a complex background that manages to deliver a simple yet strong story by staying true to the characters. Often times, films that deal with time travel tend to be confusing or full of holes, but The Terminator surprised me by developing a plot that was not only simple but emotional. The settings and mood throughout the entire movie really emphasize a state of panic, and it is definitely a thrilling experience from beginning to end. The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films. Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for. The Terminator takes viewers on a journey of constant fear, anxiety, and panic, and it's exactly because of this that The Terminator is a classic thriller.

    My favorite one! It is surprising for me that this is directed in 1982. Time traveling is an eternal dream of us and this movie depicts it so effectively. Terminator series' concept is the war between humans and machines. I was impressed by this that at time of 1982, how could the director anticipate the future of our society with machines! Now look at our daily life. Isn't our world getting close to the Terminator's world? We have to get in our mind the alert from this movie. The first one of the series is always the key of the whole story. At the end of the movie, it suggests that "he will be back"

    In the future, the world has been taken over by SkyNet, a computer program that became sentient and launched a global nuclear holocaust. However a single man John Conner leads a human resistance that is on the verge of destroying SkyNet. SkyNet sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill the mother of John Conner. The resistance sends a soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to defend against the machine and save Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). This is director James Cameron's first baby, and he hit it out of the park. It is perfection that started the franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting really streamline the story. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He makes for the perfect machine. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It has the power of a much bigger film.

    The Terminator is a classic! Yes, I said a classic. Of the four movies so far this is my third favorite, behind the third and fourth movies. The graphics are just what you would expect from a movie that was made in the early 1980's. At the time the graphics were state of the art. However, today they are antiquated, which makes this a classic. The story was unique. Before 1984 there were scripts and plots that had robot that looked robotic, or monsters that looked like monsters. In 1984, James Cameron gave us The Terminator, a machine that can't be "bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead." The script revolves around Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who is the mother of John Connor, a future leader who fights and eventually defeats Skynet. Skynet developed technology to travel back in time in the hopes of killing Sarah Connor to prevent John Connor's birth. The human resistance sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save Sarah Connor and stop, if possible, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). As always I will list my three favorite scenes. As this movie has been around for nearly 30 years I have no issue in including any scene from the beginning to the end. The first scene I liked was when Sarah is in the nightclub waiting for the cops. She is being followed by Reese and the Terminator. When the Terminator walks by the table Sarah happens to drop something on the floor and bends over to pick it up. The Terminator eventually sees Sarah and moves in for the kill, but Reese intervenes. The second scene I liked was actually all of the flashback scenes for Reese. They were flashback scenes for Reese but would be flash-forwards for us. It gets a little confusing for when you talk about time travel. The third scene I liked was the final scene when Sarah defeats the Terminator. Reese is killed when he puts a pipe bomb in some of the Terminators gears. The resulting explosion kills Reese, cripples the Terminator, and injures Sarah. Sarah defeats the Terminator by crushing it. Before I finish this review I do have something to say. I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger. I give this 8 stars out of 10.

    The Terminator (James Cameron, 1984) It's easy to see how The Terminator put James Cameron on the map. Whether or not the story is entirely original (and of course, like maybe all sci-fi concepts, it's been done again and again, in the Doctor Who story Day of the Daleks just to name one example), the way Cameron put it all together is impressive. The storyline generates lots of genuine suspense, even when you know exactly what's going to happen, even when you know how it will happen. Linda Hamilton makes a great protagonist, her character arc developing quite believably given her performance. The special effects and the dialogue are sometimes a bit cheesy... but it was the Eighties, what can you do? The chase/fight scenes are not overdone (unlike certain newer movies like Man of Steel and Pacific Rim). The sequence of the police psychologist interviewing Reese provides some welcome comic relief, as do a couple of other sequences here and there. Arnold Schwarzenegger's questionable acting abilities are actually put to good advantage: he plays a believable robot. Overall I am pleased with The Terminator, which deserves its positive reputation as a force of pop culture. Solid piece of science fiction too. Sarah Connor was just damn lucky she was listed as the last Sarah Connor in the phone book! 9/10

    James Cameron (writer - director) at the time was known only by the awful trash movie "Piranha II". Hollywood not even knew his name (today when confirms a movie it already causes controversy, like start doing years later Tarantino) and when "Terminator" was announced none company was very interested in producing it. And when it came out it was not only a box office success but also became critically acclaimed and till today still considered an ultimate classic film. "The Terminator" was revolutionary for the time it came out, not only because it was made with a low budget and was extremely successful, but many at the time (and even today) consider the film only as a good action movie, but Cameron gave very more than that, the story of the film is something that had never been seen before. Everything begins with two successive murders that occurred in Los Angeles, both murders cause controversy and polemic because both victims had the same name, "Sarah Connor". The news reaches the ears of a third Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a beautiful and friendly waitress who begins to feel persecuted. After contacting the police from a nightclub, the Lieutenant Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) asks Sarah to wait for a police car to go pick her up. While waiting, Sarah is surprised by a huge man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who point a gun at her, but is surprised by a shot from Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who save Sarah's life (at least for a while). Sarah now finds herself in a frenetic chase for her life, but her mysterious savior has more secrets about Sarah that she can imagine and about the mysterious killer who proves to be a real killing machine called "Terminator 101". Nowadays this story (or derivatives of it) is used and reused becoming boring and clich&eacute;, but it was Cameron who started it all. The film is shown from the beginning as "a day like any other", by which I mean that Cameron delivers to the film a realistic narrative to their characters since swears; stupid teens just enjoying life; everyday language with playful insults; and also pop-cultural references since the shooting at the nightclub and to Sarah's friend, Ginger Ventura (Bess Motta) that never stop listen to music. Yeah, the film feels very realistic, but not only this that was revolutionary in Cameron film, but also delivers and evolves elements of sci  fi: time travel that had only been seen in "Back to the Future " with a good mood and fun style, here it is with a somber and violent tone; an apocalyptic world that was only seen in "Planet of the apes", also through humorous and philosophical tone, here with a scary tone. The film proceeds with a great narrative, but in management and technical aspects the film was shown really ahead of its time. Since the direction of the Cameron with terrific action scenes, also giving a frenetic and thrilling pace when the movie's chase becomes more violent and frightening. And also has an excellent visual direction from Cameron in flashbacks (or flash-ahead because we are talking about the future) in the apocalyptic future with machines reigning over us, all done with a model that served as help to Cameron later in "Titanic". A classic that will live forever in the history of cinema, thanks to a revolutionary and unique history, a fantastic direction, exceptional performance by Schwarzenegger putting him on the map, "The Terminator" revolutionized the action genre and sci-fi mixing both in this unforgettable masterpiece (yeah, James Cameron's masterpiece)! 10/10

    This is one of the most famous movie series in the world. I watched it first time,I regret that I never watched before. It was so exciting and deep story. Terminator is the robot which is a murderer to achieve one purpose. It is to kill a woman named Sara. She is a legendary character in the future.Her son achieved a great work however it was bad for the Terminator and decided to revenge against him and his mother. I've never seen like this so I felt a little fear at first however It's getting hotter and hotter I understood a meaning of story. And my impression point is the latest performance techniques in those days! It made me more exciting. I want to watch other series.

I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger. I give this 8 stars out of 10.

    The Terminator (James Cameron, 1984) It's easy to see how The Terminator put James Cameron on the map. Whether or not the story is entirely original (and of course, like maybe all sci-fi concepts, it's been done again and again, in the Doctor Who story Day of the Daleks just to name one example), the way Cameron put it all together is impressive. The storyline generates lots of genuine suspense, even when you know exactly what's going to happen, even when you know how it will happen. Linda Hamilton makes a great protagonist, her character arc developing quite believably given her performance. The special effects and the dialogue are sometimes a bit cheesy... but it was the Eighties, what can you do? The chase/fight scenes are not overdone (unlike certain newer movies like Man of Steel and Pacific Rim). The sequence of the police psychologist interviewing Reese provides some welcome comic relief, as do a couple of other sequences here and there. Arnold Schwarzenegger's questionable acting abilities are actually put to good advantage: he plays a believable robot. Overall I am pleased with The Terminator, which deserves its positive reputation as a force of pop culture. Solid piece of science fiction too. Sarah Connor was just damn lucky she was listed as the last Sarah Connor in the phone book! 9/10

    James Cameron (writer - director) at the time was known only by the awful trash movie "Piranha II". Hollywood not even knew his name (today when confirms a movie it already causes controversy, like start doing years later Tarantino) and when "Terminator" was announced none company was very interested in producing it. And when it came out it was not only a box office success but also became critically acclaimed and till today still considered an ultimate classic film. "The Terminator" was revolutionary for the time it came out, not only because it was made with a low budget and was extremely successful, but many at the time (and even today) consider the film only as a good action movie, but Cameron gave very more than that, the story of the film is something that had never been seen before. Everything begins with two successive murders that occurred in Los Angeles, both murders cause controversy and polemic because both victims had the same name, "Sarah Connor". The news reaches the ears of a third Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a beautiful and friendly waitress who begins to feel persecuted. After contacting the police from a nightclub, the Lieutenant Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) asks Sarah to wait for a police car to go pick her up. While waiting, Sarah is surprised by a huge man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who point a gun at her, but is surprised by a shot from Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who save Sarah's life (at least for a while). Sarah now finds herself in a frenetic chase for her life, but her mysterious savior has more secrets about Sarah that she can imagine and about the mysterious killer who proves to be a real killing machine called "Terminator 101". Nowadays this story (or derivatives of it) is used and reused becoming boring and clich&eacute;, but it was Cameron who started it all. The film is shown from the beginning as "a day like any other", by which I mean that Cameron delivers to the film a realistic narrative to their characters since swears; stupid teens just enjoying life; everyday language with playful insults; and also pop-cultural references since the shooting at the nightclub and to Sarah's friend, Ginger Ventura (Bess Motta) that never stop listen to music. Yeah, the film feels very realistic, but not only this that was revolutionary in Cameron film, but also delivers and evolves elements of sci  fi: time travel that had only been seen in "Back to the Future " with a good mood and fun style, here it is with a somber and violent tone; an apocalyptic world that was only seen in "Planet of the apes", also through humorous and philosophical tone, here with a scary tone. The film proceeds with a great narrative, but in management and technical aspects the film was shown really ahead of its time. Since the direction of the Cameron with terrific action scenes, also giving a frenetic and thrilling pace when the movie's chase becomes more violent and frightening. And also has an excellent visual direction from Cameron in flashbacks (or flash-ahead because we are talking about the future) in the apocalyptic future with machines reigning over us, all done with a model that served as help to Cameron later in "Titanic". A classic that will live forever in the history of cinema, thanks to a revolutionary and unique history, a fantastic direction, exceptional performance by Schwarzenegger putting him on the map, "The Terminator" revolutionized the action genre and sci-fi mixing both in this unforgettable masterpiece (yeah, James Cameron's masterpiece)! 10/10

    This is one of the most famous movie series in the world. I watched it first time,I regret that I never watched before. It was so exciting and deep story. Terminator is the robot which is a murderer to achieve one purpose. It is to kill a woman named Sara. She is a legendary character in the future.Her son achieved a great work however it was bad for the Terminator and decided to revenge against him and his mother. I've never seen like this so I felt a little fear at first however It's getting hotter and hotter I understood a meaning of story. And my impression point is the latest performance techniques in those days! It made me more exciting. I want to watch other series.

    If there is anyone who actually hasn't seen "The Terminator", I'll write my short opinion, because it was on TV last night and I just couldn't miss it. The plot is very simple... hero, villain, love story, cyborgs, post- apocalyptic futures ... you know, that old story. I won't bother with details, because I don't wanna spoil all the fun and fun is what you'll have if you like sci-fi, action and good old Arnie. The main protagonist is likable and relatable. The villain is awesome... hello?! Good old Ar.... you know already. The action is good, the excitement is there, the story is interesting enough, it wraps up movie nicely while still managing to prepare us for a great sequel (I really like part 2, that s*it is awesome). All the elements are there, so if you haven't... go for it.

    Arnold Schwarzenegger was dead-on perfect playing a cyborg assassin sent from the future by machines(who have enslaved humans) to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton, who has good character development here) who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance that will defeat the machines. Michael Bien plays a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah, but finds himself drawn to her as well. Time is a twisty road though, and the truth was not what either side thought it was... Outstanding film is extremely exciting and taut, with fine F/X, acting and script(not all the ideas are original, but they had never been put on screen so powerfully before.) Writer & director James Cameron made a name for himself with this breathless film, helped by a fantastic music score. A classic!

    The Terminator is easily one of the very best films ever made, in any genre. If i was to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island but could take 10 movies with me, quite probably this one would be on my list. Again, i'm not talking genre here; It's definitely one of the best SciFi/Action movies ever made, but it is also one of the best movies of all kinds ever made. But let's stay with the action side of it for a while though: The action in this flick is simply awesome. Mostly done without special effects and surely without CGI, The Terminator defines cinematic action. This is what celluloid and cameras were invented for. This is the stuff aspiring filmmakers study in order to learn the craft of filming action. There are of course films with more action, but the quality of it is paramount here. Everything feels true, not a false moment, no laughable exagerrations. Camera angles, editing rhythm, performances. All elements are perfect and make the action reach you. This is how it should be done, and the reason why you're at the edge of your seat though you have seen much "phatter", "cooler", "crasser" action in the decades since 1984. Let's have a look at the special effects now. I think the animatronics head shots are still absolutely valid today. The use of stop motion is totally visible, but those shots are not bad enough to catapult you out of the suspense. The model work is quite good most of the time, only some moments are a bit ludicrous. All in all, the effects are very watchable even in 2013 and far from being so bad that they would seriously impact the overall appeal of the film. The music is awesome. I always hate it when a score dictates too much, when it is too classical for a movie, when it is too in-your-face, when it drowns action and emotion in too many notes, melodies, sounds. Here, the score is unnoticeable most of the time, which is always a good thing. Droning eerily in the background, it lets your senses focus on the carnage on the screen and the terror in your mind but also pushes the pace forward with its thumping industrial beats. Then there is the main theme; not much more than a single, brilliant melody, but powerful enough to transcend themes of love, pain, premonition. And when it finally echoes in the love scene, you understand in a split second that this is actually Sarah's theme and the whole movie is actually tinted with her emotions. In the factory scene, the music drastically changes into a horrifying medley of dissonant screeches, making the shift into the third Act just as audible as scraping away the Terminators living tissue and showing us the metal chassis underneath is making it visible. There is not a single bad or even mediocre performance in this movie. All the actors are great, and i think Arnold does a hell of a job. Many people say he can't act but that he didn't need to here because he's playing a machine, so that it was alright. I think that's bullshit. Show me someone acting a machine and i show you someone looking real silly. *It's not that simple!* Arnold always knows what he does. He's a physical, agile actor, and perfect for the role, he makes you believe that this is a programmed killing machine, he makes the whole thing work. Biehn and Hamilton are at the top of their game and have a phenomenal chemistry. All the supporting actors do what they have to do perfectly. One reviewer commented that "the script is one that other screenwriters wished to have thought of first". Another added that it is one of those scripts that is being teached in screen writing seminars; both is true. Cameron and Hurd delivered their masterpiece here. The story is strong, original and meaningful. There are no weak moments, no plot holes. The motivations are strong and genuine, and all the main characters arch. The finale leaves us with a very confident resolution, strong emotions of both the positive and negative variety and is very, very satisfying. In fact, the more you look at the story, the better it becomes. Many people have criticized the time travel plot hole/paradox. But i think it all makes perfect sense: Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the "future". Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask "but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?". But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.

    The Terminator is a movie with a complex background that manages to deliver a simple yet strong story by staying true to the characters. Often times, films that deal with time travel tend to be confusing or full of holes, but The Terminator surprised me by developing a plot that was not only simple but emotional. The settings and mood throughout the entire movie really emphasize a state of panic, and it is definitely a thrilling experience from beginning to end. The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films. Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for. The Terminator takes viewers on a journey of constant fear, anxiety, and panic, and it's exactly because of this that The Terminator is a classic thriller.

    My favorite one! It is surprising for me that this is directed in 1982. Time traveling is an eternal dream of us and this movie depicts it so effectively. Terminator series' concept is the war between humans and machines. I was impressed by this that at time of 1982, how could the director anticipate the future of our society with machines! Now look at our daily life. Isn't our world getting close to the Terminator's world? We have to get in our mind the alert from this movie. The first one of the series is always the key of the whole story. At the end of the movie, it suggests that "he will be back"

    In the future, the world has been taken over by SkyNet, a computer program that became sentient and launched a global nuclear holocaust. However a single man John Conner leads a human resistance that is on the verge of destroying SkyNet. SkyNet sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill the mother of John Conner. The resistance sends a soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to defend against the machine and save Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). This is director James Cameron's first baby, and he hit it out of the park. It is perfection that started the franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting really streamline the story. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He makes for the perfect machine. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It has the power of a much bigger film.

    The Terminator is a classic! Yes, I said a classic. Of the four movies so far this is my third favorite, behind the third and fourth movies. The graphics are just what you would expect from a movie that was made in the early 1980's. At the time the graphics were state of the art. However, today they are antiquated, which makes this a classic. The story was unique. Before 1984 there were scripts and plots that had robot that looked robotic, or monsters that looked like monsters. In 1984, James Cameron gave us The Terminator, a machine that can't be "bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead." The script revolves around Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who is the mother of John Connor, a future leader who fights and eventually defeats Skynet. Skynet developed technology to travel back in time in the hopes of killing Sarah Connor to prevent John Connor's birth. The human resistance sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save Sarah Connor and stop, if possible, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). As always I will list my three favorite scenes. As this movie has been around for nearly 30 years I have no issue in including any scene from the beginning to the end. The first scene I liked was when Sarah is in the nightclub waiting for the cops. She is being followed by Reese and the Terminator. When the Terminator walks by the table Sarah happens to drop something on the floor and bends over to pick it up. The Terminator eventually sees Sarah and moves in for the kill, but Reese intervenes. The second scene I liked was actually all of the flashback scenes for Reese. They were flashback scenes for Reese but would be flash-forwards for us. It gets a little confusing for when you talk about time travel. The third scene I liked was the final scene when Sarah defeats the Terminator. Reese is killed when he puts a pipe bomb in some of the Terminators gears. The resulting explosion kills Reese, cripples the Terminator, and injures Sarah. Sarah defeats the Terminator by crushing it. Before I finish this review I do have something to say. I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger. I give this 8 stars out of 10.

But i think it all makes perfect sense: Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the "future". Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask "but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?". But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination.

    The Terminator is a movie with a complex background that manages to deliver a simple yet strong story by staying true to the characters. Often times, films that deal with time travel tend to be confusing or full of holes, but The Terminator surprised me by developing a plot that was not only simple but emotional. The settings and mood throughout the entire movie really emphasize a state of panic, and it is definitely a thrilling experience from beginning to end. The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films. Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for. The Terminator takes viewers on a journey of constant fear, anxiety, and panic, and it's exactly because of this that The Terminator is a classic thriller.
