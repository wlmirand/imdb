 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Andrew Beckett, a gay lawyer infected with AIDS, is fired from his conservative law firm in fear that they might contract AIDS from him. After Andrew is fired, in a last attempt for peace, he sues his former law firm with the help of a homophobic lawyer, Joe Miller.

    The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it. A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible. The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination. The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions. The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it. The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script. This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people. And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993. In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals. Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human. Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them. As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew. I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that. It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark. The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music. While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

    I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.

    If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding. And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life. These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people. And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".

    Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination. The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does. The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown. The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death. The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.

    A movie which started out for me as a Tom Hanks winner gave me much much more. Denzel Washington was in his comfortable best dishing out the dialogues he has epitomized in Hollywood. This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across. Direction, screenplay all were just correct. In a normal motion picture, it was a strong message!

    Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****

    Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier. Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality. The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease. The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience. Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.

    I wasn't as blown away as many reviewers seem to be. The characters are stereotypes of different kinds of people we see in the World. The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures. The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death. The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time. Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.

    Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction. It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.

    The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it. A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible. The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination. The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions. The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it. The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script. This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people. And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993. In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals. Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human. Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them. As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew. I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that. It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark. The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music. While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

    I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.

    If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding. And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life. These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people. And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".

    Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination. The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does. The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown. The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death. The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.

    A movie which started out for me as a Tom Hanks winner gave me much much more. Denzel Washington was in his comfortable best dishing out the dialogues he has epitomized in Hollywood. This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across. Direction, screenplay all were just correct. In a normal motion picture, it was a strong message!

    Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****

    Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier. Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality. The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease. The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience. Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.

    I wasn't as blown away as many reviewers seem to be. The characters are stereotypes of different kinds of people we see in the World. The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures. The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death. The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time. Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.

    Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction. It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.

    The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it. A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible. The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination. The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions. The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it. The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script. This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people. And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993. In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals. Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human. Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them. As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew. I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that. It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark. The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music. While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

    I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.

    If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding. And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life. These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people. And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".

    Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination. The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does. The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown. The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death. The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.

    A movie which started out for me as a Tom Hanks winner gave me much much more. Denzel Washington was in his comfortable best dishing out the dialogues he has epitomized in Hollywood. This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across. Direction, screenplay all were just correct. In a normal motion picture, it was a strong message!

    Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****

    Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier. Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality. The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease. The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience. Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.

    I wasn't as blown away as many reviewers seem to be. The characters are stereotypes of different kinds of people we see in the World. The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures. The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death. The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time. Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.

    Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction. It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.

    The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it. A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible. The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination. The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions. The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it. The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script. This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people. And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993. In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals. Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human. Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them. As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew. I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that. It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark. The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music. While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

    I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.

    If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding. And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life. These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people. And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".

    Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination. The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does. The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown. The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death. The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.

    A movie which started out for me as a Tom Hanks winner gave me much much more. Denzel Washington was in his comfortable best dishing out the dialogues he has epitomized in Hollywood. This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across. Direction, screenplay all were just correct. In a normal motion picture, it was a strong message!

    Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****

    Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier. Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality. The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease. The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience. Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.

    I wasn't as blown away as many reviewers seem to be. The characters are stereotypes of different kinds of people we see in the World. The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures. The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death. The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time. Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.

    Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction. It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.

    The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it. A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible. The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination. The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions. The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it. The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script. This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people. And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993. In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals. Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human. Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them. As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew. I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that. It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark. The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music. While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

    I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.

    If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding. And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life. These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people. And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".

    Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination. The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does. The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown. The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death. The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.

    A movie which started out for me as a Tom Hanks winner gave me much much more. Denzel Washington was in his comfortable best dishing out the dialogues he has epitomized in Hollywood. This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across. Direction, screenplay all were just correct. In a normal motion picture, it was a strong message!

    Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****

    Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier. Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality. The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease. The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience. Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.

    I wasn't as blown away as many reviewers seem to be. The characters are stereotypes of different kinds of people we see in the World. The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures. The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death. The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time. Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.

    Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction. It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.

    The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it. A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible. The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination. The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions. The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it. The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script. This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people. And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993. In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals. Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human. Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them. As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew. I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that. It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark. The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music. While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

    I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.

    If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding. And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life. These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people. And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".

    Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination. The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does. The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown. The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death. The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.

    A movie which started out for me as a Tom Hanks winner gave me much much more. Denzel Washington was in his comfortable best dishing out the dialogues he has epitomized in Hollywood. This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across. Direction, screenplay all were just correct. In a normal motion picture, it was a strong message!

    Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****

    Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier. Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality. The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease. The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience. Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.

    I wasn't as blown away as many reviewers seem to be. The characters are stereotypes of different kinds of people we see in the World. The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures. The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death. The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time. Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.

    Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction. It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.

    The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it. A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible. The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination. The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions. The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it. The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script. This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people. And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993. In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals. Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human. Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them. As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew. I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that. It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark. The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music. While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

    I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.

    If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding. And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life. These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people. And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".

    Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination. The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does. The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown. The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death. The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.

    A movie which started out for me as a Tom Hanks winner gave me much much more. Denzel Washington was in his comfortable best dishing out the dialogues he has epitomized in Hollywood. This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across. Direction, screenplay all were just correct. In a normal motion picture, it was a strong message!

    Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****

    Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier. Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality. The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease. The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience. Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.

    I wasn't as blown away as many reviewers seem to be. The characters are stereotypes of different kinds of people we see in the World. The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures. The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death. The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time. Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.

    Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction. It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.

    The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it. A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible. The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination. The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions. The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it. The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script. This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people. And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993. In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals. Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human. Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them. As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew. I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that. It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark. The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music. While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

    I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.

    If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding. And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life. These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people. And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".

    Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination. The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does. The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown. The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death. The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.

    A movie which started out for me as a Tom Hanks winner gave me much much more. Denzel Washington was in his comfortable best dishing out the dialogues he has epitomized in Hollywood. This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across. Direction, screenplay all were just correct. In a normal motion picture, it was a strong message!

    Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****

    Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier. Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality. The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease. The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience. Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.

    I wasn't as blown away as many reviewers seem to be. The characters are stereotypes of different kinds of people we see in the World. The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures. The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death. The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time. Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.

    Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction. It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.

    The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it. A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible. The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination. The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions. The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it. The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script. This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people. And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993. In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals. Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human. Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them. As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew. I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that. It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark. The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music. While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

    I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.

    If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding. And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life. These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people. And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".

    Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination. The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does. The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown. The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death. The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.

    A movie which started out for me as a Tom Hanks winner gave me much much more. Denzel Washington was in his comfortable best dishing out the dialogues he has epitomized in Hollywood. This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across. Direction, screenplay all were just correct. In a normal motion picture, it was a strong message!

    Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****

    Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier. Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality. The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease. The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience. Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.

    I wasn't as blown away as many reviewers seem to be. The characters are stereotypes of different kinds of people we see in the World. The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures. The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death. The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time. Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.

    Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction. It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.

    The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it. A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible. The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination. The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions. The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it. The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script. This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people. And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word  no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993. In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals. Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human. Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them. As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew. I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that. It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change  sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark. The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale  yes, I cried"Goodnight. See you tomorrow" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music. While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild  I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.

    I just finished watching Philadelphia and I must say that this is a great and well made movie. The choice of actors was spot on. I was able to grow with each and began to empathize with them as the movie progressed. This movie made me cry and reminded me of my cousin who died from AIDs. While the times have changed since this movie was made, the theme and values it teaches are to be good to others and give people a fair chance regardless of what you may know of them. The literary devices used in this movie were great and enveloped me in their carefully written portraits. I would recommend this movie and hope that people continue to watch and celebrate its concept.

    If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding. And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life. These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people. And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".

    Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination. The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does. The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown. The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death. The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.

    A movie which started out for me as a Tom Hanks winner gave me much much more. Denzel Washington was in his comfortable best dishing out the dialogues he has epitomized in Hollywood. This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across. Direction, screenplay all were just correct. In a normal motion picture, it was a strong message!

    Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****

    Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier. Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality. The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease. The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience. Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.

    I wasn't as blown away as many reviewers seem to be. The characters are stereotypes of different kinds of people we see in the World. The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures. The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death. The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time. Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.

    Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker & McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction. It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.
