 <sinopse>
  A soldier convicted for murdering his commanding officer is dumped and left to die on a prison island inhabited by two camps of convicts.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Robbins is sentenced to prison for the assassination of his general officer, a prison you leave only when you die. Since nobody ever leaves the prison, nobody knows what the prison is like. The prison manager realizes this and buys himself an island playground called "Absolom," where the worst prisoners are free to create an isolated barbaric society, and where the strongest men rule...a living hell. Robbins is sent to Absolom after he almost kills the prison manager.

    This is a semi-expensive Film with a B-Movie feel and it is better for it. The slickness is not done in an in your face manner as it just unfolds unpretentiously and is beautiful to behold. The costumes are also quite "attractive" and proudly display their "freak flags" high. The story is somewhat simple and yet some of the complexities and Philosophy about corporate prisons and civilized society are lost in the action and some less than adequate script involvement. But not enough to keep this from being enjoyable escapism. There are some well done, violent battles and some witticisms that are quite amusing. The villain is venomous and quite the psychopathic comedian. In all, this is quite entertaining stuff that never pretends to be more than it is. A kind of throw-back to Matin&eacute;e fare of a by-gone era.

    In the not-too-distant future, Robbins is sent to prison for killing his superior. The corporately (and corruptly) run prison causes Robbins to rebel against the Warden. His rebellion only gets him sent to the most maximum security facility there is - Absolom. The worst hardcore criminals are just dumped onto the island Absolom to live or die as they can. The island is patrolled by heavily armed helicopters and fenced by impenetrable sea defences. Two different societies have formed over the years; an evil 'empire' run by Walter Marek that is conflicting with the other, more pacific, group run by The Father. Resources are kept scarce by the warden as a game to keep the population down by destroying themselves. Who will our hardcore Captain fit in with the best..... This is one of those lost movies that crops up late at night on TV and you have forgotten just how fantastically cheesy it is. Liotta is perfect as the soldier, as he has the balance of 'good' guy and psycho about right. The film is a great vehicle for him. Wilson is good as Merek, but he's doing the same schtick as he did in Lethal 3, and though it's perfectly fine, he gets a little to Alan Rickman toward the end. Ina role reversal, Henrikson plays the placid father, which, for anyone who knows the actor is quite a good in joke, as he always plays the bad @ss. The narrative is great, and the set pieces and sets are great for such a low budget. So if you do catch this film, remember, Liotta is fantastic, It debuted at number 1 at the US box office, and it has the best gun ever in film

    To simply describe this movie, it is a version of Lord of the Flies. The idea is that isolated from civilisation, people become like animals. This is partially true in this movie but moreso it seems to fall apart when we see one group of people who are developing their own civilisation. Still, this is similar to Lord of the Flies were one group became savage and hostile, while the others tried to become more civilised. This movie, though, is based on another book: The Penal Colony by Richard Herley and supposedly it is supposed to be a critique on the prison system. In the film, the prisons are supposed to be money making corporations where prisoners assigned there are reduced to slave labour. Basically there is a hierarchy, and the island Absolom is at the top. Prisoners who prove to be too troublesome to turn into slave labourers are banished to the island and are left to fend for themselves. The prison is nice to drop in small amounts of food, but most of the time the inhabitants must scrounge for themselves. If this is supposed to be a critique on the prison system, there seems to be a huge lack of it. What I saw in this movie was a treatise on the savagery of humanity, and the warden is actively trying to encourage the savagery. If they are civilised then they might turn against him, so if they are busy fighting, then all the better. The weird thing I noticed, is that the warden personally came to the island to deal with the problem. Thus he was sticking his neck out in a way that was purely illogical. It seemed to be an excuse to get him there to kill him.

    Martin Campbell ("Goldeneye", "Casino Royal"), a seasoned hand at action movies, directs "No Escape" (aka "Escape from Absolom"). Set in a dystopian future, the film sees actor Ray Liotta imprisoned on a high security island inhabited by gangs of sociopaths and criminals. As he is a well trained American Marine, Liotta uses his violent skills to stay alive, rally men against evil hordes and seek vengeance on the men who imprisoned him. The film's plot is clich&eacute;d (its "Predator" meets "Escape from Alcatraz" meets "Lord of the Flies"), but it has some good set design, action sequences and firmly realises it's but a glorified B movie. Bizarrely, "No Escape" seems to have vaguely predicted the 2011 Libyan conflict. Situated before "The Hunger Games", "Gamer" and "Battle Royale" and after "The Running Man", "Roller Ball" and "Death Race", "Escape from New York", "Beyond Thunderdome", it also continues a trend of caging people and then making them fight, like Gladiators, for salacious audiences. 7.5/10  Worth one viewing.

    There was a spate of movies which centred around people wrongly banged up in escape-proof prisons in some sort of alternate reality quasi-sci-fi setting. In this case, the prison is on an island, and those sent there have split into two groups. One group, the goodies, simply wants to mind its own business and get on with the job of surviving. The other group, the baddies, is savage and warlike and wants to persecute / steal from - wipe out the first group. Shenanigans ensue. This is tosh, but entertaining tosh. Production values are high, there is loads of action, decent performances from a high profile case, treachery when you least expect it from someone from whom you least expect it (or perhaps you do), a performance of eye-rolling pantomime villainy from Stuart Wilson, and satisfying payoffs when you want them. Good fun.

    decent flick. Definitely better than i thought it would be. however there is one moment in the film that supremely creeped me out. There's a moment where the prison warden is reading the rap sheet of capt. Robbins (Ray Liotta), that includes some of his special forces history. He reads off saying something like "oh so you were in Libya Behngazi, in 2011?" Very creepy for a movie made in 94, given whats gone in in Libya, Behngazi and that its happened in 2011. Also the fact that like Capt. Robbins, in in the American special forces, recently 6 soldiers working for British special forces were captured and deported in Behngazi Libya. That was the biggest WTF moment in the movie for me lol. Overall though not a bad flick. Would have been disappointed if I dropped a few bucks on it in theatres, but i saw it cheaply in netflix and it was worth it. check it out!

    Take some pretty good actors, Ray Liotta, Stuart Wilson, Lance Henrekson, Michael Lerner, among others, and put them in an exciting no escape prison situation. That along with a script that keeps the high level of excitement going for a full 118 minutes, and you have a winning combination. Special mention must be made of the excellent Australian location, and the great sets and costumes. Ray Liotta is thrown into the middle of two warring factions, while his only objective is to escape from Michael Lerner's futuristic island prison. Zero women, zero romantic distractions, "No Escape" is 100% action, and exceeds expectations. - MERK

    It's 2022 and Captain John Robbins is convicted of murder and sent to a maximum security prison. Refusing to accept the brutal regime, Robbins rebels and promptly gets sent to a secret place where only the toughest can survive. Absolom, a jungle island inhabited by two groups, The Outsiders and The Insiders. Will John pick a side,? or will he merely go it alone, carrying his anger along the way?. Directed by Martin Campbell {Goldeneye/Casino Royale} and starring Ray Liotta {Robbins}, Lance Henriksen, Kevin Dillon, Ernie Hudson and Stuart Wilson. No Escape is adapted from the novel written by Richard Herley. Naturally it's all complete nonsense, and it for sure feels like a blending of all the other prison/sci-fi/apocalyptic films that have come our way over the years {think Mad Max in Alcatraz type thing}. But it has such an adventurous fun about it, the familiarity of it all is quickly forgotten. The cast appear to be having a great time, Liotta looks like, and acts like he's the hardest man on the planet, Henriksen is smooth in a peaceful role, while Stuart Wilson is revelling in bad guy duties. Campbell knows how to direct action sequences, and here he delivers well within the relatively small budget {it was shot on location in parts of Australia}. For those inclined it's suitably violent, while the story and vision of the future itself is certainly of interest to the discerning sci-fi fan. Not one to remotely take serious of course, but check the brain in at the door and run with it. Because then you may just enjoy its trashy splendour. 6/10

    With the future of basic employment being harness to either robotics or Private businesses, it's little wonder we have a movie which purports to predict what prisons are going to look like in the future. This futuristic film leaves little doubt that if a private warden takes the helm of one of these prisons, things are apt to get out of hand. From an audiences' perspective, we can expect a lot from whomever Hollywood chooses as their main star. In this offering, we have impressive Ray Liotta as Capt. J.T. Robbins, a disgraced Special Forces soldier, who's been court martialed and sent to prison for the murder of his commanding officer. However, the Warden of the prison (Michael Lerner, who is almost believably sadistic) decides to ratchet up his punishment by sending him to ' Absolom' a maximum island prison where life is shortened by the extreme brutality allowed. Here Robbins, meets Walter Marek, a brutal prisoner who leads his 'outsiders' with savage force and who tries to force Robbins to submit to his authority which leads to their jungle confrontation. Robbins also meets 'The Father' (Lance Henriksen) the leader of other convicts living apart in a special compound and who've accepted their punishment, but wish to do their time in peace and companionship. Ernie Hudson plays Hawkins, the security officer for their compound. The action/drama is slow to build, but explodes when it does. Plenty of mayhem follows and through some of the sub-plots a forceful and violent movie appears. A good film for Liotta and Hadson and it's ending is surprisingly unexpected. ****

    Ah, the glorious early nineties! Back when big stars were still appearing in incredibly violent action movies and when over-anxious kids like myself had to secretly sneak into cinemas because you weren't allowed to see these movies under the age of 16. "Escape from Absolom" is a childhood favorite of mine, so my views and opinions may be a bit biased, but still I think they don't make action flicks like this one anymore nowadays. The script may perhaps contain a few gigantic holes and completely illogic twists, but at least it's continuously fast-paced, politically incorrect and spectacular. The year's 2022 and prisons have turned into private companies without government interference. Absolom is the name of a prison colony island where the sadistic warden (Michael Lerner) plays off the Outsiders against the Insiders. The former are an unorganized bunch of savages wearing masks and hunting with primitive weapons, led by the relentless but charismatic Walter Marek. The Insiders, however, attempted to found a peaceful community where they grow crops and seek for moral redemption. The newly arrived and military trained prisoner Robbins would make a great asset for the Insiders, since he's the only one to have ever escaped from the Outsiders, but he's stubborn and anti-social and solely intends to get off the island alone. The concept of "Escape from Absolom" is very reminiscent to copious other (futuristic) prison movies, like "Fortress", "Papillon", "Blood Camp Thatcher", "Escape from NY" , but this one definitely benefices from good production values, staggering filming locations, a devoted cast and the professional direction of Martin Campbell. The battle sequences as well as the violent ordeals Robbins meets in the Outsiders' camp are robust and grisly, including a lot of decapitations and swashbuckling. The high tempo and adrenalin-level is only occasionally overshadowed by overly sentimental biographies and redundant flashbacks. Obviously in a prison colony, everybody has a story to tell about why he ended up there and the film tells too many of them. Ray Liotta's character is an interesting anti-hero, since he remains unreliable and somewhat aloof. The most fascinating character is undoubtedly Walter Merak. He's an insane and power-obsessed dictator with menacing facial expressions and a deranged sense of humor. Merak also narrates R-rated versions of Goldilocks and the Three Bears and eliminates the members of his own "parliament" to gain even more power. It's a stupendous performance from Stuart Wilson; an actor whose other works I'm not really familiar with. The always reliable Lance Henriksen, Ernie Hudson, Kevin J. O'Connor and Ian McNeice deliver awesome roles in the supportive cast. Granted, the movie is far from flawless and the sudden ending is a bit stupid and implausible, but "Escape from Absolom" nevertheless remains one of the highlights of early 90's Sci-Fi/action cinema.

    Ah, the glorious early nineties! Back when big stars were still appearing in incredibly violent action movies and when over-anxious kids like myself had to secretly sneak into cinemas because you weren't allowed to see these movies under the age of 16. "Escape from Absolom" is a childhood favorite of mine, so my views and opinions may be a bit biased, but still I think they don't make action flicks like this one anymore nowadays. The script may perhaps contain a few gigantic holes and completely illogic twists, but at least it's continuously fast-paced, politically incorrect and spectacular. The year's 2022 and prisons have turned into private companies without government interference. Absolom is the name of a prison colony island where the sadistic warden (Michael Lerner) plays off the Outsiders against the Insiders. The former are an unorganized bunch of savages wearing masks and hunting with primitive weapons, led by the relentless but charismatic Walter Marek. The Insiders, however, attempted to found a peaceful community where they grow crops and seek for moral redemption. The newly arrived and military trained prisoner Robbins would make a great asset for the Insiders, since he's the only one to have ever escaped from the Outsiders, but he's stubborn and anti-social and solely intends to get off the island alone. The concept of "Escape from Absolom" is very reminiscent to copious other (futuristic) prison movies, like "Fortress", "Papillon", "Blood Camp Thatcher", "Escape from NY" , but this one definitely benefices from good production values, staggering filming locations, a devoted cast and the professional direction of Martin Campbell. The battle sequences as well as the violent ordeals Robbins meets in the Outsiders' camp are robust and grisly, including a lot of decapitations and swashbuckling. The high tempo and adrenalin-level is only occasionally overshadowed by overly sentimental biographies and redundant flashbacks. Obviously in a prison colony, everybody has a story to tell about why he ended up there and the film tells too many of them. Ray Liotta's character is an interesting anti-hero, since he remains unreliable and somewhat aloof. The most fascinating character is undoubtedly Walter Merak. He's an insane and power-obsessed dictator with menacing facial expressions and a deranged sense of humor. Merak also narrates R-rated versions of Goldilocks and the Three Bears and eliminates the members of his own "parliament" to gain even more power. It's a stupendous performance from Stuart Wilson; an actor whose other works I'm not really familiar with. The always reliable Lance Henriksen, Ernie Hudson, Kevin J. O'Connor and Ian McNeice deliver awesome roles in the supportive cast. Granted, the movie is far from flawless and the sudden ending is a bit stupid and implausible, but "Escape from Absolom" nevertheless remains one of the highlights of early 90's Sci-Fi/action cinema.

    This is a semi-expensive Film with a B-Movie feel and it is better for it. The slickness is not done in an in your face manner as it just unfolds unpretentiously and is beautiful to behold. The costumes are also quite "attractive" and proudly display their "freak flags" high. The story is somewhat simple and yet some of the complexities and Philosophy about corporate prisons and civilized society are lost in the action and some less than adequate script involvement. But not enough to keep this from being enjoyable escapism. There are some well done, violent battles and some witticisms that are quite amusing. The villain is venomous and quite the psychopathic comedian. In all, this is quite entertaining stuff that never pretends to be more than it is. A kind of throw-back to Matin&eacute;e fare of a by-gone era.

    In the not-too-distant future, Robbins is sent to prison for killing his superior. The corporately (and corruptly) run prison causes Robbins to rebel against the Warden. His rebellion only gets him sent to the most maximum security facility there is - Absolom. The worst hardcore criminals are just dumped onto the island Absolom to live or die as they can. The island is patrolled by heavily armed helicopters and fenced by impenetrable sea defences. Two different societies have formed over the years; an evil 'empire' run by Walter Marek that is conflicting with the other, more pacific, group run by The Father. Resources are kept scarce by the warden as a game to keep the population down by destroying themselves. Who will our hardcore Captain fit in with the best..... This is one of those lost movies that crops up late at night on TV and you have forgotten just how fantastically cheesy it is. Liotta is perfect as the soldier, as he has the balance of 'good' guy and psycho about right. The film is a great vehicle for him. Wilson is good as Merek, but he's doing the same schtick as he did in Lethal 3, and though it's perfectly fine, he gets a little to Alan Rickman toward the end. Ina role reversal, Henrikson plays the placid father, which, for anyone who knows the actor is quite a good in joke, as he always plays the bad @ss. The narrative is great, and the set pieces and sets are great for such a low budget. So if you do catch this film, remember, Liotta is fantastic, It debuted at number 1 at the US box office, and it has the best gun ever in film

    To simply describe this movie, it is a version of Lord of the Flies. The idea is that isolated from civilisation, people become like animals. This is partially true in this movie but moreso it seems to fall apart when we see one group of people who are developing their own civilisation. Still, this is similar to Lord of the Flies were one group became savage and hostile, while the others tried to become more civilised. This movie, though, is based on another book: The Penal Colony by Richard Herley and supposedly it is supposed to be a critique on the prison system. In the film, the prisons are supposed to be money making corporations where prisoners assigned there are reduced to slave labour. Basically there is a hierarchy, and the island Absolom is at the top. Prisoners who prove to be too troublesome to turn into slave labourers are banished to the island and are left to fend for themselves. The prison is nice to drop in small amounts of food, but most of the time the inhabitants must scrounge for themselves. If this is supposed to be a critique on the prison system, there seems to be a huge lack of it. What I saw in this movie was a treatise on the savagery of humanity, and the warden is actively trying to encourage the savagery. If they are civilised then they might turn against him, so if they are busy fighting, then all the better. The weird thing I noticed, is that the warden personally came to the island to deal with the problem. Thus he was sticking his neck out in a way that was purely illogical. It seemed to be an excuse to get him there to kill him.

    Martin Campbell ("Goldeneye", "Casino Royal"), a seasoned hand at action movies, directs "No Escape" (aka "Escape from Absolom"). Set in a dystopian future, the film sees actor Ray Liotta imprisoned on a high security island inhabited by gangs of sociopaths and criminals. As he is a well trained American Marine, Liotta uses his violent skills to stay alive, rally men against evil hordes and seek vengeance on the men who imprisoned him. The film's plot is clich&eacute;d (its "Predator" meets "Escape from Alcatraz" meets "Lord of the Flies"), but it has some good set design, action sequences and firmly realises it's but a glorified B movie. Bizarrely, "No Escape" seems to have vaguely predicted the 2011 Libyan conflict. Situated before "The Hunger Games", "Gamer" and "Battle Royale" and after "The Running Man", "Roller Ball" and "Death Race", "Escape from New York", "Beyond Thunderdome", it also continues a trend of caging people and then making them fight, like Gladiators, for salacious audiences. 7.5/10  Worth one viewing.

    There was a spate of movies which centred around people wrongly banged up in escape-proof prisons in some sort of alternate reality quasi-sci-fi setting. In this case, the prison is on an island, and those sent there have split into two groups. One group, the goodies, simply wants to mind its own business and get on with the job of surviving. The other group, the baddies, is savage and warlike and wants to persecute / steal from - wipe out the first group. Shenanigans ensue. This is tosh, but entertaining tosh. Production values are high, there is loads of action, decent performances from a high profile case, treachery when you least expect it from someone from whom you least expect it (or perhaps you do), a performance of eye-rolling pantomime villainy from Stuart Wilson, and satisfying payoffs when you want them. Good fun.

    decent flick. Definitely better than i thought it would be. however there is one moment in the film that supremely creeped me out. There's a moment where the prison warden is reading the rap sheet of capt. Robbins (Ray Liotta), that includes some of his special forces history. He reads off saying something like "oh so you were in Libya Behngazi, in 2011?" Very creepy for a movie made in 94, given whats gone in in Libya, Behngazi and that its happened in 2011. Also the fact that like Capt. Robbins, in in the American special forces, recently 6 soldiers working for British special forces were captured and deported in Behngazi Libya. That was the biggest WTF moment in the movie for me lol. Overall though not a bad flick. Would have been disappointed if I dropped a few bucks on it in theatres, but i saw it cheaply in netflix and it was worth it. check it out!

    Take some pretty good actors, Ray Liotta, Stuart Wilson, Lance Henrekson, Michael Lerner, among others, and put them in an exciting no escape prison situation. That along with a script that keeps the high level of excitement going for a full 118 minutes, and you have a winning combination. Special mention must be made of the excellent Australian location, and the great sets and costumes. Ray Liotta is thrown into the middle of two warring factions, while his only objective is to escape from Michael Lerner's futuristic island prison. Zero women, zero romantic distractions, "No Escape" is 100% action, and exceeds expectations. - MERK

    It's 2022 and Captain John Robbins is convicted of murder and sent to a maximum security prison. Refusing to accept the brutal regime, Robbins rebels and promptly gets sent to a secret place where only the toughest can survive. Absolom, a jungle island inhabited by two groups, The Outsiders and The Insiders. Will John pick a side,? or will he merely go it alone, carrying his anger along the way?. Directed by Martin Campbell {Goldeneye/Casino Royale} and starring Ray Liotta {Robbins}, Lance Henriksen, Kevin Dillon, Ernie Hudson and Stuart Wilson. No Escape is adapted from the novel written by Richard Herley. Naturally it's all complete nonsense, and it for sure feels like a blending of all the other prison/sci-fi/apocalyptic films that have come our way over the years {think Mad Max in Alcatraz type thing}. But it has such an adventurous fun about it, the familiarity of it all is quickly forgotten. The cast appear to be having a great time, Liotta looks like, and acts like he's the hardest man on the planet, Henriksen is smooth in a peaceful role, while Stuart Wilson is revelling in bad guy duties. Campbell knows how to direct action sequences, and here he delivers well within the relatively small budget {it was shot on location in parts of Australia}. For those inclined it's suitably violent, while the story and vision of the future itself is certainly of interest to the discerning sci-fi fan. Not one to remotely take serious of course, but check the brain in at the door and run with it. Because then you may just enjoy its trashy splendour. 6/10

    With the future of basic employment being harness to either robotics or Private businesses, it's little wonder we have a movie which purports to predict what prisons are going to look like in the future. This futuristic film leaves little doubt that if a private warden takes the helm of one of these prisons, things are apt to get out of hand. From an audiences' perspective, we can expect a lot from whomever Hollywood chooses as their main star. In this offering, we have impressive Ray Liotta as Capt. J.T. Robbins, a disgraced Special Forces soldier, who's been court martialed and sent to prison for the murder of his commanding officer. However, the Warden of the prison (Michael Lerner, who is almost believably sadistic) decides to ratchet up his punishment by sending him to ' Absolom' a maximum island prison where life is shortened by the extreme brutality allowed. Here Robbins, meets Walter Marek, a brutal prisoner who leads his 'outsiders' with savage force and who tries to force Robbins to submit to his authority which leads to their jungle confrontation. Robbins also meets 'The Father' (Lance Henriksen) the leader of other convicts living apart in a special compound and who've accepted their punishment, but wish to do their time in peace and companionship. Ernie Hudson plays Hawkins, the security officer for their compound. The action/drama is slow to build, but explodes when it does. Plenty of mayhem follows and through some of the sub-plots a forceful and violent movie appears. A good film for Liotta and Hadson and it's ending is surprisingly unexpected. ****

From an audiences' perspective, we can expect a lot from whomever Hollywood chooses as their main star. In this offering, we have impressive Ray Liotta as Capt. J.T. Robbins, a disgraced Special Forces soldier, who's been court martialed and sent to prison for the murder of his commanding officer. However, the Warden of the prison (Michael Lerner, who is almost believably sadistic) decides to ratchet up his punishment by sending him to ' Absolom' a maximum island prison where life is shortened by the extreme brutality allowed. Here Robbins, meets Walter Marek, a brutal prisoner who leads his 'outsiders' with savage force and who tries to force Robbins to submit to his authority which leads to their jungle confrontation. Robbins also meets 'The Father' (Lance Henriksen) the leader of other convicts living apart in a special compound and who've accepted their punishment, but wish to do their time in peace and companionship. Ernie Hudson plays Hawkins, the security officer for their compound. The action/drama is slow to build, but explodes when it does. Plenty of mayhem follows and through some of the sub-plots a forceful and violent movie appears. A good film for Liotta and Hadson and it's ending is surprisingly unexpected. ****

    Ah, the glorious early nineties! Back when big stars were still appearing in incredibly violent action movies and when over-anxious kids like myself had to secretly sneak into cinemas because you weren't allowed to see these movies under the age of 16. "Escape from Absolom" is a childhood favorite of mine, so my views and opinions may be a bit biased, but still I think they don't make action flicks like this one anymore nowadays. The script may perhaps contain a few gigantic holes and completely illogic twists, but at least it's continuously fast-paced, politically incorrect and spectacular. The year's 2022 and prisons have turned into private companies without government interference. Absolom is the name of a prison colony island where the sadistic warden (Michael Lerner) plays off the Outsiders against the Insiders. The former are an unorganized bunch of savages wearing masks and hunting with primitive weapons, led by the relentless but charismatic Walter Marek. The Insiders, however, attempted to found a peaceful community where they grow crops and seek for moral redemption. The newly arrived and military trained prisoner Robbins would make a great asset for the Insiders, since he's the only one to have ever escaped from the Outsiders, but he's stubborn and anti-social and solely intends to get off the island alone. The concept of "Escape from Absolom" is very reminiscent to copious other (futuristic) prison movies, like "Fortress", "Papillon", "Blood Camp Thatcher", "Escape from NY" , but this one definitely benefices from good production values, staggering filming locations, a devoted cast and the professional direction of Martin Campbell. The battle sequences as well as the violent ordeals Robbins meets in the Outsiders' camp are robust and grisly, including a lot of decapitations and swashbuckling. The high tempo and adrenalin-level is only occasionally overshadowed by overly sentimental biographies and redundant flashbacks. Obviously in a prison colony, everybody has a story to tell about why he ended up there and the film tells too many of them. Ray Liotta's character is an interesting anti-hero, since he remains unreliable and somewhat aloof. The most fascinating character is undoubtedly Walter Merak. He's an insane and power-obsessed dictator with menacing facial expressions and a deranged sense of humor. Merak also narrates R-rated versions of Goldilocks and the Three Bears and eliminates the members of his own "parliament" to gain even more power. It's a stupendous performance from Stuart Wilson; an actor whose other works I'm not really familiar with. The always reliable Lance Henriksen, Ernie Hudson, Kevin J. O'Connor and Ian McNeice deliver awesome roles in the supportive cast. Granted, the movie is far from flawless and the sudden ending is a bit stupid and implausible, but "Escape from Absolom" nevertheless remains one of the highlights of early 90's Sci-Fi/action cinema.

    This is a semi-expensive Film with a B-Movie feel and it is better for it. The slickness is not done in an in your face manner as it just unfolds unpretentiously and is beautiful to behold. The costumes are also quite "attractive" and proudly display their "freak flags" high. The story is somewhat simple and yet some of the complexities and Philosophy about corporate prisons and civilized society are lost in the action and some less than adequate script involvement. But not enough to keep this from being enjoyable escapism. There are some well done, violent battles and some witticisms that are quite amusing. The villain is venomous and quite the psychopathic comedian. In all, this is quite entertaining stuff that never pretends to be more than it is. A kind of throw-back to Matin&eacute;e fare of a by-gone era.

    In the not-too-distant future, Robbins is sent to prison for killing his superior. The corporately (and corruptly) run prison causes Robbins to rebel against the Warden. His rebellion only gets him sent to the most maximum security facility there is - Absolom. The worst hardcore criminals are just dumped onto the island Absolom to live or die as they can. The island is patrolled by heavily armed helicopters and fenced by impenetrable sea defences. Two different societies have formed over the years; an evil 'empire' run by Walter Marek that is conflicting with the other, more pacific, group run by The Father. Resources are kept scarce by the warden as a game to keep the population down by destroying themselves. Who will our hardcore Captain fit in with the best..... This is one of those lost movies that crops up late at night on TV and you have forgotten just how fantastically cheesy it is. Liotta is perfect as the soldier, as he has the balance of 'good' guy and psycho about right. The film is a great vehicle for him. Wilson is good as Merek, but he's doing the same schtick as he did in Lethal 3, and though it's perfectly fine, he gets a little to Alan Rickman toward the end. Ina role reversal, Henrikson plays the placid father, which, for anyone who knows the actor is quite a good in joke, as he always plays the bad @ss. The narrative is great, and the set pieces and sets are great for such a low budget. So if you do catch this film, remember, Liotta is fantastic, It debuted at number 1 at the US box office, and it has the best gun ever in film

    To simply describe this movie, it is a version of Lord of the Flies. The idea is that isolated from civilisation, people become like animals. This is partially true in this movie but moreso it seems to fall apart when we see one group of people who are developing their own civilisation. Still, this is similar to Lord of the Flies were one group became savage and hostile, while the others tried to become more civilised. This movie, though, is based on another book: The Penal Colony by Richard Herley and supposedly it is supposed to be a critique on the prison system. In the film, the prisons are supposed to be money making corporations where prisoners assigned there are reduced to slave labour. Basically there is a hierarchy, and the island Absolom is at the top. Prisoners who prove to be too troublesome to turn into slave labourers are banished to the island and are left to fend for themselves. The prison is nice to drop in small amounts of food, but most of the time the inhabitants must scrounge for themselves. If this is supposed to be a critique on the prison system, there seems to be a huge lack of it. What I saw in this movie was a treatise on the savagery of humanity, and the warden is actively trying to encourage the savagery. If they are civilised then they might turn against him, so if they are busy fighting, then all the better. The weird thing I noticed, is that the warden personally came to the island to deal with the problem. Thus he was sticking his neck out in a way that was purely illogical. It seemed to be an excuse to get him there to kill him.

    Martin Campbell ("Goldeneye", "Casino Royal"), a seasoned hand at action movies, directs "No Escape" (aka "Escape from Absolom"). Set in a dystopian future, the film sees actor Ray Liotta imprisoned on a high security island inhabited by gangs of sociopaths and criminals. As he is a well trained American Marine, Liotta uses his violent skills to stay alive, rally men against evil hordes and seek vengeance on the men who imprisoned him. The film's plot is clich&eacute;d (its "Predator" meets "Escape from Alcatraz" meets "Lord of the Flies"), but it has some good set design, action sequences and firmly realises it's but a glorified B movie. Bizarrely, "No Escape" seems to have vaguely predicted the 2011 Libyan conflict. Situated before "The Hunger Games", "Gamer" and "Battle Royale" and after "The Running Man", "Roller Ball" and "Death Race", "Escape from New York", "Beyond Thunderdome", it also continues a trend of caging people and then making them fight, like Gladiators, for salacious audiences. 7.5/10  Worth one viewing.

    There was a spate of movies which centred around people wrongly banged up in escape-proof prisons in some sort of alternate reality quasi-sci-fi setting. In this case, the prison is on an island, and those sent there have split into two groups. One group, the goodies, simply wants to mind its own business and get on with the job of surviving. The other group, the baddies, is savage and warlike and wants to persecute / steal from - wipe out the first group. Shenanigans ensue. This is tosh, but entertaining tosh. Production values are high, there is loads of action, decent performances from a high profile case, treachery when you least expect it from someone from whom you least expect it (or perhaps you do), a performance of eye-rolling pantomime villainy from Stuart Wilson, and satisfying payoffs when you want them. Good fun.

    decent flick. Definitely better than i thought it would be. however there is one moment in the film that supremely creeped me out. There's a moment where the prison warden is reading the rap sheet of capt. Robbins (Ray Liotta), that includes some of his special forces history. He reads off saying something like "oh so you were in Libya Behngazi, in 2011?" Very creepy for a movie made in 94, given whats gone in in Libya, Behngazi and that its happened in 2011. Also the fact that like Capt. Robbins, in in the American special forces, recently 6 soldiers working for British special forces were captured and deported in Behngazi Libya. That was the biggest WTF moment in the movie for me lol. Overall though not a bad flick. Would have been disappointed if I dropped a few bucks on it in theatres, but i saw it cheaply in netflix and it was worth it. check it out!

    Take some pretty good actors, Ray Liotta, Stuart Wilson, Lance Henrekson, Michael Lerner, among others, and put them in an exciting no escape prison situation. That along with a script that keeps the high level of excitement going for a full 118 minutes, and you have a winning combination. Special mention must be made of the excellent Australian location, and the great sets and costumes. Ray Liotta is thrown into the middle of two warring factions, while his only objective is to escape from Michael Lerner's futuristic island prison. Zero women, zero romantic distractions, "No Escape" is 100% action, and exceeds expectations. - MERK

    It's 2022 and Captain John Robbins is convicted of murder and sent to a maximum security prison. Refusing to accept the brutal regime, Robbins rebels and promptly gets sent to a secret place where only the toughest can survive. Absolom, a jungle island inhabited by two groups, The Outsiders and The Insiders. Will John pick a side,? or will he merely go it alone, carrying his anger along the way?. Directed by Martin Campbell {Goldeneye/Casino Royale} and starring Ray Liotta {Robbins}, Lance Henriksen, Kevin Dillon, Ernie Hudson and Stuart Wilson. No Escape is adapted from the novel written by Richard Herley. Naturally it's all complete nonsense, and it for sure feels like a blending of all the other prison/sci-fi/apocalyptic films that have come our way over the years {think Mad Max in Alcatraz type thing}. But it has such an adventurous fun about it, the familiarity of it all is quickly forgotten. The cast appear to be having a great time, Liotta looks like, and acts like he's the hardest man on the planet, Henriksen is smooth in a peaceful role, while Stuart Wilson is revelling in bad guy duties. Campbell knows how to direct action sequences, and here he delivers well within the relatively small budget {it was shot on location in parts of Australia}. For those inclined it's suitably violent, while the story and vision of the future itself is certainly of interest to the discerning sci-fi fan. Not one to remotely take serious of course, but check the brain in at the door and run with it. Because then you may just enjoy its trashy splendour. 6/10
