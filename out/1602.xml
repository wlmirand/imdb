    Ren&eacute;e Zellweger really turns in a splendid performance as Sonia Horowitz, the wife of a man (Glenn Fitzgerald) who is extremely devout, so devout that he neglects her and does not appreciate what he has. Frustrated, she gets an opportunity to shine, and shine she does. Her brother-in-law Sender (Christopher Eccleston), a man without a conscience, sets her up as one of his jewelry buyers. Sonia (Zellweger) was a woman in chains: her parents, her religion, and society. Her brother-in-law helped her break those chains, but forced more upon her. She eventually got strong enough to break free from him also. At the same time, and we are not shown why or how, her husband became a freer man, and recognized what was truly important. There were also notable performances by Allen Payne and Julianna Margulies.

    I've seen "A Price Above Rubies" completely through twice now and parts of it more than that. Each time I watch it, I recognize symbolisms that I hadn't quite noticed before. With each viewing, I begin to understand messages and meanings that weren't clear to me earlier. Only now do I see enough that is special about the film that I feel ready to share. Other reviewers discussed the main plot and primary characters: Sonia (Renee Zellweger), burning with desires that few can understand, especially at her young age; her husband, Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald), whose religiosity is so overwhelming he can't deal with his wife's needs; Mendel's overbearing brother, Sender (Christopher Eccleston), and sister, Rachel (Julianna Margulies); and Ramon (Allen Payne), the sensual artist whose talents and sexuality offer Sonia the way out of her nightmarish bonds to religious tradition. Watching "Price" again this morning, I finally realized the deeper importance of three characters that received minor mention by only one other reviewer: Sonia's long-dead brother, Yossi (Shelton Dane); the nameless and mysterious "beggar" woman (Kathleen Chalfant); and the unusually honest and grateful Rebbitzn (Kim Hunter). The purpose of these vital characters is to contrast Sonia's earthy spirituality with Mendel's ritualistic piety. Unlike so many films, the script is so tightly written that as I watched it from beginning to end for the second time on IFC, I failed to detect a single scene or shot that could be cut. And while the ending wasn't the kind of sappy-happy Hollywood finale that some might desire, it was realistic and tied up important details of the opening scene very neatly.

    Renee Zellweger stars in "A Price Above Rubies," a 1998 film written and directed by Boaz Yadin. The film also features Christopher Eccleston, Juliana Margolies, and Kim Hunter. Zellweger plays Sonia, a young Hasidic Jew with training as a jeweler, who is married to a religious scholar (Glenn Fitzgerald). He is so devout that he is unable to enjoy having sex with her. Her brother-in-law (Eccleston) offers her a job as a jewelry buyer, and she has sex with him, though again, it isn't enjoyable. While working for him, she discovers an exciting new artist (Allen Payne), who is Puerto Rican. Eventually, the religious restrictions on her, the expectations of her community, and her own rebelliousness become major problems for her. This is a very good film with the lovely Zellweger giving an excellent performance as a frustrated woman who questions the traditions and customs of the orthodox community and wants to build a satisfactory life and career of her own. All of the performances ring true. I am not an orthodox Jew; I'm not even Jewish, but in reading other reviews, the customs and traditions shown are very accurate. "A Price Above Rubies" is dark and melancholy as we go through Sonia's journey, which goes back to the childhood death of her brother. It is well worth seeing.

    Renee Zelleger stars in this film that explores the lives of the Hasidic Jews in a modern world. I have mixed feelings about this film, of which I will explain, without getting into the actual plot or the ramifications or consequences of her actions and therefore avoid getting into a philosophical discussion. I might could have, if I had just seen it last night, but this is two weeks cold. But, then again, the movie's approach doesn't really merit much discussion to begin with. The two best things about it are Renee's earnest effort into portraying a girl, blossoming into a woman, whose world is dictated by her faith, when her heart and/or her mind goes against it; she is quite believable. Also, the film's director makes good use of time and place, and you actually feel you're there with her in her world. On the other hand, as the movie progresses, it begins to resemble a CBS TV drama, with its low-key budget and generic feel to it to please everyone, feeling like a cross between the TV-remake of Grisham's "The Client" (1995) with JoBeth Williams and John Heard, and the Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino TV show "That's Life" (2000-2002.) Particularly the latter. Maybe a touch of "Judging Amy", too. The plot extremes and her desire to be her own person feels like, this week on "The Horowitzes" (the family name.) It addresses the issues by glancing over them, in an artificial episodic way, and then they feel they are being faithful to the subject matter by writing about it all. Lastly, I will note that I appreciated the journal the rabbi kept of all his sins; if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean. It's about the only real thing I took from the whole movie. I know it sounds like I bashed it; but, while I did like certain things about it, on the whole, I don't feel it accomplished what they set out to do.

    Although I thought this was in many ways a good movie, I did think it ridiculous that Catholicism was portrayed as the religion accepting of sensuality and sexual respect for women, with a Hispanic man as the one who knows how to be a real lover, while Orthodox Judaism is depicted as hypocritical, repressive, misogynist, and Jewish men are depicted as either insensitive in bed or as rapists. Aren't there more shades of grey in all groups? There does need to be more exposure of the plight of women in traditional cultures, but I thought this was too steeped in prejudice, knowing it's "okay" to be so toward Orthodox Jews, but of course not toward other minorities, who are treated quite differently by the writer/director. I did appreciate that the director showed how cruel the oppression of women is, and the bind many find themselves in when oppression is carried out and defended by a closed community. But the portrayal of a woman who was violently attacked and repeatedly exploited as remaining "cohesive" in personality and untraumatized in mind was unrealistic, and in a subtle way, minimized the horrors of violence and coercion. I'm sure this was not the director's intention, but in a way it is a distorted view of women to think that we could endure violence without great mental injury.

    I just want to mention that sequence where the old head rabbi dies in the arms of his wife after making love to her. He was inspired to do this after he heard the Zellweger character articulate the heat inside her that would not be satisfied.... At the memorial ritual ceremony, the newly widowed woman smiles in rapture at Sonia. Very telling sequence as it shows the essence of the passion in the Sonia character. This is one of those movies that is riveting upon seeing it again - even if only in parts on TV - years after the initial theatrical release which I saw years ago. I need one more line of text here so let me state that I had to check to see if Renee Zellweger is Jewish in real life. She is not. Goes to show you how well she played this role. Thanks to all those who made such a brilliant film.

    OK, admittedly as an Orthodox woman who LIVES in Boro Park, I'm going to be a little biased against this film. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin's sole purpose in making this film was Orthodox-bashing. With our wigs, modest attire, and separate seating, we're a pretty easy target already. Yakin never made it past the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia off for loving him more than G-d or their parents. Then he deliberately defies his father's order that he not go swimming because of his poor health. 2. Sonia flips out at her son's bris. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe that she never attended one before. Let's face it, even Reform Jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays. 3. Was Mendel sleeping during his chosson classes? He's supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to have been married for over a year, and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other? A little clue--arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with. Nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn't work out. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly, she did not have to go through her lecherous brother-in-law. There are Orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat back and waited for things to happen, and then complained that she didn't like the outcome. That's not standing up to one's environment; that's pandering to stereotype. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved.

    I am not Jewish and I don't have much knowledge regarding the principles of this religion, I can see how this film was less then favorable among the community who is aware of its culture more then I am. The story line was vague at points and we were left with unresolved meanings behind the interaction of Sonia with many characters we meet outside of Hasidic community. I must say however that Ren&eacute;e Zellweger who played Sonia Horowitz was brilliant in this film, her acting, her demeanor, her power, her vigor. Powerful! She carries this film among the rest two-dimensional characters and for that alone I will give the film 10/10.

    Those who say that this movie is about the Jewish rules and community are right. However it is not the whole story. It is also an invitation to travel toward yourself, to find your true nature. It could have been set in any community and give the same powerful message: when something is seriously wrong in your life, look at yourself and find your destiny. Yakin did an excellent job at directing very good actors. You will be captured by the intensity of Renee Zellweger's performance and by how she conveys this feeling of sickness, this feeling that she is not made for the life she has been forced into. The movie does not give a very nice role to the Hassidic community, suggesting a lack of tolerance and comprehension, a community prompt to reject the poor soul who does not comply absolutely to the rules. However, this is compensated in my opinion by several scenes showing how much wisdom and lucidity these people can demonstrate. After all, we are all human beings with our qualities and weaknesses and that is why the message strikes so hard: whatever you've been taught, seek the truth in yourself.

    I would like to comment on Renee's portrayal of the character Sonia--she was absolutely incredible! So many of her roles have been in the "cutesy" genre. This role was devoid of being "cutesy" at all. She was gutsy, believable and did a very good Brooklyn accent. I had never heard of this movie for one reason or another, and I'm glad I caught it on cable. A very, very good movie. One other comment: I am a Protestant, and I know very little about the Jewish faith. This movie peaked my curiosity for more knowledge about Hasidic followers of Judaism. I Googled and read about the beginning of the Hasidic beliefs. Once again, the cinema has enlightened me about a subject I previously had no knowledge of.

    Ren&eacute;e Zellweger really turns in a splendid performance as Sonia Horowitz, the wife of a man (Glenn Fitzgerald) who is extremely devout, so devout that he neglects her and does not appreciate what he has. Frustrated, she gets an opportunity to shine, and shine she does. Her brother-in-law Sender (Christopher Eccleston), a man without a conscience, sets her up as one of his jewelry buyers. Sonia (Zellweger) was a woman in chains: her parents, her religion, and society. Her brother-in-law helped her break those chains, but forced more upon her. She eventually got strong enough to break free from him also. At the same time, and we are not shown why or how, her husband became a freer man, and recognized what was truly important. There were also notable performances by Allen Payne and Julianna Margulies.

    I've seen "A Price Above Rubies" completely through twice now and parts of it more than that. Each time I watch it, I recognize symbolisms that I hadn't quite noticed before. With each viewing, I begin to understand messages and meanings that weren't clear to me earlier. Only now do I see enough that is special about the film that I feel ready to share. Other reviewers discussed the main plot and primary characters: Sonia (Renee Zellweger), burning with desires that few can understand, especially at her young age; her husband, Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald), whose religiosity is so overwhelming he can't deal with his wife's needs; Mendel's overbearing brother, Sender (Christopher Eccleston), and sister, Rachel (Julianna Margulies); and Ramon (Allen Payne), the sensual artist whose talents and sexuality offer Sonia the way out of her nightmarish bonds to religious tradition. Watching "Price" again this morning, I finally realized the deeper importance of three characters that received minor mention by only one other reviewer: Sonia's long-dead brother, Yossi (Shelton Dane); the nameless and mysterious "beggar" woman (Kathleen Chalfant); and the unusually honest and grateful Rebbitzn (Kim Hunter). The purpose of these vital characters is to contrast Sonia's earthy spirituality with Mendel's ritualistic piety. Unlike so many films, the script is so tightly written that as I watched it from beginning to end for the second time on IFC, I failed to detect a single scene or shot that could be cut. And while the ending wasn't the kind of sappy-happy Hollywood finale that some might desire, it was realistic and tied up important details of the opening scene very neatly.

    Renee Zellweger stars in "A Price Above Rubies," a 1998 film written and directed by Boaz Yadin. The film also features Christopher Eccleston, Juliana Margolies, and Kim Hunter. Zellweger plays Sonia, a young Hasidic Jew with training as a jeweler, who is married to a religious scholar (Glenn Fitzgerald). He is so devout that he is unable to enjoy having sex with her. Her brother-in-law (Eccleston) offers her a job as a jewelry buyer, and she has sex with him, though again, it isn't enjoyable. While working for him, she discovers an exciting new artist (Allen Payne), who is Puerto Rican. Eventually, the religious restrictions on her, the expectations of her community, and her own rebelliousness become major problems for her. This is a very good film with the lovely Zellweger giving an excellent performance as a frustrated woman who questions the traditions and customs of the orthodox community and wants to build a satisfactory life and career of her own. All of the performances ring true. I am not an orthodox Jew; I'm not even Jewish, but in reading other reviews, the customs and traditions shown are very accurate. "A Price Above Rubies" is dark and melancholy as we go through Sonia's journey, which goes back to the childhood death of her brother. It is well worth seeing.

    Renee Zelleger stars in this film that explores the lives of the Hasidic Jews in a modern world. I have mixed feelings about this film, of which I will explain, without getting into the actual plot or the ramifications or consequences of her actions and therefore avoid getting into a philosophical discussion. I might could have, if I had just seen it last night, but this is two weeks cold. But, then again, the movie's approach doesn't really merit much discussion to begin with. The two best things about it are Renee's earnest effort into portraying a girl, blossoming into a woman, whose world is dictated by her faith, when her heart and/or her mind goes against it; she is quite believable. Also, the film's director makes good use of time and place, and you actually feel you're there with her in her world. On the other hand, as the movie progresses, it begins to resemble a CBS TV drama, with its low-key budget and generic feel to it to please everyone, feeling like a cross between the TV-remake of Grisham's "The Client" (1995) with JoBeth Williams and John Heard, and the Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino TV show "That's Life" (2000-2002.) Particularly the latter. Maybe a touch of "Judging Amy", too. The plot extremes and her desire to be her own person feels like, this week on "The Horowitzes" (the family name.) It addresses the issues by glancing over them, in an artificial episodic way, and then they feel they are being faithful to the subject matter by writing about it all. Lastly, I will note that I appreciated the journal the rabbi kept of all his sins; if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean. It's about the only real thing I took from the whole movie. I know it sounds like I bashed it; but, while I did like certain things about it, on the whole, I don't feel it accomplished what they set out to do.

    Although I thought this was in many ways a good movie, I did think it ridiculous that Catholicism was portrayed as the religion accepting of sensuality and sexual respect for women, with a Hispanic man as the one who knows how to be a real lover, while Orthodox Judaism is depicted as hypocritical, repressive, misogynist, and Jewish men are depicted as either insensitive in bed or as rapists. Aren't there more shades of grey in all groups? There does need to be more exposure of the plight of women in traditional cultures, but I thought this was too steeped in prejudice, knowing it's "okay" to be so toward Orthodox Jews, but of course not toward other minorities, who are treated quite differently by the writer/director. I did appreciate that the director showed how cruel the oppression of women is, and the bind many find themselves in when oppression is carried out and defended by a closed community. But the portrayal of a woman who was violently attacked and repeatedly exploited as remaining "cohesive" in personality and untraumatized in mind was unrealistic, and in a subtle way, minimized the horrors of violence and coercion. I'm sure this was not the director's intention, but in a way it is a distorted view of women to think that we could endure violence without great mental injury.

    I just want to mention that sequence where the old head rabbi dies in the arms of his wife after making love to her. He was inspired to do this after he heard the Zellweger character articulate the heat inside her that would not be satisfied.... At the memorial ritual ceremony, the newly widowed woman smiles in rapture at Sonia. Very telling sequence as it shows the essence of the passion in the Sonia character. This is one of those movies that is riveting upon seeing it again - even if only in parts on TV - years after the initial theatrical release which I saw years ago. I need one more line of text here so let me state that I had to check to see if Renee Zellweger is Jewish in real life. She is not. Goes to show you how well she played this role. Thanks to all those who made such a brilliant film.

    OK, admittedly as an Orthodox woman who LIVES in Boro Park, I'm going to be a little biased against this film. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin's sole purpose in making this film was Orthodox-bashing. With our wigs, modest attire, and separate seating, we're a pretty easy target already. Yakin never made it past the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia off for loving him more than G-d or their parents. Then he deliberately defies his father's order that he not go swimming because of his poor health. 2. Sonia flips out at her son's bris. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe that she never attended one before. Let's face it, even Reform Jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays. 3. Was Mendel sleeping during his chosson classes? He's supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to have been married for over a year, and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other? A little clue--arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with. Nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn't work out. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly, she did not have to go through her lecherous brother-in-law. There are Orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat back and waited for things to happen, and then complained that she didn't like the outcome. That's not standing up to one's environment; that's pandering to stereotype. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved.

    I am not Jewish and I don't have much knowledge regarding the principles of this religion, I can see how this film was less then favorable among the community who is aware of its culture more then I am. The story line was vague at points and we were left with unresolved meanings behind the interaction of Sonia with many characters we meet outside of Hasidic community. I must say however that Ren&eacute;e Zellweger who played Sonia Horowitz was brilliant in this film, her acting, her demeanor, her power, her vigor. Powerful! She carries this film among the rest two-dimensional characters and for that alone I will give the film 10/10.

    Those who say that this movie is about the Jewish rules and community are right. However it is not the whole story. It is also an invitation to travel toward yourself, to find your true nature. It could have been set in any community and give the same powerful message: when something is seriously wrong in your life, look at yourself and find your destiny. Yakin did an excellent job at directing very good actors. You will be captured by the intensity of Renee Zellweger's performance and by how she conveys this feeling of sickness, this feeling that she is not made for the life she has been forced into. The movie does not give a very nice role to the Hassidic community, suggesting a lack of tolerance and comprehension, a community prompt to reject the poor soul who does not comply absolutely to the rules. However, this is compensated in my opinion by several scenes showing how much wisdom and lucidity these people can demonstrate. After all, we are all human beings with our qualities and weaknesses and that is why the message strikes so hard: whatever you've been taught, seek the truth in yourself.

    I would like to comment on Renee's portrayal of the character Sonia--she was absolutely incredible! So many of her roles have been in the "cutesy" genre. This role was devoid of being "cutesy" at all. She was gutsy, believable and did a very good Brooklyn accent. I had never heard of this movie for one reason or another, and I'm glad I caught it on cable. A very, very good movie. One other comment: I am a Protestant, and I know very little about the Jewish faith. This movie peaked my curiosity for more knowledge about Hasidic followers of Judaism. I Googled and read about the beginning of the Hasidic beliefs. Once again, the cinema has enlightened me about a subject I previously had no knowledge of.

Other reviewers discussed the main plot and primary characters: Sonia (Renee Zellweger), burning with desires that few can understand, especially at her young age; her husband, Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald), whose religiosity is so overwhelming he can't deal with his wife's needs; Mendel's overbearing brother, Sender (Christopher Eccleston), and sister, Rachel (Julianna Margulies); and Ramon (Allen Payne), the sensual artist whose talents and sexuality offer Sonia the way out of her nightmarish bonds to religious tradition. Watching "Price" again this morning, I finally realized the deeper importance of three characters that received minor mention by only one other reviewer: Sonia's long-dead brother, Yossi (Shelton Dane); the nameless and mysterious "beggar" woman (Kathleen Chalfant); and the unusually honest and grateful Rebbitzn (Kim Hunter). The purpose of these vital characters is to contrast Sonia's earthy spirituality with Mendel's ritualistic piety. Unlike so many films, the script is so tightly written that as I watched it from beginning to end for the second time on IFC, I failed to detect a single scene or shot that could be cut. And while the ending wasn't the kind of sappy-happy Hollywood finale that some might desire, it was realistic and tied up important details of the opening scene very neatly.

    Renee Zellweger stars in "A Price Above Rubies," a 1998 film written and directed by Boaz Yadin. The film also features Christopher Eccleston, Juliana Margolies, and Kim Hunter. Zellweger plays Sonia, a young Hasidic Jew with training as a jeweler, who is married to a religious scholar (Glenn Fitzgerald). He is so devout that he is unable to enjoy having sex with her. Her brother-in-law (Eccleston) offers her a job as a jewelry buyer, and she has sex with him, though again, it isn't enjoyable. While working for him, she discovers an exciting new artist (Allen Payne), who is Puerto Rican. Eventually, the religious restrictions on her, the expectations of her community, and her own rebelliousness become major problems for her. This is a very good film with the lovely Zellweger giving an excellent performance as a frustrated woman who questions the traditions and customs of the orthodox community and wants to build a satisfactory life and career of her own. All of the performances ring true. I am not an orthodox Jew; I'm not even Jewish, but in reading other reviews, the customs and traditions shown are very accurate. "A Price Above Rubies" is dark and melancholy as we go through Sonia's journey, which goes back to the childhood death of her brother. It is well worth seeing.

    Renee Zelleger stars in this film that explores the lives of the Hasidic Jews in a modern world. I have mixed feelings about this film, of which I will explain, without getting into the actual plot or the ramifications or consequences of her actions and therefore avoid getting into a philosophical discussion. I might could have, if I had just seen it last night, but this is two weeks cold. But, then again, the movie's approach doesn't really merit much discussion to begin with. The two best things about it are Renee's earnest effort into portraying a girl, blossoming into a woman, whose world is dictated by her faith, when her heart and/or her mind goes against it; she is quite believable. Also, the film's director makes good use of time and place, and you actually feel you're there with her in her world. On the other hand, as the movie progresses, it begins to resemble a CBS TV drama, with its low-key budget and generic feel to it to please everyone, feeling like a cross between the TV-remake of Grisham's "The Client" (1995) with JoBeth Williams and John Heard, and the Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino TV show "That's Life" (2000-2002.) Particularly the latter. Maybe a touch of "Judging Amy", too. The plot extremes and her desire to be her own person feels like, this week on "The Horowitzes" (the family name.) It addresses the issues by glancing over them, in an artificial episodic way, and then they feel they are being faithful to the subject matter by writing about it all. Lastly, I will note that I appreciated the journal the rabbi kept of all his sins; if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean. It's about the only real thing I took from the whole movie. I know it sounds like I bashed it; but, while I did like certain things about it, on the whole, I don't feel it accomplished what they set out to do.

    Although I thought this was in many ways a good movie, I did think it ridiculous that Catholicism was portrayed as the religion accepting of sensuality and sexual respect for women, with a Hispanic man as the one who knows how to be a real lover, while Orthodox Judaism is depicted as hypocritical, repressive, misogynist, and Jewish men are depicted as either insensitive in bed or as rapists. Aren't there more shades of grey in all groups? There does need to be more exposure of the plight of women in traditional cultures, but I thought this was too steeped in prejudice, knowing it's "okay" to be so toward Orthodox Jews, but of course not toward other minorities, who are treated quite differently by the writer/director. I did appreciate that the director showed how cruel the oppression of women is, and the bind many find themselves in when oppression is carried out and defended by a closed community. But the portrayal of a woman who was violently attacked and repeatedly exploited as remaining "cohesive" in personality and untraumatized in mind was unrealistic, and in a subtle way, minimized the horrors of violence and coercion. I'm sure this was not the director's intention, but in a way it is a distorted view of women to think that we could endure violence without great mental injury.

    I just want to mention that sequence where the old head rabbi dies in the arms of his wife after making love to her. He was inspired to do this after he heard the Zellweger character articulate the heat inside her that would not be satisfied.... At the memorial ritual ceremony, the newly widowed woman smiles in rapture at Sonia. Very telling sequence as it shows the essence of the passion in the Sonia character. This is one of those movies that is riveting upon seeing it again - even if only in parts on TV - years after the initial theatrical release which I saw years ago. I need one more line of text here so let me state that I had to check to see if Renee Zellweger is Jewish in real life. She is not. Goes to show you how well she played this role. Thanks to all those who made such a brilliant film.

    OK, admittedly as an Orthodox woman who LIVES in Boro Park, I'm going to be a little biased against this film. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin's sole purpose in making this film was Orthodox-bashing. With our wigs, modest attire, and separate seating, we're a pretty easy target already. Yakin never made it past the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia off for loving him more than G-d or their parents. Then he deliberately defies his father's order that he not go swimming because of his poor health. 2. Sonia flips out at her son's bris. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe that she never attended one before. Let's face it, even Reform Jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays. 3. Was Mendel sleeping during his chosson classes? He's supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to have been married for over a year, and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other? A little clue--arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with. Nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn't work out. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly, she did not have to go through her lecherous brother-in-law. There are Orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat back and waited for things to happen, and then complained that she didn't like the outcome. That's not standing up to one's environment; that's pandering to stereotype. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved.

    I am not Jewish and I don't have much knowledge regarding the principles of this religion, I can see how this film was less then favorable among the community who is aware of its culture more then I am. The story line was vague at points and we were left with unresolved meanings behind the interaction of Sonia with many characters we meet outside of Hasidic community. I must say however that Ren&eacute;e Zellweger who played Sonia Horowitz was brilliant in this film, her acting, her demeanor, her power, her vigor. Powerful! She carries this film among the rest two-dimensional characters and for that alone I will give the film 10/10.

    Those who say that this movie is about the Jewish rules and community are right. However it is not the whole story. It is also an invitation to travel toward yourself, to find your true nature. It could have been set in any community and give the same powerful message: when something is seriously wrong in your life, look at yourself and find your destiny. Yakin did an excellent job at directing very good actors. You will be captured by the intensity of Renee Zellweger's performance and by how she conveys this feeling of sickness, this feeling that she is not made for the life she has been forced into. The movie does not give a very nice role to the Hassidic community, suggesting a lack of tolerance and comprehension, a community prompt to reject the poor soul who does not comply absolutely to the rules. However, this is compensated in my opinion by several scenes showing how much wisdom and lucidity these people can demonstrate. After all, we are all human beings with our qualities and weaknesses and that is why the message strikes so hard: whatever you've been taught, seek the truth in yourself.

    I would like to comment on Renee's portrayal of the character Sonia--she was absolutely incredible! So many of her roles have been in the "cutesy" genre. This role was devoid of being "cutesy" at all. She was gutsy, believable and did a very good Brooklyn accent. I had never heard of this movie for one reason or another, and I'm glad I caught it on cable. A very, very good movie. One other comment: I am a Protestant, and I know very little about the Jewish faith. This movie peaked my curiosity for more knowledge about Hasidic followers of Judaism. I Googled and read about the beginning of the Hasidic beliefs. Once again, the cinema has enlightened me about a subject I previously had no knowledge of.
