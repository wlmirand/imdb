 <sinopse>
  When a gigantic great white shark begins to menace the small island community of Amity, a police chief, a marine scientist and grizzled fisherman set out to stop it.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  It's a hot summer on Amity Island, a small community whose main business is its beaches. When new Sheriff Martin Brody discovers the remains of a shark attack victim, his first inclination is to close the beaches to swimmers. This doesn't sit well with Mayor Larry Vaughn and several of the local businessmen. Brody backs down to his regret as that weekend a young boy is killed by the predator. The dead boy's mother puts out a bounty on the shark and Amity is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fisherman hoping to cash in on the reward. A local fisherman with much experience hunting sharks, Quint, offers to hunt down the creature for a hefty fee. Soon Quint, Brody and Matt Hooper from the Oceanographic Institute are at sea hunting the Great White shark. As Brody succinctly surmises after their first encounter with the creature, they're going to need a bigger boat.

    Steven Spielberg has always been a great filmmaker. He does an excellent job at making a film a lot of fun, a way of making a film exciting. Though he does have many "artistic" films like Schindler's List, he is mainly known for his exciting, fun, adventure films like "Jurassic Park," "E.T.," "Indiana Jones," and ultimately this film, he also does make some artistic films like "Schindler's List." Jaws falls in the earlier category, and although it is a mindless film that has a basic plot, Spielberg was able to pull off a true masterpiece, a fun, thrilling, suspenseful film. Spielberg's directing as always was incredible. Though he doesn't take many intellectually inclined film routes (though he does) he is able to make a film important and memorable. The acting is also a very high point in this film. The acting by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss was incredible. They portray a great team, and have a lot of chemistry on the set. They feel like real people and a real group. Cinematography is basic. Not much to talk about here. Music is brilliant. John Williams produced a basic, yet tense theme song that reminds me of a shark's tail waving and pushing itself through the water. Though the theme is tense, most of the music in this film is cheery in a tropical way, nearly sounding like pirate music. This is an excellent film that is requirement for any movie watcher to check out. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to have not seen this movie. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on a crucial part of film history and will be missing out on an intensely fun experience.

    The first summer blockbuster still delivers after 35 plus years! Acting is top-notch.. Robert Shaw still remains my favorite as the doomed shark hunter Quint.. His speech about the USS Indianapolis, and of course his final encounter with the great white shark are two of my favorite moments in all of the movies i have seen.. I also like when Quint utters the line "Stop playing with yourself Hooper" to Richard Dreyfuss character as he plays a game of what looks like solitaire. Blu-ray version only enhances this gem of a film.. The shark is missing a lot during this picture because of technical flaws but when it appears it is usually in a big way!!

    Jaws is a horror classic with great dialog, characters, scares, score...everything. Spielberg has really done a fine job at bringing this book to the big screen. When a shark comes into unfamiliar waters, it is unlike another shark and starts eating the swimmers. This causes panic among its natives and Chief Brody must find a way to kill this shark even if it puts his own life at risk. This film is a terrific horror film that may freak some people out as the film is not true because the shark only eats humans, but is true in that this could happen in the ocean. The film has some nice jump scares with one that is the one scene that made me jump the most out of any movie ever and I've never seen or hear someone not jump during that scene. When is it, I won't spoil that. The characters are terrific with Hooper, Quint, and Brody, showing the sailor, the expert, and the nobody. Brody is the main character who is a good cop in an unfamiliar area taking a tough situation very well. Hooper is an expert with sharks since he loves them and is a man who hunts sharks with fancy equipment while Quint, a sailor who was in WWII, fishes and uses the fisherman's techniques to capturing fish to kill a shark. The film has great dialog thrown between the characters as Hooper and Brody become friends in a way and help each other while Quint and Hooper loathe each other and yell at each other but not making it too crazy or over dramatic. Adding to the genius of this movie is the score by John Williams, with the classic music. This film is one of the best horror movies as it is very inspirational and a Spielberg classic. Me: A

    Classic film about a killer great white shark loose in a sea side community, and the efforts of the local police chief (Roy Scheider, engaging performance), shark expert(Richard Dreyfuss, also good) and fisherman Quint(Robert Shaw, unforgettable) to track it down and kill it, before the peaceful town of Amity goes bankrupt. Extremely exciting, well constructed thriller has a first-rate script, and of course Steven Spielberg's exemplary direction, pulling a triumph out of a possible disaster(production was much delayed because the mechanical shark malfunctioned) Terrifying and supremely well-crafted thriller is a masterpiece, and kept millions of people out of the ocean for years afterward!

    Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" was a revolutionary motion picture for its time. Before its release, the notion of a 'summer blockbuster' simply didn't exist. Then, this movie came along and became an unstoppable pop culture phenomenon, grossing a then-record $123 million dollars at the box office amidst a wave of critical praise. The story is a fairly simple one. In the sleepy island community of Amity, the normally placid waters are disturbed by an unwelcome visitor in the form of a deadly great white shark. The police chief immediately senses the danger but the town's mayor is reluctant to close the beaches just as tourist season is kicking into gear. When matters escalate the police chief takes it upon himself to recruit a grizzled fisherman to hunt down the dangerous predator. Since the producers wanted to make the shark the star of the picture they didn't go out of their way to cast any big names in leading roles. Instead, they went for talented actors best known for supporting or ensemble roles. To that end, they decided on Roy Scheider as police chief Brody, Robert Shaw as grizzled fisherman Quint and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. All three gave memorable performances, especially Robert Shaw, whose 'U.S.S. Indianapolis' speech is one of the movie's high points. Apart from these three, the acting is ably handled but fairly undistinguished except for Murray Hamilton as the fast-talking mayor. Spielberg's direction is superbly handled, yet he was unaccountably snubbed by Oscar voters. His handling of the film's suspense is so assured that I found the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when watching scenes that were already deeply embedded in my memory. The fact that the mechanical shark didn't work very well was actually serendipitous since it meant that Spielberg had to employ a 'less is more' approach that left more to the viewer's imagination. Another absolutely essential part of the film's allure is the iconic theme music. John Williams' score ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree. Ultimately, the movie brings together fine actors and a compelling script, guided by a master director just beginning to come into his own. The effects may not be absolutely perfect but given all of the difficulties faced, that's no surprise. Minor imperfections aside, "Jaws" is undeniably a top notch thriller that could very well make you afraid to go into the water.

    After so many years, Jaws is probably on my list as one of my five favorite films of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie. It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so I'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more. So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat", "This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propeller, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark", "Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has received it has earned. I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a "making of", deleted scenes and outtakes. Definitely money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The "making of" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. Don't go in the water!!

    I recently got this movie because I am a huge fan of Spielberg's earlier movies. I thought to myself, "Man, I better get this movie on DVD and watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered." It was definitely worth it. It brought back the action and scares of back when I first saw it back in 2007. It does start out slow, but it gradually builds up to the climactic last 45-60 minutes. I'll start out with the acting. It was great. The actors worked very well with the script, and they kept the movie entertaining the first 60-75 minutes. I will say, the beginning was kind of boring, and I was just waiting for the end hour. The end all together makes up for it though. The special effects were awesome for the 70's era of movies. How they made the shark that moves and bites down and stay in the budget of 8 million dollars, I don't know. Although, money was a lot different back in the 70's. I don't know. Anyway, Everything about this movie was pretty good, especially for the 70's, when film wasn't always high-quality like this. In fact the only reason this movie gets a 9 is because it had a boring start. I don't really know what else to review. OH! How about the story? Pretty clich&eacute;'d these days, but probably original back in '75. Today, there are poopy shark movies where they can fly, walk on land, and can stay still, and everybody who knows about sharks know they can't stay still (except one species) or else they suffocate. Syfy really messed up the killer shark genre. Like Sharknado, Super Shark, Dinoshark and 2- headed Shark Attack, just to name a few. It's kind of hard to come across a decent shark movie like this one nowadays. Anyway, I still really like this movie. I give it a 90% because it is realistic for it's time, and is one of the most creative, original killer shark movies I've ever seen. 9/10

    Jaws was the first frightening film I saw when I was a kid, at that age, it gave me a lot of nightmares. Is an important and very special movie for me, it contains the best scariest speech in cinematic history: The story of U.SS Indianapolis that is related by Quint (Robert Shaw), this scene is an instant classic, is one of my favorite scenes of all time, but the truth is that after seen the movie, I made a presentation of various shipwrecks and one of theme was the Indianapolis, I related the story of the Indianapolis and I spoke like Robert Shaw, in a moment I thought that I was him, an iconic character for me and, of course an iconic and symbolic scene. Jaws have also memorable scary scenes, Sheyder and Dreyfuss do a great job but the hero for me is Shaw, probably his best role. Another important thing is the soundtrack, the main theme is considered an absolute classic by all. It the was the first time that a soundtrack caused so many fear and panic to people of getting in the water, that means that Spielberg did his job. Jaws is a masterpiece that you can't get tired of see it.

    I recently got this movie because I am a huge fan of Spielberg's earlier movies. I thought to myself, "Man, I better get this movie on DVD and watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered." It was definitely worth it. It brought back the action and scares of back when I first saw it back in 2007. It does start out slow, but it gradually builds up to the climactic last 45-60 minutes. I'll start out with the acting. It was great. The actors worked very well with the script, and they kept the movie entertaining the first 60-75 minutes. I will say, the beginning was kind of boring, and I was just waiting for the end hour. The end all together makes up for it though. The special effects were awesome for the 70's era of movies. How they made the shark that moves and bites down and stay in the budget of 8 million dollars, I don't know. Although, money was a lot different back in the 70's. I don't know. Anyway, Everything about this movie was pretty good, especially for the 70's, when film wasn't always high-quality like this. In fact the only reason this movie gets a 9 is because it had a boring start. I don't really know what else to review. OH! How about the story? Pretty clich&eacute;'d these days, but probably original back in '75. Today, there are poopy shark movies where they can fly, walk on land, and can stay still, and everybody who knows about sharks know they can't stay still (except one species) or else they suffocate. Syfy really messed up the killer shark genre. Like Sharknado, Super Shark, Dinoshark and 2- headed Shark Attack, just to name a few. It's kind of hard to come across a decent shark movie like this one nowadays. Anyway, I still really like this movie. I give it a 90% because it is realistic for it's time, and is one of the most creative, original killer shark movies I've ever seen. 9/10

    Jaws was the first frightening film I saw when I was a kid, at that age, it gave me a lot of nightmares. Is an important and very special movie for me, it contains the best scariest speech in cinematic history: The story of U.SS Indianapolis that is related by Quint (Robert Shaw), this scene is an instant classic, is one of my favorite scenes of all time, but the truth is that after seen the movie, I made a presentation of various shipwrecks and one of theme was the Indianapolis, I related the story of the Indianapolis and I spoke like Robert Shaw, in a moment I thought that I was him, an iconic character for me and, of course an iconic and symbolic scene. Jaws have also memorable scary scenes, Sheyder and Dreyfuss do a great job but the hero for me is Shaw, probably his best role. Another important thing is the soundtrack, the main theme is considered an absolute classic by all. It the was the first time that a soundtrack caused so many fear and panic to people of getting in the water, that means that Spielberg did his job. Jaws is a masterpiece that you can't get tired of see it.

    Steven Spielberg has always been a great filmmaker. He does an excellent job at making a film a lot of fun, a way of making a film exciting. Though he does have many "artistic" films like Schindler's List, he is mainly known for his exciting, fun, adventure films like "Jurassic Park," "E.T.," "Indiana Jones," and ultimately this film, he also does make some artistic films like "Schindler's List." Jaws falls in the earlier category, and although it is a mindless film that has a basic plot, Spielberg was able to pull off a true masterpiece, a fun, thrilling, suspenseful film. Spielberg's directing as always was incredible. Though he doesn't take many intellectually inclined film routes (though he does) he is able to make a film important and memorable. The acting is also a very high point in this film. The acting by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss was incredible. They portray a great team, and have a lot of chemistry on the set. They feel like real people and a real group. Cinematography is basic. Not much to talk about here. Music is brilliant. John Williams produced a basic, yet tense theme song that reminds me of a shark's tail waving and pushing itself through the water. Though the theme is tense, most of the music in this film is cheery in a tropical way, nearly sounding like pirate music. This is an excellent film that is requirement for any movie watcher to check out. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to have not seen this movie. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on a crucial part of film history and will be missing out on an intensely fun experience.

    The first summer blockbuster still delivers after 35 plus years! Acting is top-notch.. Robert Shaw still remains my favorite as the doomed shark hunter Quint.. His speech about the USS Indianapolis, and of course his final encounter with the great white shark are two of my favorite moments in all of the movies i have seen.. I also like when Quint utters the line "Stop playing with yourself Hooper" to Richard Dreyfuss character as he plays a game of what looks like solitaire. Blu-ray version only enhances this gem of a film.. The shark is missing a lot during this picture because of technical flaws but when it appears it is usually in a big way!!

    Jaws is a horror classic with great dialog, characters, scares, score...everything. Spielberg has really done a fine job at bringing this book to the big screen. When a shark comes into unfamiliar waters, it is unlike another shark and starts eating the swimmers. This causes panic among its natives and Chief Brody must find a way to kill this shark even if it puts his own life at risk. This film is a terrific horror film that may freak some people out as the film is not true because the shark only eats humans, but is true in that this could happen in the ocean. The film has some nice jump scares with one that is the one scene that made me jump the most out of any movie ever and I've never seen or hear someone not jump during that scene. When is it, I won't spoil that. The characters are terrific with Hooper, Quint, and Brody, showing the sailor, the expert, and the nobody. Brody is the main character who is a good cop in an unfamiliar area taking a tough situation very well. Hooper is an expert with sharks since he loves them and is a man who hunts sharks with fancy equipment while Quint, a sailor who was in WWII, fishes and uses the fisherman's techniques to capturing fish to kill a shark. The film has great dialog thrown between the characters as Hooper and Brody become friends in a way and help each other while Quint and Hooper loathe each other and yell at each other but not making it too crazy or over dramatic. Adding to the genius of this movie is the score by John Williams, with the classic music. This film is one of the best horror movies as it is very inspirational and a Spielberg classic. Me: A

    Classic film about a killer great white shark loose in a sea side community, and the efforts of the local police chief (Roy Scheider, engaging performance), shark expert(Richard Dreyfuss, also good) and fisherman Quint(Robert Shaw, unforgettable) to track it down and kill it, before the peaceful town of Amity goes bankrupt. Extremely exciting, well constructed thriller has a first-rate script, and of course Steven Spielberg's exemplary direction, pulling a triumph out of a possible disaster(production was much delayed because the mechanical shark malfunctioned) Terrifying and supremely well-crafted thriller is a masterpiece, and kept millions of people out of the ocean for years afterward!

    Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" was a revolutionary motion picture for its time. Before its release, the notion of a 'summer blockbuster' simply didn't exist. Then, this movie came along and became an unstoppable pop culture phenomenon, grossing a then-record $123 million dollars at the box office amidst a wave of critical praise. The story is a fairly simple one. In the sleepy island community of Amity, the normally placid waters are disturbed by an unwelcome visitor in the form of a deadly great white shark. The police chief immediately senses the danger but the town's mayor is reluctant to close the beaches just as tourist season is kicking into gear. When matters escalate the police chief takes it upon himself to recruit a grizzled fisherman to hunt down the dangerous predator. Since the producers wanted to make the shark the star of the picture they didn't go out of their way to cast any big names in leading roles. Instead, they went for talented actors best known for supporting or ensemble roles. To that end, they decided on Roy Scheider as police chief Brody, Robert Shaw as grizzled fisherman Quint and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. All three gave memorable performances, especially Robert Shaw, whose 'U.S.S. Indianapolis' speech is one of the movie's high points. Apart from these three, the acting is ably handled but fairly undistinguished except for Murray Hamilton as the fast-talking mayor. Spielberg's direction is superbly handled, yet he was unaccountably snubbed by Oscar voters. His handling of the film's suspense is so assured that I found the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when watching scenes that were already deeply embedded in my memory. The fact that the mechanical shark didn't work very well was actually serendipitous since it meant that Spielberg had to employ a 'less is more' approach that left more to the viewer's imagination. Another absolutely essential part of the film's allure is the iconic theme music. John Williams' score ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree. Ultimately, the movie brings together fine actors and a compelling script, guided by a master director just beginning to come into his own. The effects may not be absolutely perfect but given all of the difficulties faced, that's no surprise. Minor imperfections aside, "Jaws" is undeniably a top notch thriller that could very well make you afraid to go into the water.

    After so many years, Jaws is probably on my list as one of my five favorite films of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie. It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so I'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more. So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat", "This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propeller, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark", "Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has received it has earned. I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a "making of", deleted scenes and outtakes. Definitely money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The "making of" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. Don't go in the water!!

It wasn't any propeller, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark", "Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has received it has earned. I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a "making of", deleted scenes and outtakes. Definitely money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The "making of" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. Don't go in the water!!

    I recently got this movie because I am a huge fan of Spielberg's earlier movies. I thought to myself, "Man, I better get this movie on DVD and watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered." It was definitely worth it. It brought back the action and scares of back when I first saw it back in 2007. It does start out slow, but it gradually builds up to the climactic last 45-60 minutes. I'll start out with the acting. It was great. The actors worked very well with the script, and they kept the movie entertaining the first 60-75 minutes. I will say, the beginning was kind of boring, and I was just waiting for the end hour. The end all together makes up for it though. The special effects were awesome for the 70's era of movies. How they made the shark that moves and bites down and stay in the budget of 8 million dollars, I don't know. Although, money was a lot different back in the 70's. I don't know. Anyway, Everything about this movie was pretty good, especially for the 70's, when film wasn't always high-quality like this. In fact the only reason this movie gets a 9 is because it had a boring start. I don't really know what else to review. OH! How about the story? Pretty clich&eacute;'d these days, but probably original back in '75. Today, there are poopy shark movies where they can fly, walk on land, and can stay still, and everybody who knows about sharks know they can't stay still (except one species) or else they suffocate. Syfy really messed up the killer shark genre. Like Sharknado, Super Shark, Dinoshark and 2- headed Shark Attack, just to name a few. It's kind of hard to come across a decent shark movie like this one nowadays. Anyway, I still really like this movie. I give it a 90% because it is realistic for it's time, and is one of the most creative, original killer shark movies I've ever seen. 9/10

    Jaws was the first frightening film I saw when I was a kid, at that age, it gave me a lot of nightmares. Is an important and very special movie for me, it contains the best scariest speech in cinematic history: The story of U.SS Indianapolis that is related by Quint (Robert Shaw), this scene is an instant classic, is one of my favorite scenes of all time, but the truth is that after seen the movie, I made a presentation of various shipwrecks and one of theme was the Indianapolis, I related the story of the Indianapolis and I spoke like Robert Shaw, in a moment I thought that I was him, an iconic character for me and, of course an iconic and symbolic scene. Jaws have also memorable scary scenes, Sheyder and Dreyfuss do a great job but the hero for me is Shaw, probably his best role. Another important thing is the soundtrack, the main theme is considered an absolute classic by all. It the was the first time that a soundtrack caused so many fear and panic to people of getting in the water, that means that Spielberg did his job. Jaws is a masterpiece that you can't get tired of see it.

    Steven Spielberg has always been a great filmmaker. He does an excellent job at making a film a lot of fun, a way of making a film exciting. Though he does have many "artistic" films like Schindler's List, he is mainly known for his exciting, fun, adventure films like "Jurassic Park," "E.T.," "Indiana Jones," and ultimately this film, he also does make some artistic films like "Schindler's List." Jaws falls in the earlier category, and although it is a mindless film that has a basic plot, Spielberg was able to pull off a true masterpiece, a fun, thrilling, suspenseful film. Spielberg's directing as always was incredible. Though he doesn't take many intellectually inclined film routes (though he does) he is able to make a film important and memorable. The acting is also a very high point in this film. The acting by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss was incredible. They portray a great team, and have a lot of chemistry on the set. They feel like real people and a real group. Cinematography is basic. Not much to talk about here. Music is brilliant. John Williams produced a basic, yet tense theme song that reminds me of a shark's tail waving and pushing itself through the water. Though the theme is tense, most of the music in this film is cheery in a tropical way, nearly sounding like pirate music. This is an excellent film that is requirement for any movie watcher to check out. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to have not seen this movie. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on a crucial part of film history and will be missing out on an intensely fun experience.

    The first summer blockbuster still delivers after 35 plus years! Acting is top-notch.. Robert Shaw still remains my favorite as the doomed shark hunter Quint.. His speech about the USS Indianapolis, and of course his final encounter with the great white shark are two of my favorite moments in all of the movies i have seen.. I also like when Quint utters the line "Stop playing with yourself Hooper" to Richard Dreyfuss character as he plays a game of what looks like solitaire. Blu-ray version only enhances this gem of a film.. The shark is missing a lot during this picture because of technical flaws but when it appears it is usually in a big way!!

    Jaws is a horror classic with great dialog, characters, scares, score...everything. Spielberg has really done a fine job at bringing this book to the big screen. When a shark comes into unfamiliar waters, it is unlike another shark and starts eating the swimmers. This causes panic among its natives and Chief Brody must find a way to kill this shark even if it puts his own life at risk. This film is a terrific horror film that may freak some people out as the film is not true because the shark only eats humans, but is true in that this could happen in the ocean. The film has some nice jump scares with one that is the one scene that made me jump the most out of any movie ever and I've never seen or hear someone not jump during that scene. When is it, I won't spoil that. The characters are terrific with Hooper, Quint, and Brody, showing the sailor, the expert, and the nobody. Brody is the main character who is a good cop in an unfamiliar area taking a tough situation very well. Hooper is an expert with sharks since he loves them and is a man who hunts sharks with fancy equipment while Quint, a sailor who was in WWII, fishes and uses the fisherman's techniques to capturing fish to kill a shark. The film has great dialog thrown between the characters as Hooper and Brody become friends in a way and help each other while Quint and Hooper loathe each other and yell at each other but not making it too crazy or over dramatic. Adding to the genius of this movie is the score by John Williams, with the classic music. This film is one of the best horror movies as it is very inspirational and a Spielberg classic. Me: A

    Classic film about a killer great white shark loose in a sea side community, and the efforts of the local police chief (Roy Scheider, engaging performance), shark expert(Richard Dreyfuss, also good) and fisherman Quint(Robert Shaw, unforgettable) to track it down and kill it, before the peaceful town of Amity goes bankrupt. Extremely exciting, well constructed thriller has a first-rate script, and of course Steven Spielberg's exemplary direction, pulling a triumph out of a possible disaster(production was much delayed because the mechanical shark malfunctioned) Terrifying and supremely well-crafted thriller is a masterpiece, and kept millions of people out of the ocean for years afterward!

    Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" was a revolutionary motion picture for its time. Before its release, the notion of a 'summer blockbuster' simply didn't exist. Then, this movie came along and became an unstoppable pop culture phenomenon, grossing a then-record $123 million dollars at the box office amidst a wave of critical praise. The story is a fairly simple one. In the sleepy island community of Amity, the normally placid waters are disturbed by an unwelcome visitor in the form of a deadly great white shark. The police chief immediately senses the danger but the town's mayor is reluctant to close the beaches just as tourist season is kicking into gear. When matters escalate the police chief takes it upon himself to recruit a grizzled fisherman to hunt down the dangerous predator. Since the producers wanted to make the shark the star of the picture they didn't go out of their way to cast any big names in leading roles. Instead, they went for talented actors best known for supporting or ensemble roles. To that end, they decided on Roy Scheider as police chief Brody, Robert Shaw as grizzled fisherman Quint and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. All three gave memorable performances, especially Robert Shaw, whose 'U.S.S. Indianapolis' speech is one of the movie's high points. Apart from these three, the acting is ably handled but fairly undistinguished except for Murray Hamilton as the fast-talking mayor. Spielberg's direction is superbly handled, yet he was unaccountably snubbed by Oscar voters. His handling of the film's suspense is so assured that I found the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when watching scenes that were already deeply embedded in my memory. The fact that the mechanical shark didn't work very well was actually serendipitous since it meant that Spielberg had to employ a 'less is more' approach that left more to the viewer's imagination. Another absolutely essential part of the film's allure is the iconic theme music. John Williams' score ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree. Ultimately, the movie brings together fine actors and a compelling script, guided by a master director just beginning to come into his own. The effects may not be absolutely perfect but given all of the difficulties faced, that's no surprise. Minor imperfections aside, "Jaws" is undeniably a top notch thriller that could very well make you afraid to go into the water.

    After so many years, Jaws is probably on my list as one of my five favorite films of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie. It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so I'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more. So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat", "This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propeller, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark", "Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has received it has earned. I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a "making of", deleted scenes and outtakes. Definitely money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The "making of" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. Don't go in the water!!

    After so many years, Jaws is probably on my list as one of my five favorite films of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie. It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so I'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more. So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat", "This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propeller, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark", "Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has received it has earned. I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a "making of", deleted scenes and outtakes. Definitely money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The "making of" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. Don't go in the water!!

    I recently got this movie because I am a huge fan of Spielberg's earlier movies. I thought to myself, "Man, I better get this movie on DVD and watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered." It was definitely worth it. It brought back the action and scares of back when I first saw it back in 2007. It does start out slow, but it gradually builds up to the climactic last 45-60 minutes. I'll start out with the acting. It was great. The actors worked very well with the script, and they kept the movie entertaining the first 60-75 minutes. I will say, the beginning was kind of boring, and I was just waiting for the end hour. The end all together makes up for it though. The special effects were awesome for the 70's era of movies. How they made the shark that moves and bites down and stay in the budget of 8 million dollars, I don't know. Although, money was a lot different back in the 70's. I don't know. Anyway, Everything about this movie was pretty good, especially for the 70's, when film wasn't always high-quality like this. In fact the only reason this movie gets a 9 is because it had a boring start. I don't really know what else to review. OH! How about the story? Pretty clich&eacute;'d these days, but probably original back in '75. Today, there are poopy shark movies where they can fly, walk on land, and can stay still, and everybody who knows about sharks know they can't stay still (except one species) or else they suffocate. Syfy really messed up the killer shark genre. Like Sharknado, Super Shark, Dinoshark and 2- headed Shark Attack, just to name a few. It's kind of hard to come across a decent shark movie like this one nowadays. Anyway, I still really like this movie. I give it a 90% because it is realistic for it's time, and is one of the most creative, original killer shark movies I've ever seen. 9/10

    Jaws was the first frightening film I saw when I was a kid, at that age, it gave me a lot of nightmares. Is an important and very special movie for me, it contains the best scariest speech in cinematic history: The story of U.SS Indianapolis that is related by Quint (Robert Shaw), this scene is an instant classic, is one of my favorite scenes of all time, but the truth is that after seen the movie, I made a presentation of various shipwrecks and one of theme was the Indianapolis, I related the story of the Indianapolis and I spoke like Robert Shaw, in a moment I thought that I was him, an iconic character for me and, of course an iconic and symbolic scene. Jaws have also memorable scary scenes, Sheyder and Dreyfuss do a great job but the hero for me is Shaw, probably his best role. Another important thing is the soundtrack, the main theme is considered an absolute classic by all. It the was the first time that a soundtrack caused so many fear and panic to people of getting in the water, that means that Spielberg did his job. Jaws is a masterpiece that you can't get tired of see it.

    Steven Spielberg has always been a great filmmaker. He does an excellent job at making a film a lot of fun, a way of making a film exciting. Though he does have many "artistic" films like Schindler's List, he is mainly known for his exciting, fun, adventure films like "Jurassic Park," "E.T.," "Indiana Jones," and ultimately this film, he also does make some artistic films like "Schindler's List." Jaws falls in the earlier category, and although it is a mindless film that has a basic plot, Spielberg was able to pull off a true masterpiece, a fun, thrilling, suspenseful film. Spielberg's directing as always was incredible. Though he doesn't take many intellectually inclined film routes (though he does) he is able to make a film important and memorable. The acting is also a very high point in this film. The acting by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss was incredible. They portray a great team, and have a lot of chemistry on the set. They feel like real people and a real group. Cinematography is basic. Not much to talk about here. Music is brilliant. John Williams produced a basic, yet tense theme song that reminds me of a shark's tail waving and pushing itself through the water. Though the theme is tense, most of the music in this film is cheery in a tropical way, nearly sounding like pirate music. This is an excellent film that is requirement for any movie watcher to check out. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to have not seen this movie. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on a crucial part of film history and will be missing out on an intensely fun experience.

    The first summer blockbuster still delivers after 35 plus years! Acting is top-notch.. Robert Shaw still remains my favorite as the doomed shark hunter Quint.. His speech about the USS Indianapolis, and of course his final encounter with the great white shark are two of my favorite moments in all of the movies i have seen.. I also like when Quint utters the line "Stop playing with yourself Hooper" to Richard Dreyfuss character as he plays a game of what looks like solitaire. Blu-ray version only enhances this gem of a film.. The shark is missing a lot during this picture because of technical flaws but when it appears it is usually in a big way!!

    Jaws is a horror classic with great dialog, characters, scares, score...everything. Spielberg has really done a fine job at bringing this book to the big screen. When a shark comes into unfamiliar waters, it is unlike another shark and starts eating the swimmers. This causes panic among its natives and Chief Brody must find a way to kill this shark even if it puts his own life at risk. This film is a terrific horror film that may freak some people out as the film is not true because the shark only eats humans, but is true in that this could happen in the ocean. The film has some nice jump scares with one that is the one scene that made me jump the most out of any movie ever and I've never seen or hear someone not jump during that scene. When is it, I won't spoil that. The characters are terrific with Hooper, Quint, and Brody, showing the sailor, the expert, and the nobody. Brody is the main character who is a good cop in an unfamiliar area taking a tough situation very well. Hooper is an expert with sharks since he loves them and is a man who hunts sharks with fancy equipment while Quint, a sailor who was in WWII, fishes and uses the fisherman's techniques to capturing fish to kill a shark. The film has great dialog thrown between the characters as Hooper and Brody become friends in a way and help each other while Quint and Hooper loathe each other and yell at each other but not making it too crazy or over dramatic. Adding to the genius of this movie is the score by John Williams, with the classic music. This film is one of the best horror movies as it is very inspirational and a Spielberg classic. Me: A

    Classic film about a killer great white shark loose in a sea side community, and the efforts of the local police chief (Roy Scheider, engaging performance), shark expert(Richard Dreyfuss, also good) and fisherman Quint(Robert Shaw, unforgettable) to track it down and kill it, before the peaceful town of Amity goes bankrupt. Extremely exciting, well constructed thriller has a first-rate script, and of course Steven Spielberg's exemplary direction, pulling a triumph out of a possible disaster(production was much delayed because the mechanical shark malfunctioned) Terrifying and supremely well-crafted thriller is a masterpiece, and kept millions of people out of the ocean for years afterward!

    Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" was a revolutionary motion picture for its time. Before its release, the notion of a 'summer blockbuster' simply didn't exist. Then, this movie came along and became an unstoppable pop culture phenomenon, grossing a then-record $123 million dollars at the box office amidst a wave of critical praise. The story is a fairly simple one. In the sleepy island community of Amity, the normally placid waters are disturbed by an unwelcome visitor in the form of a deadly great white shark. The police chief immediately senses the danger but the town's mayor is reluctant to close the beaches just as tourist season is kicking into gear. When matters escalate the police chief takes it upon himself to recruit a grizzled fisherman to hunt down the dangerous predator. Since the producers wanted to make the shark the star of the picture they didn't go out of their way to cast any big names in leading roles. Instead, they went for talented actors best known for supporting or ensemble roles. To that end, they decided on Roy Scheider as police chief Brody, Robert Shaw as grizzled fisherman Quint and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. All three gave memorable performances, especially Robert Shaw, whose 'U.S.S. Indianapolis' speech is one of the movie's high points. Apart from these three, the acting is ably handled but fairly undistinguished except for Murray Hamilton as the fast-talking mayor. Spielberg's direction is superbly handled, yet he was unaccountably snubbed by Oscar voters. His handling of the film's suspense is so assured that I found the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when watching scenes that were already deeply embedded in my memory. The fact that the mechanical shark didn't work very well was actually serendipitous since it meant that Spielberg had to employ a 'less is more' approach that left more to the viewer's imagination. Another absolutely essential part of the film's allure is the iconic theme music. John Williams' score ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree. Ultimately, the movie brings together fine actors and a compelling script, guided by a master director just beginning to come into his own. The effects may not be absolutely perfect but given all of the difficulties faced, that's no surprise. Minor imperfections aside, "Jaws" is undeniably a top notch thriller that could very well make you afraid to go into the water.

All three gave memorable performances, especially Robert Shaw, whose 'U.S.S. Indianapolis' speech is one of the movie's high points. Apart from these three, the acting is ably handled but fairly undistinguished except for Murray Hamilton as the fast-talking mayor. Spielberg's direction is superbly handled, yet he was unaccountably snubbed by Oscar voters. His handling of the film's suspense is so assured that I found the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when watching scenes that were already deeply embedded in my memory. The fact that the mechanical shark didn't work very well was actually serendipitous since it meant that Spielberg had to employ a 'less is more' approach that left more to the viewer's imagination. Another absolutely essential part of the film's allure is the iconic theme music. John Williams' score ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree. Ultimately, the movie brings together fine actors and a compelling script, guided by a master director just beginning to come into his own. The effects may not be absolutely perfect but given all of the difficulties faced, that's no surprise. Minor imperfections aside, "Jaws" is undeniably a top notch thriller that could very well make you afraid to go into the water.

    After so many years, Jaws is probably on my list as one of my five favorite films of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie. It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so I'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more. So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat", "This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propeller, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark", "Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has received it has earned. I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a "making of", deleted scenes and outtakes. Definitely money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The "making of" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. Don't go in the water!!

    I recently got this movie because I am a huge fan of Spielberg's earlier movies. I thought to myself, "Man, I better get this movie on DVD and watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered." It was definitely worth it. It brought back the action and scares of back when I first saw it back in 2007. It does start out slow, but it gradually builds up to the climactic last 45-60 minutes. I'll start out with the acting. It was great. The actors worked very well with the script, and they kept the movie entertaining the first 60-75 minutes. I will say, the beginning was kind of boring, and I was just waiting for the end hour. The end all together makes up for it though. The special effects were awesome for the 70's era of movies. How they made the shark that moves and bites down and stay in the budget of 8 million dollars, I don't know. Although, money was a lot different back in the 70's. I don't know. Anyway, Everything about this movie was pretty good, especially for the 70's, when film wasn't always high-quality like this. In fact the only reason this movie gets a 9 is because it had a boring start. I don't really know what else to review. OH! How about the story? Pretty clich&eacute;'d these days, but probably original back in '75. Today, there are poopy shark movies where they can fly, walk on land, and can stay still, and everybody who knows about sharks know they can't stay still (except one species) or else they suffocate. Syfy really messed up the killer shark genre. Like Sharknado, Super Shark, Dinoshark and 2- headed Shark Attack, just to name a few. It's kind of hard to come across a decent shark movie like this one nowadays. Anyway, I still really like this movie. I give it a 90% because it is realistic for it's time, and is one of the most creative, original killer shark movies I've ever seen. 9/10

    Jaws was the first frightening film I saw when I was a kid, at that age, it gave me a lot of nightmares. Is an important and very special movie for me, it contains the best scariest speech in cinematic history: The story of U.SS Indianapolis that is related by Quint (Robert Shaw), this scene is an instant classic, is one of my favorite scenes of all time, but the truth is that after seen the movie, I made a presentation of various shipwrecks and one of theme was the Indianapolis, I related the story of the Indianapolis and I spoke like Robert Shaw, in a moment I thought that I was him, an iconic character for me and, of course an iconic and symbolic scene. Jaws have also memorable scary scenes, Sheyder and Dreyfuss do a great job but the hero for me is Shaw, probably his best role. Another important thing is the soundtrack, the main theme is considered an absolute classic by all. It the was the first time that a soundtrack caused so many fear and panic to people of getting in the water, that means that Spielberg did his job. Jaws is a masterpiece that you can't get tired of see it.

    Steven Spielberg has always been a great filmmaker. He does an excellent job at making a film a lot of fun, a way of making a film exciting. Though he does have many "artistic" films like Schindler's List, he is mainly known for his exciting, fun, adventure films like "Jurassic Park," "E.T.," "Indiana Jones," and ultimately this film, he also does make some artistic films like "Schindler's List." Jaws falls in the earlier category, and although it is a mindless film that has a basic plot, Spielberg was able to pull off a true masterpiece, a fun, thrilling, suspenseful film. Spielberg's directing as always was incredible. Though he doesn't take many intellectually inclined film routes (though he does) he is able to make a film important and memorable. The acting is also a very high point in this film. The acting by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss was incredible. They portray a great team, and have a lot of chemistry on the set. They feel like real people and a real group. Cinematography is basic. Not much to talk about here. Music is brilliant. John Williams produced a basic, yet tense theme song that reminds me of a shark's tail waving and pushing itself through the water. Though the theme is tense, most of the music in this film is cheery in a tropical way, nearly sounding like pirate music. This is an excellent film that is requirement for any movie watcher to check out. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to have not seen this movie. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on a crucial part of film history and will be missing out on an intensely fun experience.

    The first summer blockbuster still delivers after 35 plus years! Acting is top-notch.. Robert Shaw still remains my favorite as the doomed shark hunter Quint.. His speech about the USS Indianapolis, and of course his final encounter with the great white shark are two of my favorite moments in all of the movies i have seen.. I also like when Quint utters the line "Stop playing with yourself Hooper" to Richard Dreyfuss character as he plays a game of what looks like solitaire. Blu-ray version only enhances this gem of a film.. The shark is missing a lot during this picture because of technical flaws but when it appears it is usually in a big way!!

    Jaws is a horror classic with great dialog, characters, scares, score...everything. Spielberg has really done a fine job at bringing this book to the big screen. When a shark comes into unfamiliar waters, it is unlike another shark and starts eating the swimmers. This causes panic among its natives and Chief Brody must find a way to kill this shark even if it puts his own life at risk. This film is a terrific horror film that may freak some people out as the film is not true because the shark only eats humans, but is true in that this could happen in the ocean. The film has some nice jump scares with one that is the one scene that made me jump the most out of any movie ever and I've never seen or hear someone not jump during that scene. When is it, I won't spoil that. The characters are terrific with Hooper, Quint, and Brody, showing the sailor, the expert, and the nobody. Brody is the main character who is a good cop in an unfamiliar area taking a tough situation very well. Hooper is an expert with sharks since he loves them and is a man who hunts sharks with fancy equipment while Quint, a sailor who was in WWII, fishes and uses the fisherman's techniques to capturing fish to kill a shark. The film has great dialog thrown between the characters as Hooper and Brody become friends in a way and help each other while Quint and Hooper loathe each other and yell at each other but not making it too crazy or over dramatic. Adding to the genius of this movie is the score by John Williams, with the classic music. This film is one of the best horror movies as it is very inspirational and a Spielberg classic. Me: A

    Classic film about a killer great white shark loose in a sea side community, and the efforts of the local police chief (Roy Scheider, engaging performance), shark expert(Richard Dreyfuss, also good) and fisherman Quint(Robert Shaw, unforgettable) to track it down and kill it, before the peaceful town of Amity goes bankrupt. Extremely exciting, well constructed thriller has a first-rate script, and of course Steven Spielberg's exemplary direction, pulling a triumph out of a possible disaster(production was much delayed because the mechanical shark malfunctioned) Terrifying and supremely well-crafted thriller is a masterpiece, and kept millions of people out of the ocean for years afterward!

    Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" was a revolutionary motion picture for its time. Before its release, the notion of a 'summer blockbuster' simply didn't exist. Then, this movie came along and became an unstoppable pop culture phenomenon, grossing a then-record $123 million dollars at the box office amidst a wave of critical praise. The story is a fairly simple one. In the sleepy island community of Amity, the normally placid waters are disturbed by an unwelcome visitor in the form of a deadly great white shark. The police chief immediately senses the danger but the town's mayor is reluctant to close the beaches just as tourist season is kicking into gear. When matters escalate the police chief takes it upon himself to recruit a grizzled fisherman to hunt down the dangerous predator. Since the producers wanted to make the shark the star of the picture they didn't go out of their way to cast any big names in leading roles. Instead, they went for talented actors best known for supporting or ensemble roles. To that end, they decided on Roy Scheider as police chief Brody, Robert Shaw as grizzled fisherman Quint and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. All three gave memorable performances, especially Robert Shaw, whose 'U.S.S. Indianapolis' speech is one of the movie's high points. Apart from these three, the acting is ably handled but fairly undistinguished except for Murray Hamilton as the fast-talking mayor. Spielberg's direction is superbly handled, yet he was unaccountably snubbed by Oscar voters. His handling of the film's suspense is so assured that I found the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when watching scenes that were already deeply embedded in my memory. The fact that the mechanical shark didn't work very well was actually serendipitous since it meant that Spielberg had to employ a 'less is more' approach that left more to the viewer's imagination. Another absolutely essential part of the film's allure is the iconic theme music. John Williams' score ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree. Ultimately, the movie brings together fine actors and a compelling script, guided by a master director just beginning to come into his own. The effects may not be absolutely perfect but given all of the difficulties faced, that's no surprise. Minor imperfections aside, "Jaws" is undeniably a top notch thriller that could very well make you afraid to go into the water.

Extremely exciting, well constructed thriller has a first-rate script, and of course Steven Spielberg's exemplary direction, pulling a triumph out of a possible disaster(production was much delayed because the mechanical shark malfunctioned) Terrifying and supremely well-crafted thriller is a masterpiece, and kept millions of people out of the ocean for years afterward!

    Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" was a revolutionary motion picture for its time. Before its release, the notion of a 'summer blockbuster' simply didn't exist. Then, this movie came along and became an unstoppable pop culture phenomenon, grossing a then-record $123 million dollars at the box office amidst a wave of critical praise. The story is a fairly simple one. In the sleepy island community of Amity, the normally placid waters are disturbed by an unwelcome visitor in the form of a deadly great white shark. The police chief immediately senses the danger but the town's mayor is reluctant to close the beaches just as tourist season is kicking into gear. When matters escalate the police chief takes it upon himself to recruit a grizzled fisherman to hunt down the dangerous predator. Since the producers wanted to make the shark the star of the picture they didn't go out of their way to cast any big names in leading roles. Instead, they went for talented actors best known for supporting or ensemble roles. To that end, they decided on Roy Scheider as police chief Brody, Robert Shaw as grizzled fisherman Quint and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. All three gave memorable performances, especially Robert Shaw, whose 'U.S.S. Indianapolis' speech is one of the movie's high points. Apart from these three, the acting is ably handled but fairly undistinguished except for Murray Hamilton as the fast-talking mayor. Spielberg's direction is superbly handled, yet he was unaccountably snubbed by Oscar voters. His handling of the film's suspense is so assured that I found the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when watching scenes that were already deeply embedded in my memory. The fact that the mechanical shark didn't work very well was actually serendipitous since it meant that Spielberg had to employ a 'less is more' approach that left more to the viewer's imagination. Another absolutely essential part of the film's allure is the iconic theme music. John Williams' score ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree. Ultimately, the movie brings together fine actors and a compelling script, guided by a master director just beginning to come into his own. The effects may not be absolutely perfect but given all of the difficulties faced, that's no surprise. Minor imperfections aside, "Jaws" is undeniably a top notch thriller that could very well make you afraid to go into the water.

    After so many years, Jaws is probably on my list as one of my five favorite films of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie. It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so I'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more. So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat", "This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propeller, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark", "Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has received it has earned. I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a "making of", deleted scenes and outtakes. Definitely money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The "making of" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. Don't go in the water!!

    I recently got this movie because I am a huge fan of Spielberg's earlier movies. I thought to myself, "Man, I better get this movie on DVD and watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered." It was definitely worth it. It brought back the action and scares of back when I first saw it back in 2007. It does start out slow, but it gradually builds up to the climactic last 45-60 minutes. I'll start out with the acting. It was great. The actors worked very well with the script, and they kept the movie entertaining the first 60-75 minutes. I will say, the beginning was kind of boring, and I was just waiting for the end hour. The end all together makes up for it though. The special effects were awesome for the 70's era of movies. How they made the shark that moves and bites down and stay in the budget of 8 million dollars, I don't know. Although, money was a lot different back in the 70's. I don't know. Anyway, Everything about this movie was pretty good, especially for the 70's, when film wasn't always high-quality like this. In fact the only reason this movie gets a 9 is because it had a boring start. I don't really know what else to review. OH! How about the story? Pretty clich&eacute;'d these days, but probably original back in '75. Today, there are poopy shark movies where they can fly, walk on land, and can stay still, and everybody who knows about sharks know they can't stay still (except one species) or else they suffocate. Syfy really messed up the killer shark genre. Like Sharknado, Super Shark, Dinoshark and 2- headed Shark Attack, just to name a few. It's kind of hard to come across a decent shark movie like this one nowadays. Anyway, I still really like this movie. I give it a 90% because it is realistic for it's time, and is one of the most creative, original killer shark movies I've ever seen. 9/10

    Jaws was the first frightening film I saw when I was a kid, at that age, it gave me a lot of nightmares. Is an important and very special movie for me, it contains the best scariest speech in cinematic history: The story of U.SS Indianapolis that is related by Quint (Robert Shaw), this scene is an instant classic, is one of my favorite scenes of all time, but the truth is that after seen the movie, I made a presentation of various shipwrecks and one of theme was the Indianapolis, I related the story of the Indianapolis and I spoke like Robert Shaw, in a moment I thought that I was him, an iconic character for me and, of course an iconic and symbolic scene. Jaws have also memorable scary scenes, Sheyder and Dreyfuss do a great job but the hero for me is Shaw, probably his best role. Another important thing is the soundtrack, the main theme is considered an absolute classic by all. It the was the first time that a soundtrack caused so many fear and panic to people of getting in the water, that means that Spielberg did his job. Jaws is a masterpiece that you can't get tired of see it.
