    The book JANE EYRE is long. I've watched at least three versions of JANE EYRE (including the Orson Welles version...still think he's the best Rochester yet). Thus, expect that most movies will shorten the rather long ending. I do like where they touch on "the cousins" and hint at the passage of time before...she goes back. But expect that, except in a series, the "cousins" segment gets removed or vastly truncated. It's simply too long...and I think gets the reader way too caught up in Jane's new life. So most Jane Eyre movies will drastically shorten that segment. It's not totally needed. This film is a fairly good interpretation of Jane Eyre. Guess, tho, I see Rochester as more dark...and brooding than William Hurt.

    Franco Zeffirelli brings his Italian flair to a British tale, with French and American actors playing the leads, supported by a mainly British cast (along with Aussies and Kiwis). It works well in a most charming and emotionally satisfying film. Zeffirelli subdues his Italian over-the top expression of emotion; except for the music which brims with feeling and almost tells the story by itself (Capponi and Vlad). The costumes, cinematography, and story line are subdued but effective. It's a Gothic tale, so the "shadows are as important as the light". Rochester is worldly wise and tough as an "India rubber ball". He sees Jane as having a "strange unearthly beauty". He quizzes her her about her talent (strange paintings) and asks her if that head upon her shoulders "has more of the same kind of furniture within ?" Jane must subdue her emotions because she is "his hired servant". Well, you get the idea as the film shows Jane's austere character. I cannot criticize Zeffirelli for bringing the later parts of the novel to a compact finale. It strays cinematically to bring the film to a compressed but satisfying conclusion. And so, readers, "I married him" she announces, but is it to the flawed and broken Edward Rochester or the handsome god-like St. John Rivers? Zeffirelli frames his last shot on the pastoral scene.

    It is early in the 1800s England, young Jane is orphaned and raised in the household of her aunt-in-law, who favors her own three children and mistreats Jane. Until Jane is about 11 or 12, when she is sent to a boarding school. The aunt makes it clear that she doesn't want Jane to return to her home during holidays. Anna Paquin is the young Jane Eyre and, even though her performance lasts only about the first 20 minutes of the film, it is arguably the most critical one here. She established Jane as a straightforward, truthful person that is willing to buck convention and become a woman of independent thought and independent means. The movie follows the familiar arc of the Jane Eyre story, with Charlotte Gainsbourg as the young adult Jane Eyre , taking the job as governess. Gainsbourg is not really a homely person, but her makeup, wardrobe, and hair style made her look very homely, quite a contrast to the pretty women that the master sometimes brought home. The other key character is William Hurt as Rochester, the master of the estate. He uses a passable English accent and is fine. But the movie works because of Jane Eyre, it is her story. I saw this version just two months after the most current version with Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and Michael Fassbender as Rochester. While both of them are very good, I believe I preferred this 1996 version a bit more, for the way the various scenes were presented, and because Gainsbourg I feel is a more effective young adult Jane Eyre.

    I have loved the A&E version of Jane Eyre since I was a child. The story always spoke to me. I very recently finally read the book and was even more blown away and in awe. It is brilliant, fiction at it's finest! After finishing the book I re-watched the A&E version, the newest version with Mia Wasikowska, and the BBC version. All of which are quite brilliant! I was going through netflix and saw this. I got excited that there was a version I had yet to see and I watched it. It didn't take me long to realize it was ridiculous. The plot strays from the book far too much. The writing of the script was terrible. The acting was terrible. Both Jane and Edward are very passionate people. Jane is rather subdued, but still, when reading the novel and in the other film adaptions, you can catch glimpses of her true character. Both of them in this film were like wooden dolls. So lacking in feeling or conviction. And St. John was shoved in here like an afterthought. His part was nothing like how it was supposed to be and his proposal was mind numbingly, hilariously out of character! I laughed through a great deal of this film. And I don't even feel bad saying that.

    This movie is really just not very good. The story was largely rushed and truncated- especially the ending. I know things have to be cut to fit it into such a short time frame (less than two hours) but I feel it was just handled clumsily. The first two thirds of the movie were just mediocre, nothing to write home about, but the last part was just a mess. The acting was nothing special either. Those who were good were wasted in their too-small roles. Those who were featured more were not very good. The two words that appear most in my notes are "flat" and "emotionless." It was an all around disappointment, devoid of all of the passion and fire of the book. Fiona Shaw was very good, but was entirely wasted as Mrs. Reed, in her very limited screen time. Gateshead was way too rushed. Anna Paquin is very good as Jane, but the character is even more feisty than in the book. Even though she was near 25, Charlotte Gainsbourg did look the right age for Jane and they did a pretty good job making her look plain. She was way too tall though (with an very long neck) and although she had everything to make a good Jane, she was pretty dull actually. She was even more reserved and quiet than the book Jane, which, given how passionate her younger self was in this, was especially jarring. If I thought Gainsbourg's Jane was lackluster, that was nothing compared to William Hurt's Rochester. My original feelings on him were "block of wood" and my opinion remains unchanged upon the latest viewing. My above mentioned "flat" and "emotionless" apply to him more than anyone or anything else in this film. Not only did he and Jane not have any chemistry (I'm unsure how they even fell in love in this, since they have so few scenes together), he just didn't seem to care at all. He was so dull! The proposal scene was so passionless, and even their kissing looked staged (i.e. their lips did not really touch). He did not show Rochester's brooding/angry side or the humorous side. He just played a block of wood.

    Director: Franco Zeffirelli Stars:William Hurt, Charlotte Gainsbourg This version of Jane Eyre benefits from the artistic sense of director Franco Zeffirelli, but it shows the financial restraints limiting the production. It is an abridged version in which many critical events are either summarily shown or are omitted. However, It is fairly well organized and well acted. Jane Eyre is a great love story of a couple who meet and feel an immediate attraction for each other. However this attraction evokes conflict in each. This conflict is resolved by suppressing (concealing) their love for one another. Jane's suppression is passive, but Rochester's initial suppression is to treat Jane somewhat coldly, as a master to his servant. However, subtle indications are shown in their relationship where mutual love is hinted - Jane shows jealousy of Rochester's female friend and devoted service to his wishes, while Rochester shows his captivation with Jane's independent and intelligent opinions, her devotion to her moral principles, and her lack of greed and selfishness. However the love grows but remains concealed, again because each is in conflict over loving the other. Jane is in conflict because she realizes she is just a "plain Jane" - a mere servant (although born into a good family), and below the social status of Rochester who would be a prize catch for any lady of high social standing. Rochester is in conflict, not because of Jane's servant status, which is irrelevant to him, but because of his concealed secret that he must never reveal. So each falls deeper in love while fighting hard to mask any display of their love for one another. Simmering conflicts eventually boil over in seeking resolution. This occurs as the turning point in their relationship. The climatic end is the movie's resolution. Some versions handle some of the above key elements better than other versions, but most are lacking to some degree in portraying most of these elements. Hurt's Rochester is well performed as is Gainsbourg's adult Jane, as are supporting performances. The scene depicting the turning point is well done in this version, but other critical events are perfunctory, summarily done, or are omitted. The film is organized but too choppy, as scenes switch quickly instead of being well developed. I have seen all film versions since 1973 as well as the 1943 version. I think that although all versions are very good, many are lacking in some respects. I like the longer versions best as they are more complete. This one is well worth seeing. Please see my reviews of five other versions of Jane Eyre.

    It's curious to see an adaptation that takes away bits of drama and suspense from a novel, instead of adding them. There rather tends to be extra explosions, screams, prolonged farewells and running around mindlessly. Not here. I never expected to see a Jane Eyre without the horrible vision of Bertha in Jane's room and the torn veil, but for some reason this is one of the scenes left out, and it is very telling. The laughter echoing in the corridors is bound to make you uneasy, not scared. The Gothic element is simply missing. And when Jane leaves, she rides a carriage to St John and Mary, whom she's already met, and has no need to wander around the moors without food, dignity or even a name. Nothing dangerous, incredible or hand-of-God-like in all of it. Still this is not a bad film to watch. I liked Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane, although I too would have liked to see her eventually show more wit and "warmth" of character, both in the old and the new sense of the word. I still had the feeling it was there, she was a Jane Eyre, she simply didn't have time. Like St John didn't have time to propose or Blanche Ingram to stage the charades, the fortune teller to appear or the triangle of Helen, Miss Taylor and Jane to be played out. Great material for a film, sadly not there. And Rochester... you had to know him to fill in the gaps. But, I have to say, it was weird to see Anna Paquin and Fiona Shaw in the beginning, as Jane and Aunt Reed, hating each other as much as they did as Sookie Stackhouse and Marnie the necromancer! For that I almost added a star.

    How odd that, within a couple of days of watching the 2011 version at the cinema, this 1996 version is run on one of the satellite channels. My first thought is that it is a good deal less dark and more colourful than the most recent version, although that is of relatively little importance. Charlotte Gainsbourg, an actress of relatively little import in England, does a good job as Jane: she looks right and conducts herself with dignity, independence, and controlled passion. I liked William Hurt's Rochester better than many have: I could detect gentleness beneath the anger. As for the adaptation, much of it seemed very hurried: in particular, from the aborted wedding onwards, events were telescoped together very uncomfortably (Jane would have seen the fire if she had looked back, for instance). So, while not disastrous, there have been better adaptations.

    My favorite part of all the Jane Eyre adaptations is the fight before Rochester proposes, the "I have lived a full life here! I have not been trampled on! Do you think that I'm a machine, that I can bear it? Do you think that because I am poor, plain and little that I have no heart? I have as much heart as you and as much soul, and if God had gifted me with more beauty I would make it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you!" That whole passionate scene, where she finally breaks is my favorite part, and they shortened it to the point that it was near nonexistent!!!there is no passion in her voice at all! and then his response, and the kiss! it is so dull and unimpassioned it makes me want to scream! How could you butcher such a wonderful story and scene!

    I am a fan of the story and book, and while i know that movies from books are never the same, this movie makes so many fundamental changes to the story, that it ruins the experience. passage of time changes, characters change and the whole story is never truly told. it seems the writers were told they could only make a 90 minute film, and decided to slash the story to pieces without care. As with all verisons, they never get her time at school right, and then unlike others, you never believe the chemistry between Jane and Rochester. Anna Paquin is quite charming as a Young Jane, but the adult Jane does not live up to the younger. there are much better versions out there. don't waste your time with this one.

I liked William Hurt's Rochester better than many have: I could detect gentleness beneath the anger. As for the adaptation, much of it seemed very hurried: in particular, from the aborted wedding onwards, events were telescoped together very uncomfortably (Jane would have seen the fire if she had looked back, for instance). So, while not disastrous, there have been better adaptations.

    My favorite part of all the Jane Eyre adaptations is the fight before Rochester proposes, the "I have lived a full life here! I have not been trampled on! Do you think that I'm a machine, that I can bear it? Do you think that because I am poor, plain and little that I have no heart? I have as much heart as you and as much soul, and if God had gifted me with more beauty I would make it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you!" That whole passionate scene, where she finally breaks is my favorite part, and they shortened it to the point that it was near nonexistent!!!there is no passion in her voice at all! and then his response, and the kiss! it is so dull and unimpassioned it makes me want to scream! How could you butcher such a wonderful story and scene!

    I am a fan of the story and book, and while i know that movies from books are never the same, this movie makes so many fundamental changes to the story, that it ruins the experience. passage of time changes, characters change and the whole story is never truly told. it seems the writers were told they could only make a 90 minute film, and decided to slash the story to pieces without care. As with all verisons, they never get her time at school right, and then unlike others, you never believe the chemistry between Jane and Rochester. Anna Paquin is quite charming as a Young Jane, but the adult Jane does not live up to the younger. there are much better versions out there. don't waste your time with this one.

    The book JANE EYRE is long. I've watched at least three versions of JANE EYRE (including the Orson Welles version...still think he's the best Rochester yet). Thus, expect that most movies will shorten the rather long ending. I do like where they touch on "the cousins" and hint at the passage of time before...she goes back. But expect that, except in a series, the "cousins" segment gets removed or vastly truncated. It's simply too long...and I think gets the reader way too caught up in Jane's new life. So most Jane Eyre movies will drastically shorten that segment. It's not totally needed. This film is a fairly good interpretation of Jane Eyre. Guess, tho, I see Rochester as more dark...and brooding than William Hurt.

    Franco Zeffirelli brings his Italian flair to a British tale, with French and American actors playing the leads, supported by a mainly British cast (along with Aussies and Kiwis). It works well in a most charming and emotionally satisfying film. Zeffirelli subdues his Italian over-the top expression of emotion; except for the music which brims with feeling and almost tells the story by itself (Capponi and Vlad). The costumes, cinematography, and story line are subdued but effective. It's a Gothic tale, so the "shadows are as important as the light". Rochester is worldly wise and tough as an "India rubber ball". He sees Jane as having a "strange unearthly beauty". He quizzes her her about her talent (strange paintings) and asks her if that head upon her shoulders "has more of the same kind of furniture within ?" Jane must subdue her emotions because she is "his hired servant". Well, you get the idea as the film shows Jane's austere character. I cannot criticize Zeffirelli for bringing the later parts of the novel to a compact finale. It strays cinematically to bring the film to a compressed but satisfying conclusion. And so, readers, "I married him" she announces, but is it to the flawed and broken Edward Rochester or the handsome god-like St. John Rivers? Zeffirelli frames his last shot on the pastoral scene.

    It is early in the 1800s England, young Jane is orphaned and raised in the household of her aunt-in-law, who favors her own three children and mistreats Jane. Until Jane is about 11 or 12, when she is sent to a boarding school. The aunt makes it clear that she doesn't want Jane to return to her home during holidays. Anna Paquin is the young Jane Eyre and, even though her performance lasts only about the first 20 minutes of the film, it is arguably the most critical one here. She established Jane as a straightforward, truthful person that is willing to buck convention and become a woman of independent thought and independent means. The movie follows the familiar arc of the Jane Eyre story, with Charlotte Gainsbourg as the young adult Jane Eyre , taking the job as governess. Gainsbourg is not really a homely person, but her makeup, wardrobe, and hair style made her look very homely, quite a contrast to the pretty women that the master sometimes brought home. The other key character is William Hurt as Rochester, the master of the estate. He uses a passable English accent and is fine. But the movie works because of Jane Eyre, it is her story. I saw this version just two months after the most current version with Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and Michael Fassbender as Rochester. While both of them are very good, I believe I preferred this 1996 version a bit more, for the way the various scenes were presented, and because Gainsbourg I feel is a more effective young adult Jane Eyre.

    I have loved the A&E version of Jane Eyre since I was a child. The story always spoke to me. I very recently finally read the book and was even more blown away and in awe. It is brilliant, fiction at it's finest! After finishing the book I re-watched the A&E version, the newest version with Mia Wasikowska, and the BBC version. All of which are quite brilliant! I was going through netflix and saw this. I got excited that there was a version I had yet to see and I watched it. It didn't take me long to realize it was ridiculous. The plot strays from the book far too much. The writing of the script was terrible. The acting was terrible. Both Jane and Edward are very passionate people. Jane is rather subdued, but still, when reading the novel and in the other film adaptions, you can catch glimpses of her true character. Both of them in this film were like wooden dolls. So lacking in feeling or conviction. And St. John was shoved in here like an afterthought. His part was nothing like how it was supposed to be and his proposal was mind numbingly, hilariously out of character! I laughed through a great deal of this film. And I don't even feel bad saying that.

    This movie is really just not very good. The story was largely rushed and truncated- especially the ending. I know things have to be cut to fit it into such a short time frame (less than two hours) but I feel it was just handled clumsily. The first two thirds of the movie were just mediocre, nothing to write home about, but the last part was just a mess. The acting was nothing special either. Those who were good were wasted in their too-small roles. Those who were featured more were not very good. The two words that appear most in my notes are "flat" and "emotionless." It was an all around disappointment, devoid of all of the passion and fire of the book. Fiona Shaw was very good, but was entirely wasted as Mrs. Reed, in her very limited screen time. Gateshead was way too rushed. Anna Paquin is very good as Jane, but the character is even more feisty than in the book. Even though she was near 25, Charlotte Gainsbourg did look the right age for Jane and they did a pretty good job making her look plain. She was way too tall though (with an very long neck) and although she had everything to make a good Jane, she was pretty dull actually. She was even more reserved and quiet than the book Jane, which, given how passionate her younger self was in this, was especially jarring. If I thought Gainsbourg's Jane was lackluster, that was nothing compared to William Hurt's Rochester. My original feelings on him were "block of wood" and my opinion remains unchanged upon the latest viewing. My above mentioned "flat" and "emotionless" apply to him more than anyone or anything else in this film. Not only did he and Jane not have any chemistry (I'm unsure how they even fell in love in this, since they have so few scenes together), he just didn't seem to care at all. He was so dull! The proposal scene was so passionless, and even their kissing looked staged (i.e. their lips did not really touch). He did not show Rochester's brooding/angry side or the humorous side. He just played a block of wood.

    Director: Franco Zeffirelli Stars:William Hurt, Charlotte Gainsbourg This version of Jane Eyre benefits from the artistic sense of director Franco Zeffirelli, but it shows the financial restraints limiting the production. It is an abridged version in which many critical events are either summarily shown or are omitted. However, It is fairly well organized and well acted. Jane Eyre is a great love story of a couple who meet and feel an immediate attraction for each other. However this attraction evokes conflict in each. This conflict is resolved by suppressing (concealing) their love for one another. Jane's suppression is passive, but Rochester's initial suppression is to treat Jane somewhat coldly, as a master to his servant. However, subtle indications are shown in their relationship where mutual love is hinted - Jane shows jealousy of Rochester's female friend and devoted service to his wishes, while Rochester shows his captivation with Jane's independent and intelligent opinions, her devotion to her moral principles, and her lack of greed and selfishness. However the love grows but remains concealed, again because each is in conflict over loving the other. Jane is in conflict because she realizes she is just a "plain Jane" - a mere servant (although born into a good family), and below the social status of Rochester who would be a prize catch for any lady of high social standing. Rochester is in conflict, not because of Jane's servant status, which is irrelevant to him, but because of his concealed secret that he must never reveal. So each falls deeper in love while fighting hard to mask any display of their love for one another. Simmering conflicts eventually boil over in seeking resolution. This occurs as the turning point in their relationship. The climatic end is the movie's resolution. Some versions handle some of the above key elements better than other versions, but most are lacking to some degree in portraying most of these elements. Hurt's Rochester is well performed as is Gainsbourg's adult Jane, as are supporting performances. The scene depicting the turning point is well done in this version, but other critical events are perfunctory, summarily done, or are omitted. The film is organized but too choppy, as scenes switch quickly instead of being well developed. I have seen all film versions since 1973 as well as the 1943 version. I think that although all versions are very good, many are lacking in some respects. I like the longer versions best as they are more complete. This one is well worth seeing. Please see my reviews of five other versions of Jane Eyre.

    It's curious to see an adaptation that takes away bits of drama and suspense from a novel, instead of adding them. There rather tends to be extra explosions, screams, prolonged farewells and running around mindlessly. Not here. I never expected to see a Jane Eyre without the horrible vision of Bertha in Jane's room and the torn veil, but for some reason this is one of the scenes left out, and it is very telling. The laughter echoing in the corridors is bound to make you uneasy, not scared. The Gothic element is simply missing. And when Jane leaves, she rides a carriage to St John and Mary, whom she's already met, and has no need to wander around the moors without food, dignity or even a name. Nothing dangerous, incredible or hand-of-God-like in all of it. Still this is not a bad film to watch. I liked Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane, although I too would have liked to see her eventually show more wit and "warmth" of character, both in the old and the new sense of the word. I still had the feeling it was there, she was a Jane Eyre, she simply didn't have time. Like St John didn't have time to propose or Blanche Ingram to stage the charades, the fortune teller to appear or the triangle of Helen, Miss Taylor and Jane to be played out. Great material for a film, sadly not there. And Rochester... you had to know him to fill in the gaps. But, I have to say, it was weird to see Anna Paquin and Fiona Shaw in the beginning, as Jane and Aunt Reed, hating each other as much as they did as Sookie Stackhouse and Marnie the necromancer! For that I almost added a star.

    How odd that, within a couple of days of watching the 2011 version at the cinema, this 1996 version is run on one of the satellite channels. My first thought is that it is a good deal less dark and more colourful than the most recent version, although that is of relatively little importance. Charlotte Gainsbourg, an actress of relatively little import in England, does a good job as Jane: she looks right and conducts herself with dignity, independence, and controlled passion.

    How odd that, within a couple of days of watching the 2011 version at the cinema, this 1996 version is run on one of the satellite channels. My first thought is that it is a good deal less dark and more colourful than the most recent version, although that is of relatively little importance. Charlotte Gainsbourg, an actress of relatively little import in England, does a good job as Jane: she looks right and conducts herself with dignity, independence, and controlled passion. I liked William Hurt's Rochester better than many have: I could detect gentleness beneath the anger. As for the adaptation, much of it seemed very hurried: in particular, from the aborted wedding onwards, events were telescoped together very uncomfortably (Jane would have seen the fire if she had looked back, for instance). So, while not disastrous, there have been better adaptations.

    My favorite part of all the Jane Eyre adaptations is the fight before Rochester proposes, the "I have lived a full life here! I have not been trampled on! Do you think that I'm a machine, that I can bear it? Do you think that because I am poor, plain and little that I have no heart? I have as much heart as you and as much soul, and if God had gifted me with more beauty I would make it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you!" That whole passionate scene, where she finally breaks is my favorite part, and they shortened it to the point that it was near nonexistent!!!there is no passion in her voice at all! and then his response, and the kiss! it is so dull and unimpassioned it makes me want to scream! How could you butcher such a wonderful story and scene!

    I am a fan of the story and book, and while i know that movies from books are never the same, this movie makes so many fundamental changes to the story, that it ruins the experience. passage of time changes, characters change and the whole story is never truly told. it seems the writers were told they could only make a 90 minute film, and decided to slash the story to pieces without care. As with all verisons, they never get her time at school right, and then unlike others, you never believe the chemistry between Jane and Rochester. Anna Paquin is quite charming as a Young Jane, but the adult Jane does not live up to the younger. there are much better versions out there. don't waste your time with this one.

    The book JANE EYRE is long. I've watched at least three versions of JANE EYRE (including the Orson Welles version...still think he's the best Rochester yet). Thus, expect that most movies will shorten the rather long ending. I do like where they touch on "the cousins" and hint at the passage of time before...she goes back. But expect that, except in a series, the "cousins" segment gets removed or vastly truncated. It's simply too long...and I think gets the reader way too caught up in Jane's new life. So most Jane Eyre movies will drastically shorten that segment. It's not totally needed. This film is a fairly good interpretation of Jane Eyre. Guess, tho, I see Rochester as more dark...and brooding than William Hurt.

    Franco Zeffirelli brings his Italian flair to a British tale, with French and American actors playing the leads, supported by a mainly British cast (along with Aussies and Kiwis). It works well in a most charming and emotionally satisfying film. Zeffirelli subdues his Italian over-the top expression of emotion; except for the music which brims with feeling and almost tells the story by itself (Capponi and Vlad). The costumes, cinematography, and story line are subdued but effective. It's a Gothic tale, so the "shadows are as important as the light". Rochester is worldly wise and tough as an "India rubber ball". He sees Jane as having a "strange unearthly beauty". He quizzes her her about her talent (strange paintings) and asks her if that head upon her shoulders "has more of the same kind of furniture within ?" Jane must subdue her emotions because she is "his hired servant". Well, you get the idea as the film shows Jane's austere character. I cannot criticize Zeffirelli for bringing the later parts of the novel to a compact finale. It strays cinematically to bring the film to a compressed but satisfying conclusion. And so, readers, "I married him" she announces, but is it to the flawed and broken Edward Rochester or the handsome god-like St. John Rivers? Zeffirelli frames his last shot on the pastoral scene.

    It is early in the 1800s England, young Jane is orphaned and raised in the household of her aunt-in-law, who favors her own three children and mistreats Jane. Until Jane is about 11 or 12, when she is sent to a boarding school. The aunt makes it clear that she doesn't want Jane to return to her home during holidays. Anna Paquin is the young Jane Eyre and, even though her performance lasts only about the first 20 minutes of the film, it is arguably the most critical one here. She established Jane as a straightforward, truthful person that is willing to buck convention and become a woman of independent thought and independent means. The movie follows the familiar arc of the Jane Eyre story, with Charlotte Gainsbourg as the young adult Jane Eyre , taking the job as governess. Gainsbourg is not really a homely person, but her makeup, wardrobe, and hair style made her look very homely, quite a contrast to the pretty women that the master sometimes brought home. The other key character is William Hurt as Rochester, the master of the estate. He uses a passable English accent and is fine. But the movie works because of Jane Eyre, it is her story. I saw this version just two months after the most current version with Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and Michael Fassbender as Rochester. While both of them are very good, I believe I preferred this 1996 version a bit more, for the way the various scenes were presented, and because Gainsbourg I feel is a more effective young adult Jane Eyre.

    I have loved the A&E version of Jane Eyre since I was a child. The story always spoke to me. I very recently finally read the book and was even more blown away and in awe. It is brilliant, fiction at it's finest! After finishing the book I re-watched the A&E version, the newest version with Mia Wasikowska, and the BBC version. All of which are quite brilliant! I was going through netflix and saw this. I got excited that there was a version I had yet to see and I watched it. It didn't take me long to realize it was ridiculous. The plot strays from the book far too much. The writing of the script was terrible. The acting was terrible. Both Jane and Edward are very passionate people. Jane is rather subdued, but still, when reading the novel and in the other film adaptions, you can catch glimpses of her true character. Both of them in this film were like wooden dolls. So lacking in feeling or conviction. And St. John was shoved in here like an afterthought. His part was nothing like how it was supposed to be and his proposal was mind numbingly, hilariously out of character! I laughed through a great deal of this film. And I don't even feel bad saying that.

    This movie is really just not very good. The story was largely rushed and truncated- especially the ending. I know things have to be cut to fit it into such a short time frame (less than two hours) but I feel it was just handled clumsily. The first two thirds of the movie were just mediocre, nothing to write home about, but the last part was just a mess. The acting was nothing special either. Those who were good were wasted in their too-small roles. Those who were featured more were not very good. The two words that appear most in my notes are "flat" and "emotionless." It was an all around disappointment, devoid of all of the passion and fire of the book. Fiona Shaw was very good, but was entirely wasted as Mrs. Reed, in her very limited screen time. Gateshead was way too rushed. Anna Paquin is very good as Jane, but the character is even more feisty than in the book. Even though she was near 25, Charlotte Gainsbourg did look the right age for Jane and they did a pretty good job making her look plain. She was way too tall though (with an very long neck) and although she had everything to make a good Jane, she was pretty dull actually. She was even more reserved and quiet than the book Jane, which, given how passionate her younger self was in this, was especially jarring. If I thought Gainsbourg's Jane was lackluster, that was nothing compared to William Hurt's Rochester. My original feelings on him were "block of wood" and my opinion remains unchanged upon the latest viewing. My above mentioned "flat" and "emotionless" apply to him more than anyone or anything else in this film. Not only did he and Jane not have any chemistry (I'm unsure how they even fell in love in this, since they have so few scenes together), he just didn't seem to care at all. He was so dull! The proposal scene was so passionless, and even their kissing looked staged (i.e. their lips did not really touch). He did not show Rochester's brooding/angry side or the humorous side. He just played a block of wood.

    Director: Franco Zeffirelli Stars:William Hurt, Charlotte Gainsbourg This version of Jane Eyre benefits from the artistic sense of director Franco Zeffirelli, but it shows the financial restraints limiting the production. It is an abridged version in which many critical events are either summarily shown or are omitted. However, It is fairly well organized and well acted. Jane Eyre is a great love story of a couple who meet and feel an immediate attraction for each other. However this attraction evokes conflict in each. This conflict is resolved by suppressing (concealing) their love for one another. Jane's suppression is passive, but Rochester's initial suppression is to treat Jane somewhat coldly, as a master to his servant. However, subtle indications are shown in their relationship where mutual love is hinted - Jane shows jealousy of Rochester's female friend and devoted service to his wishes, while Rochester shows his captivation with Jane's independent and intelligent opinions, her devotion to her moral principles, and her lack of greed and selfishness. However the love grows but remains concealed, again because each is in conflict over loving the other. Jane is in conflict because she realizes she is just a "plain Jane" - a mere servant (although born into a good family), and below the social status of Rochester who would be a prize catch for any lady of high social standing. Rochester is in conflict, not because of Jane's servant status, which is irrelevant to him, but because of his concealed secret that he must never reveal. So each falls deeper in love while fighting hard to mask any display of their love for one another. Simmering conflicts eventually boil over in seeking resolution. This occurs as the turning point in their relationship. The climatic end is the movie's resolution. Some versions handle some of the above key elements better than other versions, but most are lacking to some degree in portraying most of these elements. Hurt's Rochester is well performed as is Gainsbourg's adult Jane, as are supporting performances. The scene depicting the turning point is well done in this version, but other critical events are perfunctory, summarily done, or are omitted. The film is organized but too choppy, as scenes switch quickly instead of being well developed. I have seen all film versions since 1973 as well as the 1943 version. I think that although all versions are very good, many are lacking in some respects. I like the longer versions best as they are more complete. This one is well worth seeing. Please see my reviews of five other versions of Jane Eyre.

    It's curious to see an adaptation that takes away bits of drama and suspense from a novel, instead of adding them. There rather tends to be extra explosions, screams, prolonged farewells and running around mindlessly. Not here. I never expected to see a Jane Eyre without the horrible vision of Bertha in Jane's room and the torn veil, but for some reason this is one of the scenes left out, and it is very telling. The laughter echoing in the corridors is bound to make you uneasy, not scared. The Gothic element is simply missing. And when Jane leaves, she rides a carriage to St John and Mary, whom she's already met, and has no need to wander around the moors without food, dignity or even a name. Nothing dangerous, incredible or hand-of-God-like in all of it. Still this is not a bad film to watch. I liked Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane, although I too would have liked to see her eventually show more wit and "warmth" of character, both in the old and the new sense of the word. I still had the feeling it was there, she was a Jane Eyre, she simply didn't have time. Like St John didn't have time to propose or Blanche Ingram to stage the charades, the fortune teller to appear or the triangle of Helen, Miss Taylor and Jane to be played out. Great material for a film, sadly not there. And Rochester... you had to know him to fill in the gaps. But, I have to say, it was weird to see Anna Paquin and Fiona Shaw in the beginning, as Jane and Aunt Reed, hating each other as much as they did as Sookie Stackhouse and Marnie the necromancer! For that I almost added a star.

Great material for a film, sadly not there. And Rochester... you had to know him to fill in the gaps. But, I have to say, it was weird to see Anna Paquin and Fiona Shaw in the beginning, as Jane and Aunt Reed, hating each other as much as they did as Sookie Stackhouse and Marnie the necromancer! For that I almost added a star.

    How odd that, within a couple of days of watching the 2011 version at the cinema, this 1996 version is run on one of the satellite channels. My first thought is that it is a good deal less dark and more colourful than the most recent version, although that is of relatively little importance. Charlotte Gainsbourg, an actress of relatively little import in England, does a good job as Jane: she looks right and conducts herself with dignity, independence, and controlled passion. I liked William Hurt's Rochester better than many have: I could detect gentleness beneath the anger. As for the adaptation, much of it seemed very hurried: in particular, from the aborted wedding onwards, events were telescoped together very uncomfortably (Jane would have seen the fire if she had looked back, for instance). So, while not disastrous, there have been better adaptations.

    My favorite part of all the Jane Eyre adaptations is the fight before Rochester proposes, the "I have lived a full life here! I have not been trampled on! Do you think that I'm a machine, that I can bear it? Do you think that because I am poor, plain and little that I have no heart? I have as much heart as you and as much soul, and if God had gifted me with more beauty I would make it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you!" That whole passionate scene, where she finally breaks is my favorite part, and they shortened it to the point that it was near nonexistent!!!there is no passion in her voice at all! and then his response, and the kiss! it is so dull and unimpassioned it makes me want to scream! How could you butcher such a wonderful story and scene!

    I am a fan of the story and book, and while i know that movies from books are never the same, this movie makes so many fundamental changes to the story, that it ruins the experience. passage of time changes, characters change and the whole story is never truly told. it seems the writers were told they could only make a 90 minute film, and decided to slash the story to pieces without care. As with all verisons, they never get her time at school right, and then unlike others, you never believe the chemistry between Jane and Rochester. Anna Paquin is quite charming as a Young Jane, but the adult Jane does not live up to the younger. there are much better versions out there. don't waste your time with this one.

    The book JANE EYRE is long. I've watched at least three versions of JANE EYRE (including the Orson Welles version...still think he's the best Rochester yet). Thus, expect that most movies will shorten the rather long ending. I do like where they touch on "the cousins" and hint at the passage of time before...she goes back. But expect that, except in a series, the "cousins" segment gets removed or vastly truncated. It's simply too long...and I think gets the reader way too caught up in Jane's new life. So most Jane Eyre movies will drastically shorten that segment. It's not totally needed. This film is a fairly good interpretation of Jane Eyre. Guess, tho, I see Rochester as more dark...and brooding than William Hurt.

    Franco Zeffirelli brings his Italian flair to a British tale, with French and American actors playing the leads, supported by a mainly British cast (along with Aussies and Kiwis). It works well in a most charming and emotionally satisfying film. Zeffirelli subdues his Italian over-the top expression of emotion; except for the music which brims with feeling and almost tells the story by itself (Capponi and Vlad). The costumes, cinematography, and story line are subdued but effective. It's a Gothic tale, so the "shadows are as important as the light". Rochester is worldly wise and tough as an "India rubber ball". He sees Jane as having a "strange unearthly beauty". He quizzes her her about her talent (strange paintings) and asks her if that head upon her shoulders "has more of the same kind of furniture within ?" Jane must subdue her emotions because she is "his hired servant". Well, you get the idea as the film shows Jane's austere character. I cannot criticize Zeffirelli for bringing the later parts of the novel to a compact finale. It strays cinematically to bring the film to a compressed but satisfying conclusion. And so, readers, "I married him" she announces, but is it to the flawed and broken Edward Rochester or the handsome god-like St. John Rivers? Zeffirelli frames his last shot on the pastoral scene.

    It is early in the 1800s England, young Jane is orphaned and raised in the household of her aunt-in-law, who favors her own three children and mistreats Jane. Until Jane is about 11 or 12, when she is sent to a boarding school. The aunt makes it clear that she doesn't want Jane to return to her home during holidays. Anna Paquin is the young Jane Eyre and, even though her performance lasts only about the first 20 minutes of the film, it is arguably the most critical one here. She established Jane as a straightforward, truthful person that is willing to buck convention and become a woman of independent thought and independent means. The movie follows the familiar arc of the Jane Eyre story, with Charlotte Gainsbourg as the young adult Jane Eyre , taking the job as governess. Gainsbourg is not really a homely person, but her makeup, wardrobe, and hair style made her look very homely, quite a contrast to the pretty women that the master sometimes brought home. The other key character is William Hurt as Rochester, the master of the estate. He uses a passable English accent and is fine. But the movie works because of Jane Eyre, it is her story. I saw this version just two months after the most current version with Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and Michael Fassbender as Rochester. While both of them are very good, I believe I preferred this 1996 version a bit more, for the way the various scenes were presented, and because Gainsbourg I feel is a more effective young adult Jane Eyre.

    I have loved the A&E version of Jane Eyre since I was a child. The story always spoke to me. I very recently finally read the book and was even more blown away and in awe. It is brilliant, fiction at it's finest! After finishing the book I re-watched the A&E version, the newest version with Mia Wasikowska, and the BBC version. All of which are quite brilliant! I was going through netflix and saw this. I got excited that there was a version I had yet to see and I watched it. It didn't take me long to realize it was ridiculous. The plot strays from the book far too much. The writing of the script was terrible. The acting was terrible. Both Jane and Edward are very passionate people. Jane is rather subdued, but still, when reading the novel and in the other film adaptions, you can catch glimpses of her true character. Both of them in this film were like wooden dolls. So lacking in feeling or conviction. And St. John was shoved in here like an afterthought. His part was nothing like how it was supposed to be and his proposal was mind numbingly, hilariously out of character! I laughed through a great deal of this film. And I don't even feel bad saying that.

    This movie is really just not very good. The story was largely rushed and truncated- especially the ending. I know things have to be cut to fit it into such a short time frame (less than two hours) but I feel it was just handled clumsily. The first two thirds of the movie were just mediocre, nothing to write home about, but the last part was just a mess. The acting was nothing special either. Those who were good were wasted in their too-small roles. Those who were featured more were not very good. The two words that appear most in my notes are "flat" and "emotionless." It was an all around disappointment, devoid of all of the passion and fire of the book. Fiona Shaw was very good, but was entirely wasted as Mrs. Reed, in her very limited screen time. Gateshead was way too rushed. Anna Paquin is very good as Jane, but the character is even more feisty than in the book. Even though she was near 25, Charlotte Gainsbourg did look the right age for Jane and they did a pretty good job making her look plain. She was way too tall though (with an very long neck) and although she had everything to make a good Jane, she was pretty dull actually. She was even more reserved and quiet than the book Jane, which, given how passionate her younger self was in this, was especially jarring. If I thought Gainsbourg's Jane was lackluster, that was nothing compared to William Hurt's Rochester. My original feelings on him were "block of wood" and my opinion remains unchanged upon the latest viewing. My above mentioned "flat" and "emotionless" apply to him more than anyone or anything else in this film. Not only did he and Jane not have any chemistry (I'm unsure how they even fell in love in this, since they have so few scenes together), he just didn't seem to care at all. He was so dull! The proposal scene was so passionless, and even their kissing looked staged (i.e. their lips did not really touch). He did not show Rochester's brooding/angry side or the humorous side. He just played a block of wood.

    Director: Franco Zeffirelli Stars:William Hurt, Charlotte Gainsbourg This version of Jane Eyre benefits from the artistic sense of director Franco Zeffirelli, but it shows the financial restraints limiting the production. It is an abridged version in which many critical events are either summarily shown or are omitted. However, It is fairly well organized and well acted. Jane Eyre is a great love story of a couple who meet and feel an immediate attraction for each other. However this attraction evokes conflict in each. This conflict is resolved by suppressing (concealing) their love for one another. Jane's suppression is passive, but Rochester's initial suppression is to treat Jane somewhat coldly, as a master to his servant. However, subtle indications are shown in their relationship where mutual love is hinted - Jane shows jealousy of Rochester's female friend and devoted service to his wishes, while Rochester shows his captivation with Jane's independent and intelligent opinions, her devotion to her moral principles, and her lack of greed and selfishness. However the love grows but remains concealed, again because each is in conflict over loving the other. Jane is in conflict because she realizes she is just a "plain Jane" - a mere servant (although born into a good family), and below the social status of Rochester who would be a prize catch for any lady of high social standing. Rochester is in conflict, not because of Jane's servant status, which is irrelevant to him, but because of his concealed secret that he must never reveal. So each falls deeper in love while fighting hard to mask any display of their love for one another. Simmering conflicts eventually boil over in seeking resolution. This occurs as the turning point in their relationship. The climatic end is the movie's resolution. Some versions handle some of the above key elements better than other versions, but most are lacking to some degree in portraying most of these elements. Hurt's Rochester is well performed as is Gainsbourg's adult Jane, as are supporting performances. The scene depicting the turning point is well done in this version, but other critical events are perfunctory, summarily done, or are omitted. The film is organized but too choppy, as scenes switch quickly instead of being well developed. I have seen all film versions since 1973 as well as the 1943 version. I think that although all versions are very good, many are lacking in some respects. I like the longer versions best as they are more complete. This one is well worth seeing. Please see my reviews of five other versions of Jane Eyre.

    It's curious to see an adaptation that takes away bits of drama and suspense from a novel, instead of adding them. There rather tends to be extra explosions, screams, prolonged farewells and running around mindlessly. Not here. I never expected to see a Jane Eyre without the horrible vision of Bertha in Jane's room and the torn veil, but for some reason this is one of the scenes left out, and it is very telling. The laughter echoing in the corridors is bound to make you uneasy, not scared. The Gothic element is simply missing. And when Jane leaves, she rides a carriage to St John and Mary, whom she's already met, and has no need to wander around the moors without food, dignity or even a name. Nothing dangerous, incredible or hand-of-God-like in all of it. Still this is not a bad film to watch. I liked Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane, although I too would have liked to see her eventually show more wit and "warmth" of character, both in the old and the new sense of the word. I still had the feeling it was there, she was a Jane Eyre, she simply didn't have time. Like St John didn't have time to propose or Blanche Ingram to stage the charades, the fortune teller to appear or the triangle of Helen, Miss Taylor and Jane to be played out. Great material for a film, sadly not there. And Rochester... you had to know him to fill in the gaps. But, I have to say, it was weird to see Anna Paquin and Fiona Shaw in the beginning, as Jane and Aunt Reed, hating each other as much as they did as Sookie Stackhouse and Marnie the necromancer!

And when Jane leaves, she rides a carriage to St John and Mary, whom she's already met, and has no need to wander around the moors without food, dignity or even a name. Nothing dangerous, incredible or hand-of-God-like in all of it. Still this is not a bad film to watch. I liked Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane, although I too would have liked to see her eventually show more wit and "warmth" of character, both in the old and the new sense of the word. I still had the feeling it was there, she was a Jane Eyre, she simply didn't have time. Like St John didn't have time to propose or Blanche Ingram to stage the charades, the fortune teller to appear or the triangle of Helen, Miss Taylor and Jane to be played out. Great material for a film, sadly not there. And Rochester... you had to know him to fill in the gaps. But, I have to say, it was weird to see Anna Paquin and Fiona Shaw in the beginning, as Jane and Aunt Reed, hating each other as much as they did as Sookie Stackhouse and Marnie the necromancer! For that I almost added a star.

    How odd that, within a couple of days of watching the 2011 version at the cinema, this 1996 version is run on one of the satellite channels. My first thought is that it is a good deal less dark and more colourful than the most recent version, although that is of relatively little importance. Charlotte Gainsbourg, an actress of relatively little import in England, does a good job as Jane: she looks right and conducts herself with dignity, independence, and controlled passion. I liked William Hurt's Rochester better than many have: I could detect gentleness beneath the anger. As for the adaptation, much of it seemed very hurried: in particular, from the aborted wedding onwards, events were telescoped together very uncomfortably (Jane would have seen the fire if she had looked back, for instance). So, while not disastrous, there have been better adaptations.

    My favorite part of all the Jane Eyre adaptations is the fight before Rochester proposes, the "I have lived a full life here! I have not been trampled on! Do you think that I'm a machine, that I can bear it? Do you think that because I am poor, plain and little that I have no heart? I have as much heart as you and as much soul, and if God had gifted me with more beauty I would make it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you!" That whole passionate scene, where she finally breaks is my favorite part, and they shortened it to the point that it was near nonexistent!!!there is no passion in her voice at all! and then his response, and the kiss! it is so dull and unimpassioned it makes me want to scream! How could you butcher such a wonderful story and scene!

    I am a fan of the story and book, and while i know that movies from books are never the same, this movie makes so many fundamental changes to the story, that it ruins the experience. passage of time changes, characters change and the whole story is never truly told. it seems the writers were told they could only make a 90 minute film, and decided to slash the story to pieces without care. As with all verisons, they never get her time at school right, and then unlike others, you never believe the chemistry between Jane and Rochester. Anna Paquin is quite charming as a Young Jane, but the adult Jane does not live up to the younger. there are much better versions out there. don't waste your time with this one.

    The book JANE EYRE is long. I've watched at least three versions of JANE EYRE (including the Orson Welles version...still think he's the best Rochester yet). Thus, expect that most movies will shorten the rather long ending. I do like where they touch on "the cousins" and hint at the passage of time before...she goes back. But expect that, except in a series, the "cousins" segment gets removed or vastly truncated. It's simply too long...and I think gets the reader way too caught up in Jane's new life. So most Jane Eyre movies will drastically shorten that segment. It's not totally needed. This film is a fairly good interpretation of Jane Eyre. Guess, tho, I see Rochester as more dark...and brooding than William Hurt.

    Franco Zeffirelli brings his Italian flair to a British tale, with French and American actors playing the leads, supported by a mainly British cast (along with Aussies and Kiwis). It works well in a most charming and emotionally satisfying film. Zeffirelli subdues his Italian over-the top expression of emotion; except for the music which brims with feeling and almost tells the story by itself (Capponi and Vlad). The costumes, cinematography, and story line are subdued but effective. It's a Gothic tale, so the "shadows are as important as the light". Rochester is worldly wise and tough as an "India rubber ball". He sees Jane as having a "strange unearthly beauty". He quizzes her her about her talent (strange paintings) and asks her if that head upon her shoulders "has more of the same kind of furniture within ?" Jane must subdue her emotions because she is "his hired servant". Well, you get the idea as the film shows Jane's austere character. I cannot criticize Zeffirelli for bringing the later parts of the novel to a compact finale. It strays cinematically to bring the film to a compressed but satisfying conclusion. And so, readers, "I married him" she announces, but is it to the flawed and broken Edward Rochester or the handsome god-like St. John Rivers? Zeffirelli frames his last shot on the pastoral scene.

    It is early in the 1800s England, young Jane is orphaned and raised in the household of her aunt-in-law, who favors her own three children and mistreats Jane. Until Jane is about 11 or 12, when she is sent to a boarding school. The aunt makes it clear that she doesn't want Jane to return to her home during holidays. Anna Paquin is the young Jane Eyre and, even though her performance lasts only about the first 20 minutes of the film, it is arguably the most critical one here. She established Jane as a straightforward, truthful person that is willing to buck convention and become a woman of independent thought and independent means. The movie follows the familiar arc of the Jane Eyre story, with Charlotte Gainsbourg as the young adult Jane Eyre , taking the job as governess. Gainsbourg is not really a homely person, but her makeup, wardrobe, and hair style made her look very homely, quite a contrast to the pretty women that the master sometimes brought home. The other key character is William Hurt as Rochester, the master of the estate. He uses a passable English accent and is fine. But the movie works because of Jane Eyre, it is her story. I saw this version just two months after the most current version with Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and Michael Fassbender as Rochester. While both of them are very good, I believe I preferred this 1996 version a bit more, for the way the various scenes were presented, and because Gainsbourg I feel is a more effective young adult Jane Eyre.

    I have loved the A&E version of Jane Eyre since I was a child. The story always spoke to me. I very recently finally read the book and was even more blown away and in awe. It is brilliant, fiction at it's finest! After finishing the book I re-watched the A&E version, the newest version with Mia Wasikowska, and the BBC version. All of which are quite brilliant! I was going through netflix and saw this. I got excited that there was a version I had yet to see and I watched it. It didn't take me long to realize it was ridiculous. The plot strays from the book far too much. The writing of the script was terrible. The acting was terrible. Both Jane and Edward are very passionate people. Jane is rather subdued, but still, when reading the novel and in the other film adaptions, you can catch glimpses of her true character. Both of them in this film were like wooden dolls. So lacking in feeling or conviction. And St. John was shoved in here like an afterthought. His part was nothing like how it was supposed to be and his proposal was mind numbingly, hilariously out of character! I laughed through a great deal of this film. And I don't even feel bad saying that.

    This movie is really just not very good. The story was largely rushed and truncated- especially the ending. I know things have to be cut to fit it into such a short time frame (less than two hours) but I feel it was just handled clumsily. The first two thirds of the movie were just mediocre, nothing to write home about, but the last part was just a mess. The acting was nothing special either. Those who were good were wasted in their too-small roles. Those who were featured more were not very good. The two words that appear most in my notes are "flat" and "emotionless." It was an all around disappointment, devoid of all of the passion and fire of the book. Fiona Shaw was very good, but was entirely wasted as Mrs. Reed, in her very limited screen time. Gateshead was way too rushed. Anna Paquin is very good as Jane, but the character is even more feisty than in the book. Even though she was near 25, Charlotte Gainsbourg did look the right age for Jane and they did a pretty good job making her look plain. She was way too tall though (with an very long neck) and although she had everything to make a good Jane, she was pretty dull actually. She was even more reserved and quiet than the book Jane, which, given how passionate her younger self was in this, was especially jarring. If I thought Gainsbourg's Jane was lackluster, that was nothing compared to William Hurt's Rochester. My original feelings on him were "block of wood" and my opinion remains unchanged upon the latest viewing. My above mentioned "flat" and "emotionless" apply to him more than anyone or anything else in this film. Not only did he and Jane not have any chemistry (I'm unsure how they even fell in love in this, since they have so few scenes together), he just didn't seem to care at all. He was so dull! The proposal scene was so passionless, and even their kissing looked staged (i.e. their lips did not really touch). He did not show Rochester's brooding/angry side or the humorous side. He just played a block of wood.

    Director: Franco Zeffirelli Stars:William Hurt, Charlotte Gainsbourg This version of Jane Eyre benefits from the artistic sense of director Franco Zeffirelli, but it shows the financial restraints limiting the production. It is an abridged version in which many critical events are either summarily shown or are omitted. However, It is fairly well organized and well acted. Jane Eyre is a great love story of a couple who meet and feel an immediate attraction for each other. However this attraction evokes conflict in each. This conflict is resolved by suppressing (concealing) their love for one another. Jane's suppression is passive, but Rochester's initial suppression is to treat Jane somewhat coldly, as a master to his servant. However, subtle indications are shown in their relationship where mutual love is hinted - Jane shows jealousy of Rochester's female friend and devoted service to his wishes, while Rochester shows his captivation with Jane's independent and intelligent opinions, her devotion to her moral principles, and her lack of greed and selfishness. However the love grows but remains concealed, again because each is in conflict over loving the other. Jane is in conflict because she realizes she is just a "plain Jane" - a mere servant (although born into a good family), and below the social status of Rochester who would be a prize catch for any lady of high social standing. Rochester is in conflict, not because of Jane's servant status, which is irrelevant to him, but because of his concealed secret that he must never reveal. So each falls deeper in love while fighting hard to mask any display of their love for one another. Simmering conflicts eventually boil over in seeking resolution. This occurs as the turning point in their relationship. The climatic end is the movie's resolution. Some versions handle some of the above key elements better than other versions, but most are lacking to some degree in portraying most of these elements. Hurt's Rochester is well performed as is Gainsbourg's adult Jane, as are supporting performances. The scene depicting the turning point is well done in this version, but other critical events are perfunctory, summarily done, or are omitted. The film is organized but too choppy, as scenes switch quickly instead of being well developed. I have seen all film versions since 1973 as well as the 1943 version. I think that although all versions are very good, many are lacking in some respects. I like the longer versions best as they are more complete. This one is well worth seeing. Please see my reviews of five other versions of Jane Eyre.

    It's curious to see an adaptation that takes away bits of drama and suspense from a novel, instead of adding them. There rather tends to be extra explosions, screams, prolonged farewells and running around mindlessly. Not here. I never expected to see a Jane Eyre without the horrible vision of Bertha in Jane's room and the torn veil, but for some reason this is one of the scenes left out, and it is very telling. The laughter echoing in the corridors is bound to make you uneasy, not scared. The Gothic element is simply missing. And when Jane leaves, she rides a carriage to St John and Mary, whom she's already met, and has no need to wander around the moors without food, dignity or even a name. Nothing dangerous, incredible or hand-of-God-like in all of it. Still this is not a bad film to watch. I liked Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane, although I too would have liked to see her eventually show more wit and "warmth" of character, both in the old and the new sense of the word. I still had the feeling it was there, she was a Jane Eyre, she simply didn't have time. Like St John didn't have time to propose or Blanche Ingram to stage the charades, the fortune teller to appear or the triangle of Helen, Miss Taylor and Jane to be played out. Great material for a film, sadly not there. And Rochester... you had to know him to fill in the gaps. But, I have to say, it was weird to see Anna Paquin and Fiona Shaw in the beginning, as Jane and Aunt Reed, hating each other as much as they did as Sookie Stackhouse and Marnie the necromancer!

    It's curious to see an adaptation that takes away bits of drama and suspense from a novel, instead of adding them. There rather tends to be extra explosions, screams, prolonged farewells and running around mindlessly. Not here. I never expected to see a Jane Eyre without the horrible vision of Bertha in Jane's room and the torn veil, but for some reason this is one of the scenes left out, and it is very telling. The laughter echoing in the corridors is bound to make you uneasy, not scared. The Gothic element is simply missing. And when Jane leaves, she rides a carriage to St John and Mary, whom she's already met, and has no need to wander around the moors without food, dignity or even a name. Nothing dangerous, incredible or hand-of-God-like in all of it. Still this is not a bad film to watch. I liked Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane, although I too would have liked to see her eventually show more wit and "warmth" of character, both in the old and the new sense of the word. I still had the feeling it was there, she was a Jane Eyre, she simply didn't have time. Like St John didn't have time to propose or Blanche Ingram to stage the charades, the fortune teller to appear or the triangle of Helen, Miss Taylor and Jane to be played out. Great material for a film, sadly not there. And Rochester... you had to know him to fill in the gaps. But, I have to say, it was weird to see Anna Paquin and Fiona Shaw in the beginning, as Jane and Aunt Reed, hating each other as much as they did as Sookie Stackhouse and Marnie the necromancer! For that I almost added a star.

    How odd that, within a couple of days of watching the 2011 version at the cinema, this 1996 version is run on one of the satellite channels. My first thought is that it is a good deal less dark and more colourful than the most recent version, although that is of relatively little importance. Charlotte Gainsbourg, an actress of relatively little import in England, does a good job as Jane: she looks right and conducts herself with dignity, independence, and controlled passion. I liked William Hurt's Rochester better than many have: I could detect gentleness beneath the anger. As for the adaptation, much of it seemed very hurried: in particular, from the aborted wedding onwards, events were telescoped together very uncomfortably (Jane would have seen the fire if she had looked back, for instance). So, while not disastrous, there have been better adaptations.

    My favorite part of all the Jane Eyre adaptations is the fight before Rochester proposes, the "I have lived a full life here! I have not been trampled on! Do you think that I'm a machine, that I can bear it? Do you think that because I am poor, plain and little that I have no heart? I have as much heart as you and as much soul, and if God had gifted me with more beauty I would make it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you!" That whole passionate scene, where she finally breaks is my favorite part, and they shortened it to the point that it was near nonexistent!!!there is no passion in her voice at all! and then his response, and the kiss! it is so dull and unimpassioned it makes me want to scream! How could you butcher such a wonderful story and scene!

    I am a fan of the story and book, and while i know that movies from books are never the same, this movie makes so many fundamental changes to the story, that it ruins the experience. passage of time changes, characters change and the whole story is never truly told. it seems the writers were told they could only make a 90 minute film, and decided to slash the story to pieces without care. As with all verisons, they never get her time at school right, and then unlike others, you never believe the chemistry between Jane and Rochester. Anna Paquin is quite charming as a Young Jane, but the adult Jane does not live up to the younger. there are much better versions out there. don't waste your time with this one.
