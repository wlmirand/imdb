    Frankly, while Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had wonderfully chemistry, I don't feel the Astaire/Rogers films were his best movies. Band Wagon, for one, was much better, and in terms of dance partners, Eleanor Powell was much more impressive than Rogers. Still, I watched all the Astaire/Rogers films when I was in college, and I enjoyed them, less for the dancing (I really like Astaire best in his novelty numbers, like dancing with a coat rack or firecrackers) than with the goofy comedy of supporting players like Edward Everett Horton. Top Hat is a very good example of the Astaire Rogers formula. Astaire and Rogers coo and snipe, supporting players are amusingly befuddled, the story is an amusing though remarkably dopey comedy of errors, and there is quite a lot of dancing. The songs by Irving Berlin are some of his best, and the dancing is, of course, excellent, even though I'm really more a fan of Gene Kelly's earthier approach. If you like Astaire/Rogers movies, you'll like this one. If you've never seen one, this is a good place to start. I don't consider it a great movie by any means, but it is consistently entertaining.

    If there was one film that comes to mind when thinking of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers it would be Top Hat. And it is easy to see why because it is a wonderful film, whether as a musical, comedy or a timeless and unsurpassed partnership. The story isn't its strongest asset, some may argue that it's the story that they remember the least about Top Hat and a lot of Fred and Ginger's other outings. However that doesn't matter all that much, because it still has a fantastical fun element and told with a lot of charm and warmth. And because everything here just works amazingly well. The art-d&eacute;cor settings are very sumptuous, with costumes that are equally stunning(some of Ginger Rogers' dresses have to be seen to be believed) and handsome photography. Irving Berlin's score and songs are some of the best of any 30s-50s film musical, the witty lyrics, charming melodies and distinctive style is just a joy to listen to throughout. Top Hat, White Tie and Tails is a very catchy title number and really allows Fred Astaire to make it his own, while Isn't It a Lovely Day is one of Berlin's most beautiful songs and Cheek to Cheek has some of the best choreography of any single song of any Fred and Ginger film. Piccolino also comes across very well, Ginger's singing isn't a wow factor but the song itself and the lively choreography do win you over. The songs are helped by the choreography, which is glamorous, good-natured and looks so light-as-a-feather when Fred and Ginger do it. The dialogue is very witty and warm-hearted, the highlights were the hansom-cab scene and anything involving Beddini. The characters are eccentric but immensely likable, it's very easy to warm to and relate to Jerry. And there's no going wrong with the performances either, Fred and Ginger's dance partnership is deservedly iconic, you just admire and sometimes envy how poised and athletic they both are, and their individual performances are just as charming, especially Astaire. The supporting cast sparkle just as much, especially Erik Rhodes who steals every scene he's in and even at times the whole film. In conclusion, a Fred and Ginger classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This film will leave you screaming and dancing with delight! This film seriously reeks with class. Fred Astaire's character and Ginger Rodger's character are both extremely likable and cool. The dancing is truly amazing, you will suddenly feel very jealous of Mr Astaire after watching this movie. He makes everything look so easy when he dances. His voice seems really silky and soft when he sings and there is one Tap Dancing scene which will leave your tongue hanging out from your mouth. I must say first that this film is light. Don't bring your notebook out and start writing notes on the themes and ideas expressed through the movie, because you won't enjoy it. The plot is slight and over all a bit of nonsense. But it seems to take itself super seriously, but that, I think, is all part of the fun. There are only a few characters, they seem to breakthrough the stereotypes which is good. The art Deco style of London and the beauty of Venice is captured perfectly and I do get distracted sometimes by the background! I must say this, that this film is old. So, the camera shots are simpler, the acting isn't in your face and the film may feel a little slow, but this is part of the charm. There are only a handful of songs, sung by Astaire and Ginger, but they a good songs, including Cheek to Cheek and Top Hat, White tie and Tails. Great popcorn movie to enjoy with a girl or a family member!

    Well, to get an impression of where I stand when I dismiss the musical aspects of this film, Fred and Ginger are, next to William Powell and Myrna Loy, the most watchable, most cinematic on-screen couple of the decadeurbane, witty, effortless. It is not their dancing together that impresses, not for me. Fred has done much better dancing in Easter Parade. The staging is most of the time uninteresting, spotlight on them, dull camera. And they are not what you would call superb actors by the contemporary sense of the term. It is the bubble of spontaneity and feigned amazement, the air of pleasant light friction they manage to sustain between them; a sense of soft clouds gliding against each other, the rain and lightning all for show. As said, the musical aspect doesn't touch me, it seems onedimensional give me the self-reflexive dance in layers of something like Busby's Footlight Parade. What IS interesting about this, and their cinematic coupling in general, is that it is so much more than a cocktail party, that would be William and Myrna's charm (do see The Thin Man if you haven't). It will seem superficial at first, indeed most viewers have dismissed the story as a trifle rehash of their Gay Divorc&eacute;e. It was probably seen as harmless at the time. The thing is basically a screwball with a few numbers. It probably excites me and not others, because my ongoing premise is that each film right down to the most crude, can be understood as a consciousness at the mercy of images it createsthe fun all in riding whims of perception as they enter the fray and stitch illusion. Let me unspool a bit of what goes on in the story to illustrate that. You have two lovers who curiously explore each other. We know they are destined, audiences knew then, it's as if they are already together and all this is being reflected back on. The place is Venice, the Hollywood studio versionthe perfect scenery for embellishment and dreamlike digress, because it is so falsely idyllic. It really is an amazing set; imagine being a studio carpenter and going to work there every morning, what bliss.. Now as fate would have it, there is the misunderstanding (mistaken identity) and all it kicks off. This is mirrored in a friendly couple, where imagined adultery is actually real and comes to the surface. You have the Italian dressmaker and annoying manservant as comic relief, both of whom act roles at one point or other, incidentally both are celibates so without anchor. On a third level, you have both lovers fabricating a supposed shared memory from the past, with Fred's, here's the magic of the couple in full effect, slyly improvised on the spot on top of Ginger's. Fateful changing of selves; splintered, older version of the reality of the characters; and third parallel mirror in obviously fabricated memory about veiled sex, which is at the core of everything. In Fred's story, he supposedly met Ginger years ago in Paris, who was going then by Madeleine'Mad' in short. How can anyone who has intimately known Vertigo see this and not sit back? Can't we say that some things enter the vocabulary with such power, they transform in retrospect everything else. Oh, the abstraction is empty as we have it. This is a comedy, so we have too much control of the plot; there are whims in perception, but we are never lost. And all of it has been so deftly annotated since Vertigo and on, that there's nothing to take from it anymore, the next two or three steps have been taken. But there must have been a window, say no more than 10 years, when this really tickled the imagination.

    It is always a pleasure to watch Fred Astairs at his best. Someone once compared the Martini cocktail as Fred Astair in a glass.. so I fixed myself one to match this movie, the first zips were great but it all turned flat soon afterward. The first scene is very promising as we recognize an energetic Fred Astair in a &uml;silence&uml; gentlemen room in London, those first 5 minutes were worth the ambiance of a Fred Astair/Martini fan suddenly we're taken to the hotel scene and the first impressive tap dancing and the fantastic 30's sounds flow over, one more zip to my drink is welcome... until we're flashed by this &uml;3 stooges&uml; plot of mis-identification and hide and seek over different rooms. completely disappointed till the point of putting the rest of the Dry Gin back in the bottle till I get another Fred Astair movie... The sets are ridiculousy repetitive, all handed in same boring-to-eye colour and over crafted Greek style, no matter it was London or Venice, you can tell the same manifacture... the hide and seek in between the misencounters were silly repetitive in the gaps of the few great dancing scenes. Dancing Scene: great techniques and beautiful music arrangements, but would have worked more on separate film cuts for cinema pre-view entertainment, not a movie. Madge and Horace weird relationship is worthless to mention as props as any of the Greek decorations in the flat decorated rooms, almost annoyng. it is sad to acknowledge that this is just a pre-fab plot less long sketch to promote Fred Astaris and Ginger Rogers theatrical talents. not a real movie.

    Top Hat, made in 1935, was the fourth of ten films which Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together, and one of the most popular. Astaire plays Jerry Travers, an American in London, who falls for Dale Tremont (Rogers). However, due to a case of mistaken identity, Dale believes that Jerry is married  to Dale's friend Madge, no less  and ends their relationship, while at the same time trying to warn Madge (Helen Broderick), that her husband is a philanderer. The plot was never the focal point of any Astaire/Rogers movie (or indeed a lot of other musicals); it's basically there to tie the musical numbers together  and that's absolutely fine, because the plot here is wafer thin, with holes all over it. However, the film itself is a total joy to watch, from start to finish. There are a lot of comedic moments, due to the fantastical identity mix-ups, and also courtesy of the characters of Madge, Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Morton), who is in fact Madge's actual husband, and Horace's trusty valet Bates (Eric Blore). Erik Rhodes, as Alberto Beddini, fashion designer and potential rival for Dale's affections also provides many very funny moments, playing a similar character to the one he played in the early Astaire/Rogers pairing, A Gay Divorc&eacute;e. The dancing is, of course, sublime. I am actually more of a Gene Kelly fan, but there is no doubt that to watch Astaire dance is a wonderful experience. My favourite number was the one which caused him to first meet Dale, when his tap dancing in a hotel, in the room above hers, caused her to complain about the noise. The Cheek To Cheek dance was also beautiful and elegant (and the feathered dress that Rogers wore, caused some problems when it shed its feathers during the dance). I'm steadily working my way through the Astaire/Rogers film, and have now watched five. This and the screwball comedy/musical Carefree are my two favourites. Forget the plot holes, enjoy the laughs, and admire the beautiful, creative and elegant dancing  this is a gorgeous film, which remains as entertaining as ever, 77 years after it was initially released  a real treat!

    The partnership between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made sparks fly from their first appearance together in Flying Down to Rio, enough to spur RKO into funding a series of high profile movies for them to star in. But worthy as The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (1934) and Roberta (Spring 1935) are, it was not until Top Hat that the pair reached their peak. The cast and crew are almost identical to that of The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (the only significant change is the introduction of Irving Berlin as songwriter), and yet the earlier picture was like a mere dress rehearsal for this magnificent follow up. One thing that seems unusual about these Astaire-Rogers musicals is that, in almost all of them, you never once see the two of them kissing. The fact is they don't need to, because all the romantic interplay takes place through the dances. In spite of their age gap and general difference in background and temperament, what both Fred and Ginger had was an ability to put character into their dances, and an ability to seem "in tune" with each whatever the steps. Top Hat serves as a showcase for Astaire's tap dancing prowess, throwing some particularly elaborate moves in the title number, even working his cane into the routine as a third foot. Of the two, Rogers was actually the better at acting. Look at her face as Fred begins to sing "Isn't it a Lovely Day". She is turned away from Astaire, but her expressions show her gradually softening feelings towards him, and when the two get up to dance it seems so natural. The ease with which the leads go into their dances is also enhanced by the direction of Mark Sandrich. Sandrich was really a master at finding ways of making a musical number segue neatly out of a scene. Astaire usually insisted on having his dancing exhibited in one unbroken take, but Sandrich goes one better than that and makes even the dialogue that precedes a dance part of that long take. For "Isn't it a Lovely Day" the shot begins with a wide view on the gazebo, but the camera moves in as Fred gets closer to Ginger, before pulling out again to give them room for the dance. And even outside the songs, Sandrich is adding a rhythmic, lyrical touch to proceedings. He makes frequent use of sweeping and swooping camera movements, from the dolly in on the word "silence" in the opening scene, to the through-the-floorboards scan when Ginger first enters the movie, to the final pan as the couple dance off into the sunset. It's as if the whole movie is part of one smooth trick This being a musical, we should not underestimate the contribution of the music itself. Irving Berlin had a marvellous quality that could make a simple song sound momentous. An example of his wonderful touch is that grand, sweeping minor key passage during the instrumental section of "Cheek to Cheek". But let's also not forget the part played by arranger Max Steiner. These were still relatively early days for scoring of sound films. Up until about 1933 most movies just had a little music over the credits, a fanfare at the end, and nothing else. Steiner however weaves Berlin's melodies into a living, functioning soundtrack. Just like Sandrich, he helps to make the tunes part of the narrative, such as the way the "No Strings" melody comes and goes along with Astaire's "dance attacks". So what is really clear about Top Hat is that everyone  writers, musicians, technical crew, supporting cast (honourable mentions to Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and Eric Rhodes; it's nice to see Blore and Horton as effectively a couple here, as they make a great double act themselves) and of course Fred and Ginger  are all in step with each other. This is Hollywood teamwork at its finest  creative professionals all giving their best for a common goal. It's wonderful.

    Ginger Rogers glorious and gorgeous was said to have done everything her great co star Fred Astaire did but in high heels and dance backwards. Ginger in her later years hated that comparison but seeing Mark Sandrich's brilliant film Top Hat one sees two great artists Astaire and Rogers at their peak. I can rave forever re this film and the great performances of the two classic Stars and also the brilliant set design. Filmed at RKO, the sets are wondrous and set a peak for artistic and interior design not only in Films but in decors worldwide. The canals of water, a set on a sound stage are remarkable. Ginger Rogers flawlessly beautiful in some of the greatest gowns of the era is what being a movie star is all about. Sexy Great Star. Bravo to RKO, Sandwich, Astaire and Ms Rogers. David Barra

    The dancer Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) meets his friend and producer Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton) at the conservative Thackeray Club in London and Horace invites Jerry to spend the night in his hotel. Jerry is excited with the show and has a "dance attack", tap dancing in the room and disturbing the guest Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) that is lodged in the room below. Dale goes upstairs to complain against the noise and meets Jerry and they flirt with each other. On the next morning, Dale mistakes the single Jerry for the married Horace and becomes upset with her flirtation. When she learns that Horace is the husband of her friend Helen Broderick (Madge Hardwick), there are many complications and confusions in the lives of the two friends. "Top Hat" is another wonderful film from the Golden Age of Hollywood, with delightful confusion and musical numbers. The gags are very funny and the song "Cheek to Cheek" was nominated to the 1936 Oscar in the category Best Music, Original Song. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Picolino"

    Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire were as important to the American Screen as any of their peers possibly more so. During the Depression these two great artists performed some of the greatest romantic sequences in movie history and did it with flair and honesty. Ms. Rogers deserves extra credit for her being as glamorously beautiful as any women of her era. These films were shot at RKO Studio and the fabled RKO Art Direction and Set Direction Departments invented Art Deco Interior Decoration worldwide. This is movie making at its finest and kudos to two legends, two stars who deserve all the praise they ever got, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. They are simply and will always be and totally The Tops!

    It is always a pleasure to watch Fred Astairs at his best. Someone once compared the Martini cocktail as Fred Astair in a glass.. so I fixed myself one to match this movie, the first zips were great but it all turned flat soon afterward. The first scene is very promising as we recognize an energetic Fred Astair in a &uml;silence&uml; gentlemen room in London, those first 5 minutes were worth the ambiance of a Fred Astair/Martini fan suddenly we're taken to the hotel scene and the first impressive tap dancing and the fantastic 30's sounds flow over, one more zip to my drink is welcome... until we're flashed by this &uml;3 stooges&uml; plot of mis-identification and hide and seek over different rooms. completely disappointed till the point of putting the rest of the Dry Gin back in the bottle till I get another Fred Astair movie... The sets are ridiculousy repetitive, all handed in same boring-to-eye colour and over crafted Greek style, no matter it was London or Venice, you can tell the same manifacture... the hide and seek in between the misencounters were silly repetitive in the gaps of the few great dancing scenes. Dancing Scene: great techniques and beautiful music arrangements, but would have worked more on separate film cuts for cinema pre-view entertainment, not a movie. Madge and Horace weird relationship is worthless to mention as props as any of the Greek decorations in the flat decorated rooms, almost annoyng. it is sad to acknowledge that this is just a pre-fab plot less long sketch to promote Fred Astaris and Ginger Rogers theatrical talents. not a real movie.

    Top Hat, made in 1935, was the fourth of ten films which Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together, and one of the most popular. Astaire plays Jerry Travers, an American in London, who falls for Dale Tremont (Rogers). However, due to a case of mistaken identity, Dale believes that Jerry is married  to Dale's friend Madge, no less  and ends their relationship, while at the same time trying to warn Madge (Helen Broderick), that her husband is a philanderer. The plot was never the focal point of any Astaire/Rogers movie (or indeed a lot of other musicals); it's basically there to tie the musical numbers together  and that's absolutely fine, because the plot here is wafer thin, with holes all over it. However, the film itself is a total joy to watch, from start to finish. There are a lot of comedic moments, due to the fantastical identity mix-ups, and also courtesy of the characters of Madge, Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Morton), who is in fact Madge's actual husband, and Horace's trusty valet Bates (Eric Blore). Erik Rhodes, as Alberto Beddini, fashion designer and potential rival for Dale's affections also provides many very funny moments, playing a similar character to the one he played in the early Astaire/Rogers pairing, A Gay Divorc&eacute;e. The dancing is, of course, sublime. I am actually more of a Gene Kelly fan, but there is no doubt that to watch Astaire dance is a wonderful experience. My favourite number was the one which caused him to first meet Dale, when his tap dancing in a hotel, in the room above hers, caused her to complain about the noise. The Cheek To Cheek dance was also beautiful and elegant (and the feathered dress that Rogers wore, caused some problems when it shed its feathers during the dance). I'm steadily working my way through the Astaire/Rogers film, and have now watched five. This and the screwball comedy/musical Carefree are my two favourites. Forget the plot holes, enjoy the laughs, and admire the beautiful, creative and elegant dancing  this is a gorgeous film, which remains as entertaining as ever, 77 years after it was initially released  a real treat!

    The partnership between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made sparks fly from their first appearance together in Flying Down to Rio, enough to spur RKO into funding a series of high profile movies for them to star in. But worthy as The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (1934) and Roberta (Spring 1935) are, it was not until Top Hat that the pair reached their peak. The cast and crew are almost identical to that of The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (the only significant change is the introduction of Irving Berlin as songwriter), and yet the earlier picture was like a mere dress rehearsal for this magnificent follow up. One thing that seems unusual about these Astaire-Rogers musicals is that, in almost all of them, you never once see the two of them kissing. The fact is they don't need to, because all the romantic interplay takes place through the dances. In spite of their age gap and general difference in background and temperament, what both Fred and Ginger had was an ability to put character into their dances, and an ability to seem "in tune" with each whatever the steps. Top Hat serves as a showcase for Astaire's tap dancing prowess, throwing some particularly elaborate moves in the title number, even working his cane into the routine as a third foot. Of the two, Rogers was actually the better at acting. Look at her face as Fred begins to sing "Isn't it a Lovely Day". She is turned away from Astaire, but her expressions show her gradually softening feelings towards him, and when the two get up to dance it seems so natural. The ease with which the leads go into their dances is also enhanced by the direction of Mark Sandrich. Sandrich was really a master at finding ways of making a musical number segue neatly out of a scene. Astaire usually insisted on having his dancing exhibited in one unbroken take, but Sandrich goes one better than that and makes even the dialogue that precedes a dance part of that long take. For "Isn't it a Lovely Day" the shot begins with a wide view on the gazebo, but the camera moves in as Fred gets closer to Ginger, before pulling out again to give them room for the dance. And even outside the songs, Sandrich is adding a rhythmic, lyrical touch to proceedings. He makes frequent use of sweeping and swooping camera movements, from the dolly in on the word "silence" in the opening scene, to the through-the-floorboards scan when Ginger first enters the movie, to the final pan as the couple dance off into the sunset. It's as if the whole movie is part of one smooth trick This being a musical, we should not underestimate the contribution of the music itself. Irving Berlin had a marvellous quality that could make a simple song sound momentous. An example of his wonderful touch is that grand, sweeping minor key passage during the instrumental section of "Cheek to Cheek". But let's also not forget the part played by arranger Max Steiner. These were still relatively early days for scoring of sound films. Up until about 1933 most movies just had a little music over the credits, a fanfare at the end, and nothing else. Steiner however weaves Berlin's melodies into a living, functioning soundtrack. Just like Sandrich, he helps to make the tunes part of the narrative, such as the way the "No Strings" melody comes and goes along with Astaire's "dance attacks". So what is really clear about Top Hat is that everyone  writers, musicians, technical crew, supporting cast (honourable mentions to Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and Eric Rhodes; it's nice to see Blore and Horton as effectively a couple here, as they make a great double act themselves) and of course Fred and Ginger  are all in step with each other. This is Hollywood teamwork at its finest  creative professionals all giving their best for a common goal. It's wonderful.

    Ginger Rogers glorious and gorgeous was said to have done everything her great co star Fred Astaire did but in high heels and dance backwards. Ginger in her later years hated that comparison but seeing Mark Sandrich's brilliant film Top Hat one sees two great artists Astaire and Rogers at their peak. I can rave forever re this film and the great performances of the two classic Stars and also the brilliant set design. Filmed at RKO, the sets are wondrous and set a peak for artistic and interior design not only in Films but in decors worldwide. The canals of water, a set on a sound stage are remarkable. Ginger Rogers flawlessly beautiful in some of the greatest gowns of the era is what being a movie star is all about. Sexy Great Star. Bravo to RKO, Sandwich, Astaire and Ms Rogers. David Barra

    The dancer Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) meets his friend and producer Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton) at the conservative Thackeray Club in London and Horace invites Jerry to spend the night in his hotel. Jerry is excited with the show and has a "dance attack", tap dancing in the room and disturbing the guest Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) that is lodged in the room below. Dale goes upstairs to complain against the noise and meets Jerry and they flirt with each other. On the next morning, Dale mistakes the single Jerry for the married Horace and becomes upset with her flirtation. When she learns that Horace is the husband of her friend Helen Broderick (Madge Hardwick), there are many complications and confusions in the lives of the two friends. "Top Hat" is another wonderful film from the Golden Age of Hollywood, with delightful confusion and musical numbers. The gags are very funny and the song "Cheek to Cheek" was nominated to the 1936 Oscar in the category Best Music, Original Song. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Picolino"

    Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire were as important to the American Screen as any of their peers possibly more so. During the Depression these two great artists performed some of the greatest romantic sequences in movie history and did it with flair and honesty. Ms. Rogers deserves extra credit for her being as glamorously beautiful as any women of her era. These films were shot at RKO Studio and the fabled RKO Art Direction and Set Direction Departments invented Art Deco Interior Decoration worldwide. This is movie making at its finest and kudos to two legends, two stars who deserve all the praise they ever got, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. They are simply and will always be and totally The Tops!

    Frankly, while Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had wonderfully chemistry, I don't feel the Astaire/Rogers films were his best movies. Band Wagon, for one, was much better, and in terms of dance partners, Eleanor Powell was much more impressive than Rogers. Still, I watched all the Astaire/Rogers films when I was in college, and I enjoyed them, less for the dancing (I really like Astaire best in his novelty numbers, like dancing with a coat rack or firecrackers) than with the goofy comedy of supporting players like Edward Everett Horton. Top Hat is a very good example of the Astaire Rogers formula. Astaire and Rogers coo and snipe, supporting players are amusingly befuddled, the story is an amusing though remarkably dopey comedy of errors, and there is quite a lot of dancing. The songs by Irving Berlin are some of his best, and the dancing is, of course, excellent, even though I'm really more a fan of Gene Kelly's earthier approach. If you like Astaire/Rogers movies, you'll like this one. If you've never seen one, this is a good place to start. I don't consider it a great movie by any means, but it is consistently entertaining.

    If there was one film that comes to mind when thinking of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers it would be Top Hat. And it is easy to see why because it is a wonderful film, whether as a musical, comedy or a timeless and unsurpassed partnership. The story isn't its strongest asset, some may argue that it's the story that they remember the least about Top Hat and a lot of Fred and Ginger's other outings. However that doesn't matter all that much, because it still has a fantastical fun element and told with a lot of charm and warmth. And because everything here just works amazingly well. The art-d&eacute;cor settings are very sumptuous, with costumes that are equally stunning(some of Ginger Rogers' dresses have to be seen to be believed) and handsome photography. Irving Berlin's score and songs are some of the best of any 30s-50s film musical, the witty lyrics, charming melodies and distinctive style is just a joy to listen to throughout. Top Hat, White Tie and Tails is a very catchy title number and really allows Fred Astaire to make it his own, while Isn't It a Lovely Day is one of Berlin's most beautiful songs and Cheek to Cheek has some of the best choreography of any single song of any Fred and Ginger film. Piccolino also comes across very well, Ginger's singing isn't a wow factor but the song itself and the lively choreography do win you over. The songs are helped by the choreography, which is glamorous, good-natured and looks so light-as-a-feather when Fred and Ginger do it. The dialogue is very witty and warm-hearted, the highlights were the hansom-cab scene and anything involving Beddini. The characters are eccentric but immensely likable, it's very easy to warm to and relate to Jerry. And there's no going wrong with the performances either, Fred and Ginger's dance partnership is deservedly iconic, you just admire and sometimes envy how poised and athletic they both are, and their individual performances are just as charming, especially Astaire. The supporting cast sparkle just as much, especially Erik Rhodes who steals every scene he's in and even at times the whole film. In conclusion, a Fred and Ginger classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This film will leave you screaming and dancing with delight! This film seriously reeks with class. Fred Astaire's character and Ginger Rodger's character are both extremely likable and cool. The dancing is truly amazing, you will suddenly feel very jealous of Mr Astaire after watching this movie. He makes everything look so easy when he dances. His voice seems really silky and soft when he sings and there is one Tap Dancing scene which will leave your tongue hanging out from your mouth. I must say first that this film is light. Don't bring your notebook out and start writing notes on the themes and ideas expressed through the movie, because you won't enjoy it. The plot is slight and over all a bit of nonsense. But it seems to take itself super seriously, but that, I think, is all part of the fun. There are only a few characters, they seem to breakthrough the stereotypes which is good. The art Deco style of London and the beauty of Venice is captured perfectly and I do get distracted sometimes by the background! I must say this, that this film is old. So, the camera shots are simpler, the acting isn't in your face and the film may feel a little slow, but this is part of the charm. There are only a handful of songs, sung by Astaire and Ginger, but they a good songs, including Cheek to Cheek and Top Hat, White tie and Tails. Great popcorn movie to enjoy with a girl or a family member!

    Well, to get an impression of where I stand when I dismiss the musical aspects of this film, Fred and Ginger are, next to William Powell and Myrna Loy, the most watchable, most cinematic on-screen couple of the decadeurbane, witty, effortless. It is not their dancing together that impresses, not for me. Fred has done much better dancing in Easter Parade. The staging is most of the time uninteresting, spotlight on them, dull camera. And they are not what you would call superb actors by the contemporary sense of the term. It is the bubble of spontaneity and feigned amazement, the air of pleasant light friction they manage to sustain between them; a sense of soft clouds gliding against each other, the rain and lightning all for show. As said, the musical aspect doesn't touch me, it seems onedimensional give me the self-reflexive dance in layers of something like Busby's Footlight Parade. What IS interesting about this, and their cinematic coupling in general, is that it is so much more than a cocktail party, that would be William and Myrna's charm (do see The Thin Man if you haven't). It will seem superficial at first, indeed most viewers have dismissed the story as a trifle rehash of their Gay Divorc&eacute;e. It was probably seen as harmless at the time. The thing is basically a screwball with a few numbers. It probably excites me and not others, because my ongoing premise is that each film right down to the most crude, can be understood as a consciousness at the mercy of images it createsthe fun all in riding whims of perception as they enter the fray and stitch illusion. Let me unspool a bit of what goes on in the story to illustrate that. You have two lovers who curiously explore each other. We know they are destined, audiences knew then, it's as if they are already together and all this is being reflected back on. The place is Venice, the Hollywood studio versionthe perfect scenery for embellishment and dreamlike digress, because it is so falsely idyllic. It really is an amazing set; imagine being a studio carpenter and going to work there every morning, what bliss.. Now as fate would have it, there is the misunderstanding (mistaken identity) and all it kicks off. This is mirrored in a friendly couple, where imagined adultery is actually real and comes to the surface. You have the Italian dressmaker and annoying manservant as comic relief, both of whom act roles at one point or other, incidentally both are celibates so without anchor. On a third level, you have both lovers fabricating a supposed shared memory from the past, with Fred's, here's the magic of the couple in full effect, slyly improvised on the spot on top of Ginger's. Fateful changing of selves; splintered, older version of the reality of the characters; and third parallel mirror in obviously fabricated memory about veiled sex, which is at the core of everything. In Fred's story, he supposedly met Ginger years ago in Paris, who was going then by Madeleine'Mad' in short. How can anyone who has intimately known Vertigo see this and not sit back? Can't we say that some things enter the vocabulary with such power, they transform in retrospect everything else. Oh, the abstraction is empty as we have it. This is a comedy, so we have too much control of the plot; there are whims in perception, but we are never lost. And all of it has been so deftly annotated since Vertigo and on, that there's nothing to take from it anymore, the next two or three steps have been taken. But there must have been a window, say no more than 10 years, when this really tickled the imagination.

    Frankly, while Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had wonderfully chemistry, I don't feel the Astaire/Rogers films were his best movies. Band Wagon, for one, was much better, and in terms of dance partners, Eleanor Powell was much more impressive than Rogers. Still, I watched all the Astaire/Rogers films when I was in college, and I enjoyed them, less for the dancing (I really like Astaire best in his novelty numbers, like dancing with a coat rack or firecrackers) than with the goofy comedy of supporting players like Edward Everett Horton. Top Hat is a very good example of the Astaire Rogers formula. Astaire and Rogers coo and snipe, supporting players are amusingly befuddled, the story is an amusing though remarkably dopey comedy of errors, and there is quite a lot of dancing. The songs by Irving Berlin are some of his best, and the dancing is, of course, excellent, even though I'm really more a fan of Gene Kelly's earthier approach. If you like Astaire/Rogers movies, you'll like this one. If you've never seen one, this is a good place to start. I don't consider it a great movie by any means, but it is consistently entertaining.

    If there was one film that comes to mind when thinking of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers it would be Top Hat. And it is easy to see why because it is a wonderful film, whether as a musical, comedy or a timeless and unsurpassed partnership. The story isn't its strongest asset, some may argue that it's the story that they remember the least about Top Hat and a lot of Fred and Ginger's other outings. However that doesn't matter all that much, because it still has a fantastical fun element and told with a lot of charm and warmth. And because everything here just works amazingly well. The art-d&eacute;cor settings are very sumptuous, with costumes that are equally stunning(some of Ginger Rogers' dresses have to be seen to be believed) and handsome photography. Irving Berlin's score and songs are some of the best of any 30s-50s film musical, the witty lyrics, charming melodies and distinctive style is just a joy to listen to throughout. Top Hat, White Tie and Tails is a very catchy title number and really allows Fred Astaire to make it his own, while Isn't It a Lovely Day is one of Berlin's most beautiful songs and Cheek to Cheek has some of the best choreography of any single song of any Fred and Ginger film. Piccolino also comes across very well, Ginger's singing isn't a wow factor but the song itself and the lively choreography do win you over. The songs are helped by the choreography, which is glamorous, good-natured and looks so light-as-a-feather when Fred and Ginger do it. The dialogue is very witty and warm-hearted, the highlights were the hansom-cab scene and anything involving Beddini. The characters are eccentric but immensely likable, it's very easy to warm to and relate to Jerry. And there's no going wrong with the performances either, Fred and Ginger's dance partnership is deservedly iconic, you just admire and sometimes envy how poised and athletic they both are, and their individual performances are just as charming, especially Astaire. The supporting cast sparkle just as much, especially Erik Rhodes who steals every scene he's in and even at times the whole film. In conclusion, a Fred and Ginger classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This film will leave you screaming and dancing with delight! This film seriously reeks with class. Fred Astaire's character and Ginger Rodger's character are both extremely likable and cool. The dancing is truly amazing, you will suddenly feel very jealous of Mr Astaire after watching this movie. He makes everything look so easy when he dances. His voice seems really silky and soft when he sings and there is one Tap Dancing scene which will leave your tongue hanging out from your mouth. I must say first that this film is light. Don't bring your notebook out and start writing notes on the themes and ideas expressed through the movie, because you won't enjoy it. The plot is slight and over all a bit of nonsense. But it seems to take itself super seriously, but that, I think, is all part of the fun. There are only a few characters, they seem to breakthrough the stereotypes which is good. The art Deco style of London and the beauty of Venice is captured perfectly and I do get distracted sometimes by the background! I must say this, that this film is old. So, the camera shots are simpler, the acting isn't in your face and the film may feel a little slow, but this is part of the charm. There are only a handful of songs, sung by Astaire and Ginger, but they a good songs, including Cheek to Cheek and Top Hat, White tie and Tails. Great popcorn movie to enjoy with a girl or a family member!

    Well, to get an impression of where I stand when I dismiss the musical aspects of this film, Fred and Ginger are, next to William Powell and Myrna Loy, the most watchable, most cinematic on-screen couple of the decadeurbane, witty, effortless. It is not their dancing together that impresses, not for me. Fred has done much better dancing in Easter Parade. The staging is most of the time uninteresting, spotlight on them, dull camera. And they are not what you would call superb actors by the contemporary sense of the term. It is the bubble of spontaneity and feigned amazement, the air of pleasant light friction they manage to sustain between them; a sense of soft clouds gliding against each other, the rain and lightning all for show. As said, the musical aspect doesn't touch me, it seems onedimensional give me the self-reflexive dance in layers of something like Busby's Footlight Parade. What IS interesting about this, and their cinematic coupling in general, is that it is so much more than a cocktail party, that would be William and Myrna's charm (do see The Thin Man if you haven't). It will seem superficial at first, indeed most viewers have dismissed the story as a trifle rehash of their Gay Divorc&eacute;e. It was probably seen as harmless at the time. The thing is basically a screwball with a few numbers. It probably excites me and not others, because my ongoing premise is that each film right down to the most crude, can be understood as a consciousness at the mercy of images it createsthe fun all in riding whims of perception as they enter the fray and stitch illusion. Let me unspool a bit of what goes on in the story to illustrate that. You have two lovers who curiously explore each other. We know they are destined, audiences knew then, it's as if they are already together and all this is being reflected back on. The place is Venice, the Hollywood studio versionthe perfect scenery for embellishment and dreamlike digress, because it is so falsely idyllic. It really is an amazing set; imagine being a studio carpenter and going to work there every morning, what bliss.. Now as fate would have it, there is the misunderstanding (mistaken identity) and all it kicks off. This is mirrored in a friendly couple, where imagined adultery is actually real and comes to the surface. You have the Italian dressmaker and annoying manservant as comic relief, both of whom act roles at one point or other, incidentally both are celibates so without anchor. On a third level, you have both lovers fabricating a supposed shared memory from the past, with Fred's, here's the magic of the couple in full effect, slyly improvised on the spot on top of Ginger's. Fateful changing of selves; splintered, older version of the reality of the characters; and third parallel mirror in obviously fabricated memory about veiled sex, which is at the core of everything. In Fred's story, he supposedly met Ginger years ago in Paris, who was going then by Madeleine'Mad' in short. How can anyone who has intimately known Vertigo see this and not sit back? Can't we say that some things enter the vocabulary with such power, they transform in retrospect everything else. Oh, the abstraction is empty as we have it. This is a comedy, so we have too much control of the plot; there are whims in perception, but we are never lost. And all of it has been so deftly annotated since Vertigo and on, that there's nothing to take from it anymore, the next two or three steps have been taken. But there must have been a window, say no more than 10 years, when this really tickled the imagination.

    It is always a pleasure to watch Fred Astairs at his best. Someone once compared the Martini cocktail as Fred Astair in a glass.. so I fixed myself one to match this movie, the first zips were great but it all turned flat soon afterward. The first scene is very promising as we recognize an energetic Fred Astair in a &uml;silence&uml; gentlemen room in London, those first 5 minutes were worth the ambiance of a Fred Astair/Martini fan suddenly we're taken to the hotel scene and the first impressive tap dancing and the fantastic 30's sounds flow over, one more zip to my drink is welcome... until we're flashed by this &uml;3 stooges&uml; plot of mis-identification and hide and seek over different rooms. completely disappointed till the point of putting the rest of the Dry Gin back in the bottle till I get another Fred Astair movie... The sets are ridiculousy repetitive, all handed in same boring-to-eye colour and over crafted Greek style, no matter it was London or Venice, you can tell the same manifacture... the hide and seek in between the misencounters were silly repetitive in the gaps of the few great dancing scenes. Dancing Scene: great techniques and beautiful music arrangements, but would have worked more on separate film cuts for cinema pre-view entertainment, not a movie. Madge and Horace weird relationship is worthless to mention as props as any of the Greek decorations in the flat decorated rooms, almost annoyng. it is sad to acknowledge that this is just a pre-fab plot less long sketch to promote Fred Astaris and Ginger Rogers theatrical talents. not a real movie.

    Top Hat, made in 1935, was the fourth of ten films which Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together, and one of the most popular. Astaire plays Jerry Travers, an American in London, who falls for Dale Tremont (Rogers). However, due to a case of mistaken identity, Dale believes that Jerry is married  to Dale's friend Madge, no less  and ends their relationship, while at the same time trying to warn Madge (Helen Broderick), that her husband is a philanderer. The plot was never the focal point of any Astaire/Rogers movie (or indeed a lot of other musicals); it's basically there to tie the musical numbers together  and that's absolutely fine, because the plot here is wafer thin, with holes all over it. However, the film itself is a total joy to watch, from start to finish. There are a lot of comedic moments, due to the fantastical identity mix-ups, and also courtesy of the characters of Madge, Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Morton), who is in fact Madge's actual husband, and Horace's trusty valet Bates (Eric Blore). Erik Rhodes, as Alberto Beddini, fashion designer and potential rival for Dale's affections also provides many very funny moments, playing a similar character to the one he played in the early Astaire/Rogers pairing, A Gay Divorc&eacute;e. The dancing is, of course, sublime. I am actually more of a Gene Kelly fan, but there is no doubt that to watch Astaire dance is a wonderful experience. My favourite number was the one which caused him to first meet Dale, when his tap dancing in a hotel, in the room above hers, caused her to complain about the noise. The Cheek To Cheek dance was also beautiful and elegant (and the feathered dress that Rogers wore, caused some problems when it shed its feathers during the dance). I'm steadily working my way through the Astaire/Rogers film, and have now watched five. This and the screwball comedy/musical Carefree are my two favourites. Forget the plot holes, enjoy the laughs, and admire the beautiful, creative and elegant dancing  this is a gorgeous film, which remains as entertaining as ever, 77 years after it was initially released  a real treat!

    The partnership between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made sparks fly from their first appearance together in Flying Down to Rio, enough to spur RKO into funding a series of high profile movies for them to star in. But worthy as The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (1934) and Roberta (Spring 1935) are, it was not until Top Hat that the pair reached their peak. The cast and crew are almost identical to that of The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (the only significant change is the introduction of Irving Berlin as songwriter), and yet the earlier picture was like a mere dress rehearsal for this magnificent follow up. One thing that seems unusual about these Astaire-Rogers musicals is that, in almost all of them, you never once see the two of them kissing. The fact is they don't need to, because all the romantic interplay takes place through the dances. In spite of their age gap and general difference in background and temperament, what both Fred and Ginger had was an ability to put character into their dances, and an ability to seem "in tune" with each whatever the steps. Top Hat serves as a showcase for Astaire's tap dancing prowess, throwing some particularly elaborate moves in the title number, even working his cane into the routine as a third foot. Of the two, Rogers was actually the better at acting. Look at her face as Fred begins to sing "Isn't it a Lovely Day". She is turned away from Astaire, but her expressions show her gradually softening feelings towards him, and when the two get up to dance it seems so natural. The ease with which the leads go into their dances is also enhanced by the direction of Mark Sandrich. Sandrich was really a master at finding ways of making a musical number segue neatly out of a scene. Astaire usually insisted on having his dancing exhibited in one unbroken take, but Sandrich goes one better than that and makes even the dialogue that precedes a dance part of that long take. For "Isn't it a Lovely Day" the shot begins with a wide view on the gazebo, but the camera moves in as Fred gets closer to Ginger, before pulling out again to give them room for the dance. And even outside the songs, Sandrich is adding a rhythmic, lyrical touch to proceedings. He makes frequent use of sweeping and swooping camera movements, from the dolly in on the word "silence" in the opening scene, to the through-the-floorboards scan when Ginger first enters the movie, to the final pan as the couple dance off into the sunset. It's as if the whole movie is part of one smooth trick This being a musical, we should not underestimate the contribution of the music itself. Irving Berlin had a marvellous quality that could make a simple song sound momentous. An example of his wonderful touch is that grand, sweeping minor key passage during the instrumental section of "Cheek to Cheek". But let's also not forget the part played by arranger Max Steiner. These were still relatively early days for scoring of sound films. Up until about 1933 most movies just had a little music over the credits, a fanfare at the end, and nothing else. Steiner however weaves Berlin's melodies into a living, functioning soundtrack. Just like Sandrich, he helps to make the tunes part of the narrative, such as the way the "No Strings" melody comes and goes along with Astaire's "dance attacks". So what is really clear about Top Hat is that everyone  writers, musicians, technical crew, supporting cast (honourable mentions to Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and Eric Rhodes; it's nice to see Blore and Horton as effectively a couple here, as they make a great double act themselves) and of course Fred and Ginger  are all in step with each other. This is Hollywood teamwork at its finest  creative professionals all giving their best for a common goal. It's wonderful.

    Ginger Rogers glorious and gorgeous was said to have done everything her great co star Fred Astaire did but in high heels and dance backwards. Ginger in her later years hated that comparison but seeing Mark Sandrich's brilliant film Top Hat one sees two great artists Astaire and Rogers at their peak. I can rave forever re this film and the great performances of the two classic Stars and also the brilliant set design. Filmed at RKO, the sets are wondrous and set a peak for artistic and interior design not only in Films but in decors worldwide. The canals of water, a set on a sound stage are remarkable. Ginger Rogers flawlessly beautiful in some of the greatest gowns of the era is what being a movie star is all about. Sexy Great Star. Bravo to RKO, Sandwich, Astaire and Ms Rogers. David Barra

    The dancer Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) meets his friend and producer Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton) at the conservative Thackeray Club in London and Horace invites Jerry to spend the night in his hotel. Jerry is excited with the show and has a "dance attack", tap dancing in the room and disturbing the guest Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) that is lodged in the room below. Dale goes upstairs to complain against the noise and meets Jerry and they flirt with each other. On the next morning, Dale mistakes the single Jerry for the married Horace and becomes upset with her flirtation. When she learns that Horace is the husband of her friend Helen Broderick (Madge Hardwick), there are many complications and confusions in the lives of the two friends. "Top Hat" is another wonderful film from the Golden Age of Hollywood, with delightful confusion and musical numbers. The gags are very funny and the song "Cheek to Cheek" was nominated to the 1936 Oscar in the category Best Music, Original Song. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Picolino"

    Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire were as important to the American Screen as any of their peers possibly more so. During the Depression these two great artists performed some of the greatest romantic sequences in movie history and did it with flair and honesty. Ms. Rogers deserves extra credit for her being as glamorously beautiful as any women of her era. These films were shot at RKO Studio and the fabled RKO Art Direction and Set Direction Departments invented Art Deco Interior Decoration worldwide. This is movie making at its finest and kudos to two legends, two stars who deserve all the praise they ever got, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. They are simply and will always be and totally The Tops!

    Top Hat, made in 1935, was the fourth of ten films which Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together, and one of the most popular. Astaire plays Jerry Travers, an American in London, who falls for Dale Tremont (Rogers). However, due to a case of mistaken identity, Dale believes that Jerry is married  to Dale's friend Madge, no less  and ends their relationship, while at the same time trying to warn Madge (Helen Broderick), that her husband is a philanderer. The plot was never the focal point of any Astaire/Rogers movie (or indeed a lot of other musicals); it's basically there to tie the musical numbers together  and that's absolutely fine, because the plot here is wafer thin, with holes all over it. However, the film itself is a total joy to watch, from start to finish. There are a lot of comedic moments, due to the fantastical identity mix-ups, and also courtesy of the characters of Madge, Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Morton), who is in fact Madge's actual husband, and Horace's trusty valet Bates (Eric Blore). Erik Rhodes, as Alberto Beddini, fashion designer and potential rival for Dale's affections also provides many very funny moments, playing a similar character to the one he played in the early Astaire/Rogers pairing, A Gay Divorc&eacute;e. The dancing is, of course, sublime. I am actually more of a Gene Kelly fan, but there is no doubt that to watch Astaire dance is a wonderful experience. My favourite number was the one which caused him to first meet Dale, when his tap dancing in a hotel, in the room above hers, caused her to complain about the noise. The Cheek To Cheek dance was also beautiful and elegant (and the feathered dress that Rogers wore, caused some problems when it shed its feathers during the dance). I'm steadily working my way through the Astaire/Rogers film, and have now watched five. This and the screwball comedy/musical Carefree are my two favourites. Forget the plot holes, enjoy the laughs, and admire the beautiful, creative and elegant dancing  this is a gorgeous film, which remains as entertaining as ever, 77 years after it was initially released  a real treat!

    The partnership between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made sparks fly from their first appearance together in Flying Down to Rio, enough to spur RKO into funding a series of high profile movies for them to star in. But worthy as The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (1934) and Roberta (Spring 1935) are, it was not until Top Hat that the pair reached their peak. The cast and crew are almost identical to that of The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (the only significant change is the introduction of Irving Berlin as songwriter), and yet the earlier picture was like a mere dress rehearsal for this magnificent follow up. One thing that seems unusual about these Astaire-Rogers musicals is that, in almost all of them, you never once see the two of them kissing. The fact is they don't need to, because all the romantic interplay takes place through the dances. In spite of their age gap and general difference in background and temperament, what both Fred and Ginger had was an ability to put character into their dances, and an ability to seem "in tune" with each whatever the steps. Top Hat serves as a showcase for Astaire's tap dancing prowess, throwing some particularly elaborate moves in the title number, even working his cane into the routine as a third foot. Of the two, Rogers was actually the better at acting. Look at her face as Fred begins to sing "Isn't it a Lovely Day". She is turned away from Astaire, but her expressions show her gradually softening feelings towards him, and when the two get up to dance it seems so natural. The ease with which the leads go into their dances is also enhanced by the direction of Mark Sandrich. Sandrich was really a master at finding ways of making a musical number segue neatly out of a scene. Astaire usually insisted on having his dancing exhibited in one unbroken take, but Sandrich goes one better than that and makes even the dialogue that precedes a dance part of that long take. For "Isn't it a Lovely Day" the shot begins with a wide view on the gazebo, but the camera moves in as Fred gets closer to Ginger, before pulling out again to give them room for the dance. And even outside the songs, Sandrich is adding a rhythmic, lyrical touch to proceedings. He makes frequent use of sweeping and swooping camera movements, from the dolly in on the word "silence" in the opening scene, to the through-the-floorboards scan when Ginger first enters the movie, to the final pan as the couple dance off into the sunset. It's as if the whole movie is part of one smooth trick This being a musical, we should not underestimate the contribution of the music itself. Irving Berlin had a marvellous quality that could make a simple song sound momentous. An example of his wonderful touch is that grand, sweeping minor key passage during the instrumental section of "Cheek to Cheek". But let's also not forget the part played by arranger Max Steiner. These were still relatively early days for scoring of sound films. Up until about 1933 most movies just had a little music over the credits, a fanfare at the end, and nothing else. Steiner however weaves Berlin's melodies into a living, functioning soundtrack. Just like Sandrich, he helps to make the tunes part of the narrative, such as the way the "No Strings" melody comes and goes along with Astaire's "dance attacks". So what is really clear about Top Hat is that everyone  writers, musicians, technical crew, supporting cast (honourable mentions to Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and Eric Rhodes; it's nice to see Blore and Horton as effectively a couple here, as they make a great double act themselves) and of course Fred and Ginger  are all in step with each other. This is Hollywood teamwork at its finest  creative professionals all giving their best for a common goal. It's wonderful.

    Ginger Rogers glorious and gorgeous was said to have done everything her great co star Fred Astaire did but in high heels and dance backwards. Ginger in her later years hated that comparison but seeing Mark Sandrich's brilliant film Top Hat one sees two great artists Astaire and Rogers at their peak. I can rave forever re this film and the great performances of the two classic Stars and also the brilliant set design. Filmed at RKO, the sets are wondrous and set a peak for artistic and interior design not only in Films but in decors worldwide. The canals of water, a set on a sound stage are remarkable. Ginger Rogers flawlessly beautiful in some of the greatest gowns of the era is what being a movie star is all about. Sexy Great Star. Bravo to RKO, Sandwich, Astaire and Ms Rogers. David Barra

    The dancer Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) meets his friend and producer Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton) at the conservative Thackeray Club in London and Horace invites Jerry to spend the night in his hotel. Jerry is excited with the show and has a "dance attack", tap dancing in the room and disturbing the guest Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) that is lodged in the room below. Dale goes upstairs to complain against the noise and meets Jerry and they flirt with each other. On the next morning, Dale mistakes the single Jerry for the married Horace and becomes upset with her flirtation. When she learns that Horace is the husband of her friend Helen Broderick (Madge Hardwick), there are many complications and confusions in the lives of the two friends. "Top Hat" is another wonderful film from the Golden Age of Hollywood, with delightful confusion and musical numbers. The gags are very funny and the song "Cheek to Cheek" was nominated to the 1936 Oscar in the category Best Music, Original Song. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Picolino"

    Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire were as important to the American Screen as any of their peers possibly more so. During the Depression these two great artists performed some of the greatest romantic sequences in movie history and did it with flair and honesty. Ms. Rogers deserves extra credit for her being as glamorously beautiful as any women of her era. These films were shot at RKO Studio and the fabled RKO Art Direction and Set Direction Departments invented Art Deco Interior Decoration worldwide. This is movie making at its finest and kudos to two legends, two stars who deserve all the praise they ever got, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. They are simply and will always be and totally The Tops!

    Frankly, while Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had wonderfully chemistry, I don't feel the Astaire/Rogers films were his best movies. Band Wagon, for one, was much better, and in terms of dance partners, Eleanor Powell was much more impressive than Rogers. Still, I watched all the Astaire/Rogers films when I was in college, and I enjoyed them, less for the dancing (I really like Astaire best in his novelty numbers, like dancing with a coat rack or firecrackers) than with the goofy comedy of supporting players like Edward Everett Horton. Top Hat is a very good example of the Astaire Rogers formula. Astaire and Rogers coo and snipe, supporting players are amusingly befuddled, the story is an amusing though remarkably dopey comedy of errors, and there is quite a lot of dancing. The songs by Irving Berlin are some of his best, and the dancing is, of course, excellent, even though I'm really more a fan of Gene Kelly's earthier approach. If you like Astaire/Rogers movies, you'll like this one. If you've never seen one, this is a good place to start. I don't consider it a great movie by any means, but it is consistently entertaining.

    If there was one film that comes to mind when thinking of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers it would be Top Hat. And it is easy to see why because it is a wonderful film, whether as a musical, comedy or a timeless and unsurpassed partnership. The story isn't its strongest asset, some may argue that it's the story that they remember the least about Top Hat and a lot of Fred and Ginger's other outings. However that doesn't matter all that much, because it still has a fantastical fun element and told with a lot of charm and warmth. And because everything here just works amazingly well. The art-d&eacute;cor settings are very sumptuous, with costumes that are equally stunning(some of Ginger Rogers' dresses have to be seen to be believed) and handsome photography. Irving Berlin's score and songs are some of the best of any 30s-50s film musical, the witty lyrics, charming melodies and distinctive style is just a joy to listen to throughout. Top Hat, White Tie and Tails is a very catchy title number and really allows Fred Astaire to make it his own, while Isn't It a Lovely Day is one of Berlin's most beautiful songs and Cheek to Cheek has some of the best choreography of any single song of any Fred and Ginger film. Piccolino also comes across very well, Ginger's singing isn't a wow factor but the song itself and the lively choreography do win you over. The songs are helped by the choreography, which is glamorous, good-natured and looks so light-as-a-feather when Fred and Ginger do it. The dialogue is very witty and warm-hearted, the highlights were the hansom-cab scene and anything involving Beddini. The characters are eccentric but immensely likable, it's very easy to warm to and relate to Jerry. And there's no going wrong with the performances either, Fred and Ginger's dance partnership is deservedly iconic, you just admire and sometimes envy how poised and athletic they both are, and their individual performances are just as charming, especially Astaire. The supporting cast sparkle just as much, especially Erik Rhodes who steals every scene he's in and even at times the whole film. In conclusion, a Fred and Ginger classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This film will leave you screaming and dancing with delight! This film seriously reeks with class. Fred Astaire's character and Ginger Rodger's character are both extremely likable and cool. The dancing is truly amazing, you will suddenly feel very jealous of Mr Astaire after watching this movie. He makes everything look so easy when he dances. His voice seems really silky and soft when he sings and there is one Tap Dancing scene which will leave your tongue hanging out from your mouth. I must say first that this film is light. Don't bring your notebook out and start writing notes on the themes and ideas expressed through the movie, because you won't enjoy it. The plot is slight and over all a bit of nonsense. But it seems to take itself super seriously, but that, I think, is all part of the fun. There are only a few characters, they seem to breakthrough the stereotypes which is good. The art Deco style of London and the beauty of Venice is captured perfectly and I do get distracted sometimes by the background! I must say this, that this film is old. So, the camera shots are simpler, the acting isn't in your face and the film may feel a little slow, but this is part of the charm. There are only a handful of songs, sung by Astaire and Ginger, but they a good songs, including Cheek to Cheek and Top Hat, White tie and Tails. Great popcorn movie to enjoy with a girl or a family member!

    Well, to get an impression of where I stand when I dismiss the musical aspects of this film, Fred and Ginger are, next to William Powell and Myrna Loy, the most watchable, most cinematic on-screen couple of the decadeurbane, witty, effortless. It is not their dancing together that impresses, not for me. Fred has done much better dancing in Easter Parade. The staging is most of the time uninteresting, spotlight on them, dull camera. And they are not what you would call superb actors by the contemporary sense of the term. It is the bubble of spontaneity and feigned amazement, the air of pleasant light friction they manage to sustain between them; a sense of soft clouds gliding against each other, the rain and lightning all for show. As said, the musical aspect doesn't touch me, it seems onedimensional give me the self-reflexive dance in layers of something like Busby's Footlight Parade. What IS interesting about this, and their cinematic coupling in general, is that it is so much more than a cocktail party, that would be William and Myrna's charm (do see The Thin Man if you haven't). It will seem superficial at first, indeed most viewers have dismissed the story as a trifle rehash of their Gay Divorc&eacute;e. It was probably seen as harmless at the time. The thing is basically a screwball with a few numbers. It probably excites me and not others, because my ongoing premise is that each film right down to the most crude, can be understood as a consciousness at the mercy of images it createsthe fun all in riding whims of perception as they enter the fray and stitch illusion. Let me unspool a bit of what goes on in the story to illustrate that. You have two lovers who curiously explore each other. We know they are destined, audiences knew then, it's as if they are already together and all this is being reflected back on. The place is Venice, the Hollywood studio versionthe perfect scenery for embellishment and dreamlike digress, because it is so falsely idyllic. It really is an amazing set; imagine being a studio carpenter and going to work there every morning, what bliss.. Now as fate would have it, there is the misunderstanding (mistaken identity) and all it kicks off. This is mirrored in a friendly couple, where imagined adultery is actually real and comes to the surface. You have the Italian dressmaker and annoying manservant as comic relief, both of whom act roles at one point or other, incidentally both are celibates so without anchor. On a third level, you have both lovers fabricating a supposed shared memory from the past, with Fred's, here's the magic of the couple in full effect, slyly improvised on the spot on top of Ginger's. Fateful changing of selves; splintered, older version of the reality of the characters; and third parallel mirror in obviously fabricated memory about veiled sex, which is at the core of everything. In Fred's story, he supposedly met Ginger years ago in Paris, who was going then by Madeleine'Mad' in short. How can anyone who has intimately known Vertigo see this and not sit back? Can't we say that some things enter the vocabulary with such power, they transform in retrospect everything else. Oh, the abstraction is empty as we have it. This is a comedy, so we have too much control of the plot; there are whims in perception, but we are never lost. And all of it has been so deftly annotated since Vertigo and on, that there's nothing to take from it anymore, the next two or three steps have been taken. But there must have been a window, say no more than 10 years, when this really tickled the imagination.

    It is always a pleasure to watch Fred Astairs at his best. Someone once compared the Martini cocktail as Fred Astair in a glass.. so I fixed myself one to match this movie, the first zips were great but it all turned flat soon afterward. The first scene is very promising as we recognize an energetic Fred Astair in a &uml;silence&uml; gentlemen room in London, those first 5 minutes were worth the ambiance of a Fred Astair/Martini fan suddenly we're taken to the hotel scene and the first impressive tap dancing and the fantastic 30's sounds flow over, one more zip to my drink is welcome... until we're flashed by this &uml;3 stooges&uml; plot of mis-identification and hide and seek over different rooms. completely disappointed till the point of putting the rest of the Dry Gin back in the bottle till I get another Fred Astair movie... The sets are ridiculousy repetitive, all handed in same boring-to-eye colour and over crafted Greek style, no matter it was London or Venice, you can tell the same manifacture... the hide and seek in between the misencounters were silly repetitive in the gaps of the few great dancing scenes. Dancing Scene: great techniques and beautiful music arrangements, but would have worked more on separate film cuts for cinema pre-view entertainment, not a movie. Madge and Horace weird relationship is worthless to mention as props as any of the Greek decorations in the flat decorated rooms, almost annoyng. it is sad to acknowledge that this is just a pre-fab plot less long sketch to promote Fred Astaris and Ginger Rogers theatrical talents. not a real movie.

    If there was one film that comes to mind when thinking of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers it would be Top Hat. And it is easy to see why because it is a wonderful film, whether as a musical, comedy or a timeless and unsurpassed partnership. The story isn't its strongest asset, some may argue that it's the story that they remember the least about Top Hat and a lot of Fred and Ginger's other outings. However that doesn't matter all that much, because it still has a fantastical fun element and told with a lot of charm and warmth. And because everything here just works amazingly well. The art-d&eacute;cor settings are very sumptuous, with costumes that are equally stunning(some of Ginger Rogers' dresses have to be seen to be believed) and handsome photography. Irving Berlin's score and songs are some of the best of any 30s-50s film musical, the witty lyrics, charming melodies and distinctive style is just a joy to listen to throughout. Top Hat, White Tie and Tails is a very catchy title number and really allows Fred Astaire to make it his own, while Isn't It a Lovely Day is one of Berlin's most beautiful songs and Cheek to Cheek has some of the best choreography of any single song of any Fred and Ginger film. Piccolino also comes across very well, Ginger's singing isn't a wow factor but the song itself and the lively choreography do win you over. The songs are helped by the choreography, which is glamorous, good-natured and looks so light-as-a-feather when Fred and Ginger do it. The dialogue is very witty and warm-hearted, the highlights were the hansom-cab scene and anything involving Beddini. The characters are eccentric but immensely likable, it's very easy to warm to and relate to Jerry. And there's no going wrong with the performances either, Fred and Ginger's dance partnership is deservedly iconic, you just admire and sometimes envy how poised and athletic they both are, and their individual performances are just as charming, especially Astaire. The supporting cast sparkle just as much, especially Erik Rhodes who steals every scene he's in and even at times the whole film. In conclusion, a Fred and Ginger classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This film will leave you screaming and dancing with delight! This film seriously reeks with class. Fred Astaire's character and Ginger Rodger's character are both extremely likable and cool. The dancing is truly amazing, you will suddenly feel very jealous of Mr Astaire after watching this movie. He makes everything look so easy when he dances. His voice seems really silky and soft when he sings and there is one Tap Dancing scene which will leave your tongue hanging out from your mouth. I must say first that this film is light. Don't bring your notebook out and start writing notes on the themes and ideas expressed through the movie, because you won't enjoy it. The plot is slight and over all a bit of nonsense. But it seems to take itself super seriously, but that, I think, is all part of the fun. There are only a few characters, they seem to breakthrough the stereotypes which is good. The art Deco style of London and the beauty of Venice is captured perfectly and I do get distracted sometimes by the background! I must say this, that this film is old. So, the camera shots are simpler, the acting isn't in your face and the film may feel a little slow, but this is part of the charm. There are only a handful of songs, sung by Astaire and Ginger, but they a good songs, including Cheek to Cheek and Top Hat, White tie and Tails. Great popcorn movie to enjoy with a girl or a family member!

    Well, to get an impression of where I stand when I dismiss the musical aspects of this film, Fred and Ginger are, next to William Powell and Myrna Loy, the most watchable, most cinematic on-screen couple of the decadeurbane, witty, effortless. It is not their dancing together that impresses, not for me. Fred has done much better dancing in Easter Parade. The staging is most of the time uninteresting, spotlight on them, dull camera. And they are not what you would call superb actors by the contemporary sense of the term. It is the bubble of spontaneity and feigned amazement, the air of pleasant light friction they manage to sustain between them; a sense of soft clouds gliding against each other, the rain and lightning all for show. As said, the musical aspect doesn't touch me, it seems onedimensional give me the self-reflexive dance in layers of something like Busby's Footlight Parade. What IS interesting about this, and their cinematic coupling in general, is that it is so much more than a cocktail party, that would be William and Myrna's charm (do see The Thin Man if you haven't). It will seem superficial at first, indeed most viewers have dismissed the story as a trifle rehash of their Gay Divorc&eacute;e. It was probably seen as harmless at the time. The thing is basically a screwball with a few numbers. It probably excites me and not others, because my ongoing premise is that each film right down to the most crude, can be understood as a consciousness at the mercy of images it createsthe fun all in riding whims of perception as they enter the fray and stitch illusion. Let me unspool a bit of what goes on in the story to illustrate that. You have two lovers who curiously explore each other. We know they are destined, audiences knew then, it's as if they are already together and all this is being reflected back on. The place is Venice, the Hollywood studio versionthe perfect scenery for embellishment and dreamlike digress, because it is so falsely idyllic. It really is an amazing set; imagine being a studio carpenter and going to work there every morning, what bliss.. Now as fate would have it, there is the misunderstanding (mistaken identity) and all it kicks off. This is mirrored in a friendly couple, where imagined adultery is actually real and comes to the surface. You have the Italian dressmaker and annoying manservant as comic relief, both of whom act roles at one point or other, incidentally both are celibates so without anchor. On a third level, you have both lovers fabricating a supposed shared memory from the past, with Fred's, here's the magic of the couple in full effect, slyly improvised on the spot on top of Ginger's. Fateful changing of selves; splintered, older version of the reality of the characters; and third parallel mirror in obviously fabricated memory about veiled sex, which is at the core of everything. In Fred's story, he supposedly met Ginger years ago in Paris, who was going then by Madeleine'Mad' in short. How can anyone who has intimately known Vertigo see this and not sit back? Can't we say that some things enter the vocabulary with such power, they transform in retrospect everything else. Oh, the abstraction is empty as we have it. This is a comedy, so we have too much control of the plot; there are whims in perception, but we are never lost. And all of it has been so deftly annotated since Vertigo and on, that there's nothing to take from it anymore, the next two or three steps have been taken. But there must have been a window, say no more than 10 years, when this really tickled the imagination.

    It is always a pleasure to watch Fred Astairs at his best. Someone once compared the Martini cocktail as Fred Astair in a glass.. so I fixed myself one to match this movie, the first zips were great but it all turned flat soon afterward. The first scene is very promising as we recognize an energetic Fred Astair in a &uml;silence&uml; gentlemen room in London, those first 5 minutes were worth the ambiance of a Fred Astair/Martini fan suddenly we're taken to the hotel scene and the first impressive tap dancing and the fantastic 30's sounds flow over, one more zip to my drink is welcome... until we're flashed by this &uml;3 stooges&uml; plot of mis-identification and hide and seek over different rooms. completely disappointed till the point of putting the rest of the Dry Gin back in the bottle till I get another Fred Astair movie... The sets are ridiculousy repetitive, all handed in same boring-to-eye colour and over crafted Greek style, no matter it was London or Venice, you can tell the same manifacture... the hide and seek in between the misencounters were silly repetitive in the gaps of the few great dancing scenes. Dancing Scene: great techniques and beautiful music arrangements, but would have worked more on separate film cuts for cinema pre-view entertainment, not a movie. Madge and Horace weird relationship is worthless to mention as props as any of the Greek decorations in the flat decorated rooms, almost annoyng. it is sad to acknowledge that this is just a pre-fab plot less long sketch to promote Fred Astaris and Ginger Rogers theatrical talents. not a real movie.

    Top Hat, made in 1935, was the fourth of ten films which Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together, and one of the most popular. Astaire plays Jerry Travers, an American in London, who falls for Dale Tremont (Rogers). However, due to a case of mistaken identity, Dale believes that Jerry is married  to Dale's friend Madge, no less  and ends their relationship, while at the same time trying to warn Madge (Helen Broderick), that her husband is a philanderer. The plot was never the focal point of any Astaire/Rogers movie (or indeed a lot of other musicals); it's basically there to tie the musical numbers together  and that's absolutely fine, because the plot here is wafer thin, with holes all over it. However, the film itself is a total joy to watch, from start to finish. There are a lot of comedic moments, due to the fantastical identity mix-ups, and also courtesy of the characters of Madge, Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Morton), who is in fact Madge's actual husband, and Horace's trusty valet Bates (Eric Blore). Erik Rhodes, as Alberto Beddini, fashion designer and potential rival for Dale's affections also provides many very funny moments, playing a similar character to the one he played in the early Astaire/Rogers pairing, A Gay Divorc&eacute;e. The dancing is, of course, sublime. I am actually more of a Gene Kelly fan, but there is no doubt that to watch Astaire dance is a wonderful experience. My favourite number was the one which caused him to first meet Dale, when his tap dancing in a hotel, in the room above hers, caused her to complain about the noise. The Cheek To Cheek dance was also beautiful and elegant (and the feathered dress that Rogers wore, caused some problems when it shed its feathers during the dance). I'm steadily working my way through the Astaire/Rogers film, and have now watched five. This and the screwball comedy/musical Carefree are my two favourites. Forget the plot holes, enjoy the laughs, and admire the beautiful, creative and elegant dancing  this is a gorgeous film, which remains as entertaining as ever, 77 years after it was initially released  a real treat!

    The partnership between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made sparks fly from their first appearance together in Flying Down to Rio, enough to spur RKO into funding a series of high profile movies for them to star in. But worthy as The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (1934) and Roberta (Spring 1935) are, it was not until Top Hat that the pair reached their peak. The cast and crew are almost identical to that of The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (the only significant change is the introduction of Irving Berlin as songwriter), and yet the earlier picture was like a mere dress rehearsal for this magnificent follow up. One thing that seems unusual about these Astaire-Rogers musicals is that, in almost all of them, you never once see the two of them kissing. The fact is they don't need to, because all the romantic interplay takes place through the dances. In spite of their age gap and general difference in background and temperament, what both Fred and Ginger had was an ability to put character into their dances, and an ability to seem "in tune" with each whatever the steps. Top Hat serves as a showcase for Astaire's tap dancing prowess, throwing some particularly elaborate moves in the title number, even working his cane into the routine as a third foot. Of the two, Rogers was actually the better at acting. Look at her face as Fred begins to sing "Isn't it a Lovely Day". She is turned away from Astaire, but her expressions show her gradually softening feelings towards him, and when the two get up to dance it seems so natural. The ease with which the leads go into their dances is also enhanced by the direction of Mark Sandrich. Sandrich was really a master at finding ways of making a musical number segue neatly out of a scene. Astaire usually insisted on having his dancing exhibited in one unbroken take, but Sandrich goes one better than that and makes even the dialogue that precedes a dance part of that long take. For "Isn't it a Lovely Day" the shot begins with a wide view on the gazebo, but the camera moves in as Fred gets closer to Ginger, before pulling out again to give them room for the dance. And even outside the songs, Sandrich is adding a rhythmic, lyrical touch to proceedings. He makes frequent use of sweeping and swooping camera movements, from the dolly in on the word "silence" in the opening scene, to the through-the-floorboards scan when Ginger first enters the movie, to the final pan as the couple dance off into the sunset. It's as if the whole movie is part of one smooth trick This being a musical, we should not underestimate the contribution of the music itself. Irving Berlin had a marvellous quality that could make a simple song sound momentous. An example of his wonderful touch is that grand, sweeping minor key passage during the instrumental section of "Cheek to Cheek". But let's also not forget the part played by arranger Max Steiner. These were still relatively early days for scoring of sound films. Up until about 1933 most movies just had a little music over the credits, a fanfare at the end, and nothing else. Steiner however weaves Berlin's melodies into a living, functioning soundtrack. Just like Sandrich, he helps to make the tunes part of the narrative, such as the way the "No Strings" melody comes and goes along with Astaire's "dance attacks". So what is really clear about Top Hat is that everyone  writers, musicians, technical crew, supporting cast (honourable mentions to Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and Eric Rhodes; it's nice to see Blore and Horton as effectively a couple here, as they make a great double act themselves) and of course Fred and Ginger  are all in step with each other. This is Hollywood teamwork at its finest  creative professionals all giving their best for a common goal. It's wonderful.

    Ginger Rogers glorious and gorgeous was said to have done everything her great co star Fred Astaire did but in high heels and dance backwards. Ginger in her later years hated that comparison but seeing Mark Sandrich's brilliant film Top Hat one sees two great artists Astaire and Rogers at their peak. I can rave forever re this film and the great performances of the two classic Stars and also the brilliant set design. Filmed at RKO, the sets are wondrous and set a peak for artistic and interior design not only in Films but in decors worldwide. The canals of water, a set on a sound stage are remarkable. Ginger Rogers flawlessly beautiful in some of the greatest gowns of the era is what being a movie star is all about. Sexy Great Star. Bravo to RKO, Sandwich, Astaire and Ms Rogers. David Barra

    The dancer Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) meets his friend and producer Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton) at the conservative Thackeray Club in London and Horace invites Jerry to spend the night in his hotel. Jerry is excited with the show and has a "dance attack", tap dancing in the room and disturbing the guest Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) that is lodged in the room below. Dale goes upstairs to complain against the noise and meets Jerry and they flirt with each other. On the next morning, Dale mistakes the single Jerry for the married Horace and becomes upset with her flirtation. When she learns that Horace is the husband of her friend Helen Broderick (Madge Hardwick), there are many complications and confusions in the lives of the two friends. "Top Hat" is another wonderful film from the Golden Age of Hollywood, with delightful confusion and musical numbers. The gags are very funny and the song "Cheek to Cheek" was nominated to the 1936 Oscar in the category Best Music, Original Song. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Picolino"

    Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire were as important to the American Screen as any of their peers possibly more so. During the Depression these two great artists performed some of the greatest romantic sequences in movie history and did it with flair and honesty. Ms. Rogers deserves extra credit for her being as glamorously beautiful as any women of her era. These films were shot at RKO Studio and the fabled RKO Art Direction and Set Direction Departments invented Art Deco Interior Decoration worldwide. This is movie making at its finest and kudos to two legends, two stars who deserve all the praise they ever got, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. They are simply and will always be and totally The Tops!

    Frankly, while Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had wonderfully chemistry, I don't feel the Astaire/Rogers films were his best movies. Band Wagon, for one, was much better, and in terms of dance partners, Eleanor Powell was much more impressive than Rogers. Still, I watched all the Astaire/Rogers films when I was in college, and I enjoyed them, less for the dancing (I really like Astaire best in his novelty numbers, like dancing with a coat rack or firecrackers) than with the goofy comedy of supporting players like Edward Everett Horton. Top Hat is a very good example of the Astaire Rogers formula. Astaire and Rogers coo and snipe, supporting players are amusingly befuddled, the story is an amusing though remarkably dopey comedy of errors, and there is quite a lot of dancing. The songs by Irving Berlin are some of his best, and the dancing is, of course, excellent, even though I'm really more a fan of Gene Kelly's earthier approach. If you like Astaire/Rogers movies, you'll like this one. If you've never seen one, this is a good place to start. I don't consider it a great movie by any means, but it is consistently entertaining.

I'm steadily working my way through the Astaire/Rogers film, and have now watched five. This and the screwball comedy/musical Carefree are my two favourites. Forget the plot holes, enjoy the laughs, and admire the beautiful, creative and elegant dancing  this is a gorgeous film, which remains as entertaining as ever, 77 years after it was initially released  a real treat!

    The partnership between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made sparks fly from their first appearance together in Flying Down to Rio, enough to spur RKO into funding a series of high profile movies for them to star in. But worthy as The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (1934) and Roberta (Spring 1935) are, it was not until Top Hat that the pair reached their peak. The cast and crew are almost identical to that of The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (the only significant change is the introduction of Irving Berlin as songwriter), and yet the earlier picture was like a mere dress rehearsal for this magnificent follow up. One thing that seems unusual about these Astaire-Rogers musicals is that, in almost all of them, you never once see the two of them kissing. The fact is they don't need to, because all the romantic interplay takes place through the dances. In spite of their age gap and general difference in background and temperament, what both Fred and Ginger had was an ability to put character into their dances, and an ability to seem "in tune" with each whatever the steps. Top Hat serves as a showcase for Astaire's tap dancing prowess, throwing some particularly elaborate moves in the title number, even working his cane into the routine as a third foot. Of the two, Rogers was actually the better at acting. Look at her face as Fred begins to sing "Isn't it a Lovely Day". She is turned away from Astaire, but her expressions show her gradually softening feelings towards him, and when the two get up to dance it seems so natural. The ease with which the leads go into their dances is also enhanced by the direction of Mark Sandrich. Sandrich was really a master at finding ways of making a musical number segue neatly out of a scene. Astaire usually insisted on having his dancing exhibited in one unbroken take, but Sandrich goes one better than that and makes even the dialogue that precedes a dance part of that long take. For "Isn't it a Lovely Day" the shot begins with a wide view on the gazebo, but the camera moves in as Fred gets closer to Ginger, before pulling out again to give them room for the dance. And even outside the songs, Sandrich is adding a rhythmic, lyrical touch to proceedings. He makes frequent use of sweeping and swooping camera movements, from the dolly in on the word "silence" in the opening scene, to the through-the-floorboards scan when Ginger first enters the movie, to the final pan as the couple dance off into the sunset. It's as if the whole movie is part of one smooth trick This being a musical, we should not underestimate the contribution of the music itself. Irving Berlin had a marvellous quality that could make a simple song sound momentous. An example of his wonderful touch is that grand, sweeping minor key passage during the instrumental section of "Cheek to Cheek". But let's also not forget the part played by arranger Max Steiner. These were still relatively early days for scoring of sound films. Up until about 1933 most movies just had a little music over the credits, a fanfare at the end, and nothing else. Steiner however weaves Berlin's melodies into a living, functioning soundtrack. Just like Sandrich, he helps to make the tunes part of the narrative, such as the way the "No Strings" melody comes and goes along with Astaire's "dance attacks". So what is really clear about Top Hat is that everyone  writers, musicians, technical crew, supporting cast (honourable mentions to Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and Eric Rhodes; it's nice to see Blore and Horton as effectively a couple here, as they make a great double act themselves) and of course Fred and Ginger  are all in step with each other. This is Hollywood teamwork at its finest  creative professionals all giving their best for a common goal. It's wonderful.

    Ginger Rogers glorious and gorgeous was said to have done everything her great co star Fred Astaire did but in high heels and dance backwards. Ginger in her later years hated that comparison but seeing Mark Sandrich's brilliant film Top Hat one sees two great artists Astaire and Rogers at their peak. I can rave forever re this film and the great performances of the two classic Stars and also the brilliant set design. Filmed at RKO, the sets are wondrous and set a peak for artistic and interior design not only in Films but in decors worldwide. The canals of water, a set on a sound stage are remarkable. Ginger Rogers flawlessly beautiful in some of the greatest gowns of the era is what being a movie star is all about. Sexy Great Star. Bravo to RKO, Sandwich, Astaire and Ms Rogers. David Barra

    The dancer Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) meets his friend and producer Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton) at the conservative Thackeray Club in London and Horace invites Jerry to spend the night in his hotel. Jerry is excited with the show and has a "dance attack", tap dancing in the room and disturbing the guest Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) that is lodged in the room below. Dale goes upstairs to complain against the noise and meets Jerry and they flirt with each other. On the next morning, Dale mistakes the single Jerry for the married Horace and becomes upset with her flirtation. When she learns that Horace is the husband of her friend Helen Broderick (Madge Hardwick), there are many complications and confusions in the lives of the two friends. "Top Hat" is another wonderful film from the Golden Age of Hollywood, with delightful confusion and musical numbers. The gags are very funny and the song "Cheek to Cheek" was nominated to the 1936 Oscar in the category Best Music, Original Song. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Picolino"

    Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire were as important to the American Screen as any of their peers possibly more so. During the Depression these two great artists performed some of the greatest romantic sequences in movie history and did it with flair and honesty. Ms. Rogers deserves extra credit for her being as glamorously beautiful as any women of her era. These films were shot at RKO Studio and the fabled RKO Art Direction and Set Direction Departments invented Art Deco Interior Decoration worldwide. This is movie making at its finest and kudos to two legends, two stars who deserve all the praise they ever got, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. They are simply and will always be and totally The Tops!

    Frankly, while Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had wonderfully chemistry, I don't feel the Astaire/Rogers films were his best movies. Band Wagon, for one, was much better, and in terms of dance partners, Eleanor Powell was much more impressive than Rogers. Still, I watched all the Astaire/Rogers films when I was in college, and I enjoyed them, less for the dancing (I really like Astaire best in his novelty numbers, like dancing with a coat rack or firecrackers) than with the goofy comedy of supporting players like Edward Everett Horton. Top Hat is a very good example of the Astaire Rogers formula. Astaire and Rogers coo and snipe, supporting players are amusingly befuddled, the story is an amusing though remarkably dopey comedy of errors, and there is quite a lot of dancing. The songs by Irving Berlin are some of his best, and the dancing is, of course, excellent, even though I'm really more a fan of Gene Kelly's earthier approach. If you like Astaire/Rogers movies, you'll like this one. If you've never seen one, this is a good place to start. I don't consider it a great movie by any means, but it is consistently entertaining.

    If there was one film that comes to mind when thinking of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers it would be Top Hat. And it is easy to see why because it is a wonderful film, whether as a musical, comedy or a timeless and unsurpassed partnership. The story isn't its strongest asset, some may argue that it's the story that they remember the least about Top Hat and a lot of Fred and Ginger's other outings. However that doesn't matter all that much, because it still has a fantastical fun element and told with a lot of charm and warmth. And because everything here just works amazingly well. The art-d&eacute;cor settings are very sumptuous, with costumes that are equally stunning(some of Ginger Rogers' dresses have to be seen to be believed) and handsome photography. Irving Berlin's score and songs are some of the best of any 30s-50s film musical, the witty lyrics, charming melodies and distinctive style is just a joy to listen to throughout. Top Hat, White Tie and Tails is a very catchy title number and really allows Fred Astaire to make it his own, while Isn't It a Lovely Day is one of Berlin's most beautiful songs and Cheek to Cheek has some of the best choreography of any single song of any Fred and Ginger film. Piccolino also comes across very well, Ginger's singing isn't a wow factor but the song itself and the lively choreography do win you over. The songs are helped by the choreography, which is glamorous, good-natured and looks so light-as-a-feather when Fred and Ginger do it. The dialogue is very witty and warm-hearted, the highlights were the hansom-cab scene and anything involving Beddini. The characters are eccentric but immensely likable, it's very easy to warm to and relate to Jerry. And there's no going wrong with the performances either, Fred and Ginger's dance partnership is deservedly iconic, you just admire and sometimes envy how poised and athletic they both are, and their individual performances are just as charming, especially Astaire. The supporting cast sparkle just as much, especially Erik Rhodes who steals every scene he's in and even at times the whole film. In conclusion, a Fred and Ginger classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This film will leave you screaming and dancing with delight! This film seriously reeks with class. Fred Astaire's character and Ginger Rodger's character are both extremely likable and cool. The dancing is truly amazing, you will suddenly feel very jealous of Mr Astaire after watching this movie. He makes everything look so easy when he dances. His voice seems really silky and soft when he sings and there is one Tap Dancing scene which will leave your tongue hanging out from your mouth. I must say first that this film is light. Don't bring your notebook out and start writing notes on the themes and ideas expressed through the movie, because you won't enjoy it. The plot is slight and over all a bit of nonsense. But it seems to take itself super seriously, but that, I think, is all part of the fun. There are only a few characters, they seem to breakthrough the stereotypes which is good. The art Deco style of London and the beauty of Venice is captured perfectly and I do get distracted sometimes by the background! I must say this, that this film is old. So, the camera shots are simpler, the acting isn't in your face and the film may feel a little slow, but this is part of the charm. There are only a handful of songs, sung by Astaire and Ginger, but they a good songs, including Cheek to Cheek and Top Hat, White tie and Tails. Great popcorn movie to enjoy with a girl or a family member!

    Well, to get an impression of where I stand when I dismiss the musical aspects of this film, Fred and Ginger are, next to William Powell and Myrna Loy, the most watchable, most cinematic on-screen couple of the decadeurbane, witty, effortless. It is not their dancing together that impresses, not for me. Fred has done much better dancing in Easter Parade. The staging is most of the time uninteresting, spotlight on them, dull camera. And they are not what you would call superb actors by the contemporary sense of the term. It is the bubble of spontaneity and feigned amazement, the air of pleasant light friction they manage to sustain between them; a sense of soft clouds gliding against each other, the rain and lightning all for show. As said, the musical aspect doesn't touch me, it seems onedimensional give me the self-reflexive dance in layers of something like Busby's Footlight Parade. What IS interesting about this, and their cinematic coupling in general, is that it is so much more than a cocktail party, that would be William and Myrna's charm (do see The Thin Man if you haven't). It will seem superficial at first, indeed most viewers have dismissed the story as a trifle rehash of their Gay Divorc&eacute;e. It was probably seen as harmless at the time. The thing is basically a screwball with a few numbers. It probably excites me and not others, because my ongoing premise is that each film right down to the most crude, can be understood as a consciousness at the mercy of images it createsthe fun all in riding whims of perception as they enter the fray and stitch illusion. Let me unspool a bit of what goes on in the story to illustrate that. You have two lovers who curiously explore each other. We know they are destined, audiences knew then, it's as if they are already together and all this is being reflected back on. The place is Venice, the Hollywood studio versionthe perfect scenery for embellishment and dreamlike digress, because it is so falsely idyllic. It really is an amazing set; imagine being a studio carpenter and going to work there every morning, what bliss.. Now as fate would have it, there is the misunderstanding (mistaken identity) and all it kicks off. This is mirrored in a friendly couple, where imagined adultery is actually real and comes to the surface. You have the Italian dressmaker and annoying manservant as comic relief, both of whom act roles at one point or other, incidentally both are celibates so without anchor. On a third level, you have both lovers fabricating a supposed shared memory from the past, with Fred's, here's the magic of the couple in full effect, slyly improvised on the spot on top of Ginger's. Fateful changing of selves; splintered, older version of the reality of the characters; and third parallel mirror in obviously fabricated memory about veiled sex, which is at the core of everything. In Fred's story, he supposedly met Ginger years ago in Paris, who was going then by Madeleine'Mad' in short. How can anyone who has intimately known Vertigo see this and not sit back? Can't we say that some things enter the vocabulary with such power, they transform in retrospect everything else. Oh, the abstraction is empty as we have it. This is a comedy, so we have too much control of the plot; there are whims in perception, but we are never lost. And all of it has been so deftly annotated since Vertigo and on, that there's nothing to take from it anymore, the next two or three steps have been taken. But there must have been a window, say no more than 10 years, when this really tickled the imagination.

    It is always a pleasure to watch Fred Astairs at his best. Someone once compared the Martini cocktail as Fred Astair in a glass.. so I fixed myself one to match this movie, the first zips were great but it all turned flat soon afterward. The first scene is very promising as we recognize an energetic Fred Astair in a &uml;silence&uml; gentlemen room in London, those first 5 minutes were worth the ambiance of a Fred Astair/Martini fan suddenly we're taken to the hotel scene and the first impressive tap dancing and the fantastic 30's sounds flow over, one more zip to my drink is welcome... until we're flashed by this &uml;3 stooges&uml; plot of mis-identification and hide and seek over different rooms. completely disappointed till the point of putting the rest of the Dry Gin back in the bottle till I get another Fred Astair movie... The sets are ridiculousy repetitive, all handed in same boring-to-eye colour and over crafted Greek style, no matter it was London or Venice, you can tell the same manifacture... the hide and seek in between the misencounters were silly repetitive in the gaps of the few great dancing scenes. Dancing Scene: great techniques and beautiful music arrangements, but would have worked more on separate film cuts for cinema pre-view entertainment, not a movie. Madge and Horace weird relationship is worthless to mention as props as any of the Greek decorations in the flat decorated rooms, almost annoyng. it is sad to acknowledge that this is just a pre-fab plot less long sketch to promote Fred Astaris and Ginger Rogers theatrical talents. not a real movie.

    Top Hat, made in 1935, was the fourth of ten films which Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together, and one of the most popular. Astaire plays Jerry Travers, an American in London, who falls for Dale Tremont (Rogers). However, due to a case of mistaken identity, Dale believes that Jerry is married  to Dale's friend Madge, no less  and ends their relationship, while at the same time trying to warn Madge (Helen Broderick), that her husband is a philanderer. The plot was never the focal point of any Astaire/Rogers movie (or indeed a lot of other musicals); it's basically there to tie the musical numbers together  and that's absolutely fine, because the plot here is wafer thin, with holes all over it. However, the film itself is a total joy to watch, from start to finish. There are a lot of comedic moments, due to the fantastical identity mix-ups, and also courtesy of the characters of Madge, Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Morton), who is in fact Madge's actual husband, and Horace's trusty valet Bates (Eric Blore). Erik Rhodes, as Alberto Beddini, fashion designer and potential rival for Dale's affections also provides many very funny moments, playing a similar character to the one he played in the early Astaire/Rogers pairing, A Gay Divorc&eacute;e. The dancing is, of course, sublime. I am actually more of a Gene Kelly fan, but there is no doubt that to watch Astaire dance is a wonderful experience. My favourite number was the one which caused him to first meet Dale, when his tap dancing in a hotel, in the room above hers, caused her to complain about the noise. The Cheek To Cheek dance was also beautiful and elegant (and the feathered dress that Rogers wore, caused some problems when it shed its feathers during the dance). I'm steadily working my way through the Astaire/Rogers film, and have now watched five. This and the screwball comedy/musical Carefree are my two favourites. Forget the plot holes, enjoy the laughs, and admire the beautiful, creative and elegant dancing  this is a gorgeous film, which remains as entertaining as ever, 77 years after it was initially released  a real treat!
