    It has often been said that once you love "Weird Science" you'll also like "Real Genius". And while I guess this is true, I really wouldn't place both movies into the same category an onto the same level. This is really a movie in the vain of other great, classic goofball '80's comedies, focusing on young students. Looking back at it, this really was the golden age for comedies and the lovers of the genre and time period will surely be able to appreciate this movie. And I can certainly appreciate this movie as well, for what it is. That doesn't mean that I can simply ignore all of its flaws and weaknesses as well though. The movie is fun but that is about all that the movie is. One of the things that I thought the movie was really lacking in was its story. And I'm not just talking about its main premise but more so about all of its developments, the way things progress and the characters. I guess part of this can also be blamed on the directing by Martha Coolidge, since the main premise itself remains still quite good and fun. I just could never really get involved with its story or its characters, which was a real shame, since this seemed to be what the movie was really pushing for. It wanted you to really love all of its characters and made some of them as goofy as possible. But really the only character that truly works out and becomes a greatly fun and memorable one is the Val Kilmer character. But this in itself is still enough to make the movie a real fun and entertaining one to watch! It makes it once more obvious what a waste it is that Val Kilmer never really broke through as a comedy actor and didn't do more movies like this during his career. Most people now days only known and recognize him for his serious movie roles. In this movie he looked almost as outrageous as he does now days and that is saying a lot! Val Kilmer his look has changed very drastically over the last couple of years and with change I mean his pretty extreme sudden weight gain, while he was once a true Hollywood heartthrob. The sort of 'childish' '80's teenage comedy approach is what makes the movie actually charming and in a way also irresistible to watch. It provides the movie with plenty of crazy situations, as well as some serious teenage issues, that still appeal and apply to teenagers this present day. This is also really what makes these genre movies from the '80's such timeless ones and are also really the reason why some of them are still being so popular to watch now days. I would exactly classify this movie as one of the classics- or best examples for its genre but it's definitely worth giving a go. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    In the late 60's-early 70's I was a math and physics geek dreaming and working at getting a scholarship to Caltech, the real university fictionalized in the film. The Vietnam War and a draft lottery number of 5 intervened so I wound up joining the Navy and actually working on WMDs as I hunted the Great Steel Whales. I must have seen this film 50 times over the years and it's always funny and fresh each time. Contrary to the opinions of many, The plot IS based on the true story of a Caltech grad student who invented the X-ray laser for eye surgery; only to have Edward Teller of the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Weapons Labs try to turn it into a space-based particle beam weapon for Reagan's Star Wars project. Many of the incidents depicted are taken directly from the hijinks Caltech students engage in during the annual Ditch Day celebrations. I won't rehash the plot since so many have already done so on these pages. Suffice to say that a great, funny, literate script, journeyman direction by Martha Coolidge and believable performances by Jarret, Kilmer, Atherton, Meyrink, et all put this film a cut above virtually all the other 80's school and nerd comedies. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was due to the somewhat cheesy special effects of the B1-B bomber used in the weapon's test. Ironically enough, I lived in Pasadena in the late 90's/early 00's and drove past Caltech every day on my way home from work. There I would periodically see busloads of Chinese tourists from the People's Republic taking each other's pictures in front of the Caltech administration building. I always wondered how many of THEM had seen this film and if seeing it would have changed their enthusiasm for the place.

    Today I was rumaging threw my movie collection and came across Real Genius and thought it would be the next perfect movie to review. Real genius is a saterical comedy staring Val Kilmer.Another movie I cought on HBO one Saturday morning that quickly became one of my favorites.Real Genius is about a 16 year old kid named Mitch (Gabe Jarret) which the only other movie I saw him in was Apollo 13. Mitch gets accepted to one of the best colleges in the country and is recruited to create a super lazer with the help of his dorm roommate one of the top brains and all around goofballs Chris (Val Kilmer) though they have no idea what it will be used for.While this is going on Mitch sees a man who's been living in their closet named Lazlo (Jonathan Gries who also played Napoleon Dynamites meat throwing uncle) Lazlo tells them that they might have just made a lazer that could be used for the military and they set up a plan to stop it.Does their plan work? you'll just have to see the movie to find out With a great cast and great 80's music from the likes of Tears for Fears,Bryan Adams and Don Henley this is definitely a movie to check out at least once although you wont wanna see it just once but I may just be saying that since I consider this my favorite movie. Since I really see nothing wrong with this movie i'll rate it five lazer beams out of five

    I remember seeing this movie many years ago and really enjoying it. So this year I watched it again and may I say, "Wow!". It was just as good as the first time I saw it many years ago. It was truly a huge blast of nostalgia. I truly did enjoy this movie, it's a reminder of how comedy should be these days. Also, Val Kilmer does a great job in this movie as " Chris Knight", definitely one of his best roles next to Iceman in "Top Gun". All in all, this is a great classic but, sadly forgotten 80s film, it's probably my favorite film of the 80s and definitely ranks in my Top 5 Favorite Films of All Time. Real Genius: 10/10

    There really is a difference between smart people and nerds. You can be smart and fun at the same time. You can be witty and someone socially desirable all at once. Getting good grades and doesn't necessarily sentence you to a life as a social pariah. Most of the characters we meet in Real Genius are not actually nerds. The Kent character would be an exception. But Real Genius is a fun and reasonably intelligent comedy with exceptionally smart people as its heroes. And unlike the protagonists in Revenge of the Nerds, they aren't people you'd necessarily make fun of. But you can certainly laugh at them. Real Genius is the story of a handful of whiz kids at mythical Pacific Tech University who are unwittingly being used to develop a deadly weapon for the CIA. It turns out their smarmy professor (William Atherton) is using a government grant to refurbish his home while his students relentlessly spend all of their waking moments in a lab developing a laser beam which can eradicate a human target from space. Gabe Jarret is a 15 yr old new to the team who finds himself roomed with Val Kilmer; a genius who has long ago decided not to take school so seriously. Jarret only wants to work on the laser and live up to the expectations of his parents and the faculty. Kilmer wants to teach the kid how to have some fun. And all the while this dangerous weapon is being created in their lab. Finally, after several plot complications, the weapon is complete. But it takes a former whiz kid living in the steam tunnels beneath the dorm to point out that this laser can really only have one use. Feeling betrayed, the students gang up on their professor and use his weapon to teach him a lesson. Real Genius is not a particularly plausible film in terms of its plot, but it succeeds at its most basic goal. In other words, its funny. Kilmer has never been better, spouting smug one-liners that would make Chevy Chase or Bill Murray smile. Atherton always got to play the creep back in the 1980s, and as usual he does it quite well. Gabe Jarret never did much else, but he's as good as he needs to be as the new "stud" who can hardly believe he's doing what he's doing at age 15. The film has dated fairly well. It has a good soundtrack, good special f/x for the laser, and good cast with several memorable performances. There are some unnecessary elements, such as the mixer with student beauticians, and perhaps Jarret's relationship with the hyper girl down the hall was tacked on. But overall its still a winner after so many years. Worth a rental if you don't own it already. 8 of 10 stars. The Hound

    We know how funny actor Val Kilmer could be after his debut performance in the comedy spoof "Top Secret", and the filmmakers here took that chance by giving the fresh faced actor one of central roles where he would truly make light work of his flamboyantly off-the-wall character. It's Kilmer's show and boy does he take control! Working off a bright and snappy script, Kilmer is let loose and brings much needed zip and a real quirkiness to his magnificently inspired performance. With "Real Genius" it was one of those films that passed me by, but when I noticed it I was expecting your basic ho-hum teen comedy, but while it might have the token characters and usual situations it actually had a fresh and clever spin to it all. Sure the chaotic and scatty slapstick/screwball humour might not always come off, but it never outstays its welcome by getting on with things as it was constantly thinking on its feet. When its spot on (either with it radical dialogues or visual gags --- as there's plenty of the latter), it's quite good. It even has a message to boot; no matter how hard you work, there's always time to take a break and enjoy life's many experiences or maybe be careful if you're super smart as the military might just abuse that gift. Yes, the plot follows that of Mitch Taylor a 15 year old whiz kid that joins a school of fellow scientific prodigies. There he meets Chris Knight, who likes to have a good time than be caught studying. However unknowingly to them their professor is exploiting them in an attempt to create a laser weapon for the military. A technically slick presentation by director Martha Coolidge who showers the air with punchy 80s tunes and gets a bunch of capable performances from the cast. William Atherton is picture-perfect as the smug professor and Gabriel Jarret brings the right quality to his na&iuml;ve character Mitch. Michelle Meyrink is adorably sweet as one of the students; Robert Prescott is good fun as a suck-up nerdy student and look out for Yuji Okumoto (who I'll always remember for his part in "Better off Dead") as one of the whizzes. Jon Gries is enjoyably dry and then you get the lovely ladies Patti D'Arbanville and Deborah Foreman in minor, but potent parts.

    This movie was terrible! Normally I love 80s movies, especially wacky, zany, or unique ones such as Better Off Dead, One Crazy Summer, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Real Genius falls into this wacky and zany category, but also falls into the obnoxious and not funny category. In this movie, a 15 year old genius boy with idiot parents gets into college at his young age, decides he can't take living there, decides he can take it after all, then it turns out he was involved in the creation of some super laser that can blast through anything. The plot was stupid and the jokes were all crude and not even funny. The movie was overall weird and had no charm. The genius kid also falls in love with a freak girl who never sleeps. This movie was lame and had crappy music and I regret ever watching it. Do yourself a favor and pick a different 80s comedy such as the ones I mentioned earlier.

    Written brilliantly by Neal Isra,Pat Proft & Peter Torokvei & Superbly Directed by Martha Coolidge comes a Cult Classic in true means, it's 'Real Genius'. A Mind-blowing Entertainer that has everything! 'Real Genius' is a story about 2-Geniuses mainly, who can create anything with their sharp-brains. Throwing a Beach Party in a auditorium complete with a lagoon and bikini-clad beauties. Or turn a dorm into am Ice-Skating rick, dismantle a nerd's car and reassemble it in his room... you ask anything, and these Geniuses have it. 'Real Genius' has a good-twist, with a secret weapon being invented... but more than that it's a full-on entertainer. A must see film! Acting wise, Val Kilmer is outstanding as a genius head. The Now Veteran-Actor is in terrific form. Gabriel Jarret is lovable as Mitch. It's sad to know that this talented actor didn't make many movies. Michelle Meyrink is excellent. So is Jon Gries as Lazlo. Robert Prescott does a oh-so-nerd act well. William Atherton is fine as the bad-guy. Watch this cult classic now...

    This movie brings back a lot of memories and it's one of Val Kilmer's most entertaining comedies. This movie belongs on the shelf beside the greatest classics: Back to the Future, The Goonies, Wargames, Weird Science, etc ... I'm not going to recap the movie or give my interpretation on the movie. Everything is relative. I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and I'm going to watch it right now (I'm 28 btw). Check it out. Val Kilmer does an amazing job in this movie. He's such a confident and amusing actor. If you're a fan of Val Kilmer as I am then you're going to enjoy this movie. I agree with the last comment made on this movie. I could watch this movie every day. Enjoy!

    While there were a lot of popular teen comedies from the 80's only a few really standout in retrospect, this film along with most of John Hughes work is amongst them. The story follows teenage prodigy Mitch who is recruited by the fictitious Pacific Tech University so that he might join other top young scientific minds bent on developing a powerful laser ostensibly to advance science but in reality to provide the military with a weapon for their arsenal. Mitch is played by Gabriel Jarret who is adequate in the role, while the supporting cast includes William Atherton (Die Hard, Ghostbusters) as the professor in charge and Michele Meyrink playing the hyperactive Jordan who becomes Mitch's love interest, Meyrink is very effective in her role but didn't have much of a career subsequently. The big star of the film though is Val Kilmer who plays Chris Knight who mentors the uptight Mitch both academically and socially. The films director is Martha Coolidge who seems to have had less success than her talent might have justified. The film offers an interesting portrayal of college campus life in the 1980's (at least) which seems for the most part far more accurate than other depictions. The film also covers the fairly common 1980's theme of a government conspiracy. In closing the film features a great choice of closing title music, at least for the 1980's with "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears.

With "Real Genius" it was one of those films that passed me by, but when I noticed it I was expecting your basic ho-hum teen comedy, but while it might have the token characters and usual situations it actually had a fresh and clever spin to it all. Sure the chaotic and scatty slapstick/screwball humour might not always come off, but it never outstays its welcome by getting on with things as it was constantly thinking on its feet. When its spot on (either with it radical dialogues or visual gags --- as there's plenty of the latter), it's quite good. It even has a message to boot; no matter how hard you work, there's always time to take a break and enjoy life's many experiences or maybe be careful if you're super smart as the military might just abuse that gift. Yes, the plot follows that of Mitch Taylor a 15 year old whiz kid that joins a school of fellow scientific prodigies. There he meets Chris Knight, who likes to have a good time than be caught studying. However unknowingly to them their professor is exploiting them in an attempt to create a laser weapon for the military. A technically slick presentation by director Martha Coolidge who showers the air with punchy 80s tunes and gets a bunch of capable performances from the cast. William Atherton is picture-perfect as the smug professor and Gabriel Jarret brings the right quality to his na&iuml;ve character Mitch. Michelle Meyrink is adorably sweet as one of the students; Robert Prescott is good fun as a suck-up nerdy student and look out for Yuji Okumoto (who I'll always remember for his part in "Better off Dead") as one of the whizzes. Jon Gries is enjoyably dry and then you get the lovely ladies Patti D'Arbanville and Deborah Foreman in minor, but potent parts.

    This movie was terrible! Normally I love 80s movies, especially wacky, zany, or unique ones such as Better Off Dead, One Crazy Summer, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Real Genius falls into this wacky and zany category, but also falls into the obnoxious and not funny category. In this movie, a 15 year old genius boy with idiot parents gets into college at his young age, decides he can't take living there, decides he can take it after all, then it turns out he was involved in the creation of some super laser that can blast through anything. The plot was stupid and the jokes were all crude and not even funny. The movie was overall weird and had no charm. The genius kid also falls in love with a freak girl who never sleeps. This movie was lame and had crappy music and I regret ever watching it. Do yourself a favor and pick a different 80s comedy such as the ones I mentioned earlier.

    Written brilliantly by Neal Isra,Pat Proft & Peter Torokvei & Superbly Directed by Martha Coolidge comes a Cult Classic in true means, it's 'Real Genius'. A Mind-blowing Entertainer that has everything! 'Real Genius' is a story about 2-Geniuses mainly, who can create anything with their sharp-brains. Throwing a Beach Party in a auditorium complete with a lagoon and bikini-clad beauties. Or turn a dorm into am Ice-Skating rick, dismantle a nerd's car and reassemble it in his room... you ask anything, and these Geniuses have it. 'Real Genius' has a good-twist, with a secret weapon being invented... but more than that it's a full-on entertainer. A must see film! Acting wise, Val Kilmer is outstanding as a genius head. The Now Veteran-Actor is in terrific form. Gabriel Jarret is lovable as Mitch. It's sad to know that this talented actor didn't make many movies. Michelle Meyrink is excellent. So is Jon Gries as Lazlo. Robert Prescott does a oh-so-nerd act well. William Atherton is fine as the bad-guy. Watch this cult classic now...

    This movie brings back a lot of memories and it's one of Val Kilmer's most entertaining comedies. This movie belongs on the shelf beside the greatest classics: Back to the Future, The Goonies, Wargames, Weird Science, etc ... I'm not going to recap the movie or give my interpretation on the movie. Everything is relative. I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and I'm going to watch it right now (I'm 28 btw). Check it out. Val Kilmer does an amazing job in this movie. He's such a confident and amusing actor. If you're a fan of Val Kilmer as I am then you're going to enjoy this movie. I agree with the last comment made on this movie. I could watch this movie every day. Enjoy!

    While there were a lot of popular teen comedies from the 80's only a few really standout in retrospect, this film along with most of John Hughes work is amongst them. The story follows teenage prodigy Mitch who is recruited by the fictitious Pacific Tech University so that he might join other top young scientific minds bent on developing a powerful laser ostensibly to advance science but in reality to provide the military with a weapon for their arsenal. Mitch is played by Gabriel Jarret who is adequate in the role, while the supporting cast includes William Atherton (Die Hard, Ghostbusters) as the professor in charge and Michele Meyrink playing the hyperactive Jordan who becomes Mitch's love interest, Meyrink is very effective in her role but didn't have much of a career subsequently. The big star of the film though is Val Kilmer who plays Chris Knight who mentors the uptight Mitch both academically and socially. The films director is Martha Coolidge who seems to have had less success than her talent might have justified. The film offers an interesting portrayal of college campus life in the 1980's (at least) which seems for the most part far more accurate than other depictions. The film also covers the fairly common 1980's theme of a government conspiracy. In closing the film features a great choice of closing title music, at least for the 1980's with "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears.

    It has often been said that once you love "Weird Science" you'll also like "Real Genius". And while I guess this is true, I really wouldn't place both movies into the same category an onto the same level. This is really a movie in the vain of other great, classic goofball '80's comedies, focusing on young students. Looking back at it, this really was the golden age for comedies and the lovers of the genre and time period will surely be able to appreciate this movie. And I can certainly appreciate this movie as well, for what it is. That doesn't mean that I can simply ignore all of its flaws and weaknesses as well though. The movie is fun but that is about all that the movie is. One of the things that I thought the movie was really lacking in was its story. And I'm not just talking about its main premise but more so about all of its developments, the way things progress and the characters. I guess part of this can also be blamed on the directing by Martha Coolidge, since the main premise itself remains still quite good and fun. I just could never really get involved with its story or its characters, which was a real shame, since this seemed to be what the movie was really pushing for. It wanted you to really love all of its characters and made some of them as goofy as possible. But really the only character that truly works out and becomes a greatly fun and memorable one is the Val Kilmer character. But this in itself is still enough to make the movie a real fun and entertaining one to watch! It makes it once more obvious what a waste it is that Val Kilmer never really broke through as a comedy actor and didn't do more movies like this during his career. Most people now days only known and recognize him for his serious movie roles. In this movie he looked almost as outrageous as he does now days and that is saying a lot! Val Kilmer his look has changed very drastically over the last couple of years and with change I mean his pretty extreme sudden weight gain, while he was once a true Hollywood heartthrob. The sort of 'childish' '80's teenage comedy approach is what makes the movie actually charming and in a way also irresistible to watch. It provides the movie with plenty of crazy situations, as well as some serious teenage issues, that still appeal and apply to teenagers this present day. This is also really what makes these genre movies from the '80's such timeless ones and are also really the reason why some of them are still being so popular to watch now days. I would exactly classify this movie as one of the classics- or best examples for its genre but it's definitely worth giving a go. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    In the late 60's-early 70's I was a math and physics geek dreaming and working at getting a scholarship to Caltech, the real university fictionalized in the film. The Vietnam War and a draft lottery number of 5 intervened so I wound up joining the Navy and actually working on WMDs as I hunted the Great Steel Whales. I must have seen this film 50 times over the years and it's always funny and fresh each time. Contrary to the opinions of many, The plot IS based on the true story of a Caltech grad student who invented the X-ray laser for eye surgery; only to have Edward Teller of the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Weapons Labs try to turn it into a space-based particle beam weapon for Reagan's Star Wars project. Many of the incidents depicted are taken directly from the hijinks Caltech students engage in during the annual Ditch Day celebrations. I won't rehash the plot since so many have already done so on these pages. Suffice to say that a great, funny, literate script, journeyman direction by Martha Coolidge and believable performances by Jarret, Kilmer, Atherton, Meyrink, et all put this film a cut above virtually all the other 80's school and nerd comedies. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was due to the somewhat cheesy special effects of the B1-B bomber used in the weapon's test. Ironically enough, I lived in Pasadena in the late 90's/early 00's and drove past Caltech every day on my way home from work. There I would periodically see busloads of Chinese tourists from the People's Republic taking each other's pictures in front of the Caltech administration building. I always wondered how many of THEM had seen this film and if seeing it would have changed their enthusiasm for the place.

    Today I was rumaging threw my movie collection and came across Real Genius and thought it would be the next perfect movie to review. Real genius is a saterical comedy staring Val Kilmer.Another movie I cought on HBO one Saturday morning that quickly became one of my favorites.Real Genius is about a 16 year old kid named Mitch (Gabe Jarret) which the only other movie I saw him in was Apollo 13. Mitch gets accepted to one of the best colleges in the country and is recruited to create a super lazer with the help of his dorm roommate one of the top brains and all around goofballs Chris (Val Kilmer) though they have no idea what it will be used for.While this is going on Mitch sees a man who's been living in their closet named Lazlo (Jonathan Gries who also played Napoleon Dynamites meat throwing uncle) Lazlo tells them that they might have just made a lazer that could be used for the military and they set up a plan to stop it.Does their plan work? you'll just have to see the movie to find out With a great cast and great 80's music from the likes of Tears for Fears,Bryan Adams and Don Henley this is definitely a movie to check out at least once although you wont wanna see it just once but I may just be saying that since I consider this my favorite movie. Since I really see nothing wrong with this movie i'll rate it five lazer beams out of five

    I remember seeing this movie many years ago and really enjoying it. So this year I watched it again and may I say, "Wow!". It was just as good as the first time I saw it many years ago. It was truly a huge blast of nostalgia. I truly did enjoy this movie, it's a reminder of how comedy should be these days. Also, Val Kilmer does a great job in this movie as " Chris Knight", definitely one of his best roles next to Iceman in "Top Gun". All in all, this is a great classic but, sadly forgotten 80s film, it's probably my favorite film of the 80s and definitely ranks in my Top 5 Favorite Films of All Time. Real Genius: 10/10

    There really is a difference between smart people and nerds. You can be smart and fun at the same time. You can be witty and someone socially desirable all at once. Getting good grades and doesn't necessarily sentence you to a life as a social pariah. Most of the characters we meet in Real Genius are not actually nerds. The Kent character would be an exception. But Real Genius is a fun and reasonably intelligent comedy with exceptionally smart people as its heroes. And unlike the protagonists in Revenge of the Nerds, they aren't people you'd necessarily make fun of. But you can certainly laugh at them. Real Genius is the story of a handful of whiz kids at mythical Pacific Tech University who are unwittingly being used to develop a deadly weapon for the CIA. It turns out their smarmy professor (William Atherton) is using a government grant to refurbish his home while his students relentlessly spend all of their waking moments in a lab developing a laser beam which can eradicate a human target from space. Gabe Jarret is a 15 yr old new to the team who finds himself roomed with Val Kilmer; a genius who has long ago decided not to take school so seriously. Jarret only wants to work on the laser and live up to the expectations of his parents and the faculty. Kilmer wants to teach the kid how to have some fun. And all the while this dangerous weapon is being created in their lab. Finally, after several plot complications, the weapon is complete. But it takes a former whiz kid living in the steam tunnels beneath the dorm to point out that this laser can really only have one use. Feeling betrayed, the students gang up on their professor and use his weapon to teach him a lesson. Real Genius is not a particularly plausible film in terms of its plot, but it succeeds at its most basic goal. In other words, its funny. Kilmer has never been better, spouting smug one-liners that would make Chevy Chase or Bill Murray smile. Atherton always got to play the creep back in the 1980s, and as usual he does it quite well. Gabe Jarret never did much else, but he's as good as he needs to be as the new "stud" who can hardly believe he's doing what he's doing at age 15. The film has dated fairly well. It has a good soundtrack, good special f/x for the laser, and good cast with several memorable performances. There are some unnecessary elements, such as the mixer with student beauticians, and perhaps Jarret's relationship with the hyper girl down the hall was tacked on. But overall its still a winner after so many years. Worth a rental if you don't own it already. 8 of 10 stars. The Hound

    We know how funny actor Val Kilmer could be after his debut performance in the comedy spoof "Top Secret", and the filmmakers here took that chance by giving the fresh faced actor one of central roles where he would truly make light work of his flamboyantly off-the-wall character. It's Kilmer's show and boy does he take control! Working off a bright and snappy script, Kilmer is let loose and brings much needed zip and a real quirkiness to his magnificently inspired performance. With "Real Genius" it was one of those films that passed me by, but when I noticed it I was expecting your basic ho-hum teen comedy, but while it might have the token characters and usual situations it actually had a fresh and clever spin to it all. Sure the chaotic and scatty slapstick/screwball humour might not always come off, but it never outstays its welcome by getting on with things as it was constantly thinking on its feet. When its spot on (either with it radical dialogues or visual gags --- as there's plenty of the latter), it's quite good.

Jon Gries is enjoyably dry and then you get the lovely ladies Patti D'Arbanville and Deborah Foreman in minor, but potent parts.

Mitch gets accepted to one of the best colleges in the country and is recruited to create a super lazer with the help of his dorm roommate one of the top brains and all around goofballs Chris (Val Kilmer) though they have no idea what it will be used for.While this is going on Mitch sees a man who's been living in their closet named Lazlo (Jonathan Gries who also played Napoleon Dynamites meat throwing uncle) Lazlo tells them that they might have just made a lazer that could be used for the military and they set up a plan to stop it.Does their plan work? you'll just have to see the movie to find out With a great cast and great 80's music from the likes of Tears for Fears,Bryan Adams and Don Henley this is definitely a movie to check out at least once although you wont wanna see it just once but I may just be saying that since I consider this my favorite movie. Since I really see nothing wrong with this movie i'll rate it five lazer beams out of five

    I remember seeing this movie many years ago and really enjoying it. So this year I watched it again and may I say, "Wow!". It was just as good as the first time I saw it many years ago. It was truly a huge blast of nostalgia. I truly did enjoy this movie, it's a reminder of how comedy should be these days. Also, Val Kilmer does a great job in this movie as " Chris Knight", definitely one of his best roles next to Iceman in "Top Gun". All in all, this is a great classic but, sadly forgotten 80s film, it's probably my favorite film of the 80s and definitely ranks in my Top 5 Favorite Films of All Time. Real Genius: 10/10

    There really is a difference between smart people and nerds. You can be smart and fun at the same time. You can be witty and someone socially desirable all at once. Getting good grades and doesn't necessarily sentence you to a life as a social pariah. Most of the characters we meet in Real Genius are not actually nerds. The Kent character would be an exception. But Real Genius is a fun and reasonably intelligent comedy with exceptionally smart people as its heroes. And unlike the protagonists in Revenge of the Nerds, they aren't people you'd necessarily make fun of. But you can certainly laugh at them. Real Genius is the story of a handful of whiz kids at mythical Pacific Tech University who are unwittingly being used to develop a deadly weapon for the CIA. It turns out their smarmy professor (William Atherton) is using a government grant to refurbish his home while his students relentlessly spend all of their waking moments in a lab developing a laser beam which can eradicate a human target from space. Gabe Jarret is a 15 yr old new to the team who finds himself roomed with Val Kilmer; a genius who has long ago decided not to take school so seriously. Jarret only wants to work on the laser and live up to the expectations of his parents and the faculty. Kilmer wants to teach the kid how to have some fun. And all the while this dangerous weapon is being created in their lab. Finally, after several plot complications, the weapon is complete. But it takes a former whiz kid living in the steam tunnels beneath the dorm to point out that this laser can really only have one use. Feeling betrayed, the students gang up on their professor and use his weapon to teach him a lesson. Real Genius is not a particularly plausible film in terms of its plot, but it succeeds at its most basic goal. In other words, its funny. Kilmer has never been better, spouting smug one-liners that would make Chevy Chase or Bill Murray smile. Atherton always got to play the creep back in the 1980s, and as usual he does it quite well. Gabe Jarret never did much else, but he's as good as he needs to be as the new "stud" who can hardly believe he's doing what he's doing at age 15. The film has dated fairly well. It has a good soundtrack, good special f/x for the laser, and good cast with several memorable performances. There are some unnecessary elements, such as the mixer with student beauticians, and perhaps Jarret's relationship with the hyper girl down the hall was tacked on. But overall its still a winner after so many years. Worth a rental if you don't own it already. 8 of 10 stars. The Hound

    We know how funny actor Val Kilmer could be after his debut performance in the comedy spoof "Top Secret", and the filmmakers here took that chance by giving the fresh faced actor one of central roles where he would truly make light work of his flamboyantly off-the-wall character. It's Kilmer's show and boy does he take control! Working off a bright and snappy script, Kilmer is let loose and brings much needed zip and a real quirkiness to his magnificently inspired performance. With "Real Genius" it was one of those films that passed me by, but when I noticed it I was expecting your basic ho-hum teen comedy, but while it might have the token characters and usual situations it actually had a fresh and clever spin to it all. Sure the chaotic and scatty slapstick/screwball humour might not always come off, but it never outstays its welcome by getting on with things as it was constantly thinking on its feet. When its spot on (either with it radical dialogues or visual gags --- as there's plenty of the latter), it's quite good. It even has a message to boot; no matter how hard you work, there's always time to take a break and enjoy life's many experiences or maybe be careful if you're super smart as the military might just abuse that gift. Yes, the plot follows that of Mitch Taylor a 15 year old whiz kid that joins a school of fellow scientific prodigies. There he meets Chris Knight, who likes to have a good time than be caught studying. However unknowingly to them their professor is exploiting them in an attempt to create a laser weapon for the military. A technically slick presentation by director Martha Coolidge who showers the air with punchy 80s tunes and gets a bunch of capable performances from the cast. William Atherton is picture-perfect as the smug professor and Gabriel Jarret brings the right quality to his na&iuml;ve character Mitch. Michelle Meyrink is adorably sweet as one of the students; Robert Prescott is good fun as a suck-up nerdy student and look out for Yuji Okumoto (who I'll always remember for his part in "Better off Dead") as one of the whizzes. Jon Gries is enjoyably dry and then you get the lovely ladies Patti D'Arbanville and Deborah Foreman in minor, but potent parts.

    This movie was terrible! Normally I love 80s movies, especially wacky, zany, or unique ones such as Better Off Dead, One Crazy Summer, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Real Genius falls into this wacky and zany category, but also falls into the obnoxious and not funny category. In this movie, a 15 year old genius boy with idiot parents gets into college at his young age, decides he can't take living there, decides he can take it after all, then it turns out he was involved in the creation of some super laser that can blast through anything. The plot was stupid and the jokes were all crude and not even funny. The movie was overall weird and had no charm. The genius kid also falls in love with a freak girl who never sleeps. This movie was lame and had crappy music and I regret ever watching it. Do yourself a favor and pick a different 80s comedy such as the ones I mentioned earlier.

    Written brilliantly by Neal Isra,Pat Proft & Peter Torokvei & Superbly Directed by Martha Coolidge comes a Cult Classic in true means, it's 'Real Genius'. A Mind-blowing Entertainer that has everything! 'Real Genius' is a story about 2-Geniuses mainly, who can create anything with their sharp-brains. Throwing a Beach Party in a auditorium complete with a lagoon and bikini-clad beauties. Or turn a dorm into am Ice-Skating rick, dismantle a nerd's car and reassemble it in his room... you ask anything, and these Geniuses have it. 'Real Genius' has a good-twist, with a secret weapon being invented... but more than that it's a full-on entertainer. A must see film! Acting wise, Val Kilmer is outstanding as a genius head. The Now Veteran-Actor is in terrific form. Gabriel Jarret is lovable as Mitch. It's sad to know that this talented actor didn't make many movies. Michelle Meyrink is excellent. So is Jon Gries as Lazlo. Robert Prescott does a oh-so-nerd act well. William Atherton is fine as the bad-guy. Watch this cult classic now...

    This movie brings back a lot of memories and it's one of Val Kilmer's most entertaining comedies. This movie belongs on the shelf beside the greatest classics: Back to the Future, The Goonies, Wargames, Weird Science, etc ... I'm not going to recap the movie or give my interpretation on the movie. Everything is relative. I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and I'm going to watch it right now (I'm 28 btw). Check it out. Val Kilmer does an amazing job in this movie. He's such a confident and amusing actor. If you're a fan of Val Kilmer as I am then you're going to enjoy this movie. I agree with the last comment made on this movie. I could watch this movie every day. Enjoy!

    While there were a lot of popular teen comedies from the 80's only a few really standout in retrospect, this film along with most of John Hughes work is amongst them. The story follows teenage prodigy Mitch who is recruited by the fictitious Pacific Tech University so that he might join other top young scientific minds bent on developing a powerful laser ostensibly to advance science but in reality to provide the military with a weapon for their arsenal. Mitch is played by Gabriel Jarret who is adequate in the role, while the supporting cast includes William Atherton (Die Hard, Ghostbusters) as the professor in charge and Michele Meyrink playing the hyperactive Jordan who becomes Mitch's love interest, Meyrink is very effective in her role but didn't have much of a career subsequently. The big star of the film though is Val Kilmer who plays Chris Knight who mentors the uptight Mitch both academically and socially. The films director is Martha Coolidge who seems to have had less success than her talent might have justified. The film offers an interesting portrayal of college campus life in the 1980's (at least) which seems for the most part far more accurate than other depictions. The film also covers the fairly common 1980's theme of a government conspiracy. In closing the film features a great choice of closing title music, at least for the 1980's with "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears.

    It has often been said that once you love "Weird Science" you'll also like "Real Genius". And while I guess this is true, I really wouldn't place both movies into the same category an onto the same level. This is really a movie in the vain of other great, classic goofball '80's comedies, focusing on young students. Looking back at it, this really was the golden age for comedies and the lovers of the genre and time period will surely be able to appreciate this movie. And I can certainly appreciate this movie as well, for what it is. That doesn't mean that I can simply ignore all of its flaws and weaknesses as well though. The movie is fun but that is about all that the movie is. One of the things that I thought the movie was really lacking in was its story. And I'm not just talking about its main premise but more so about all of its developments, the way things progress and the characters. I guess part of this can also be blamed on the directing by Martha Coolidge, since the main premise itself remains still quite good and fun. I just could never really get involved with its story or its characters, which was a real shame, since this seemed to be what the movie was really pushing for. It wanted you to really love all of its characters and made some of them as goofy as possible. But really the only character that truly works out and becomes a greatly fun and memorable one is the Val Kilmer character. But this in itself is still enough to make the movie a real fun and entertaining one to watch! It makes it once more obvious what a waste it is that Val Kilmer never really broke through as a comedy actor and didn't do more movies like this during his career. Most people now days only known and recognize him for his serious movie roles. In this movie he looked almost as outrageous as he does now days and that is saying a lot! Val Kilmer his look has changed very drastically over the last couple of years and with change I mean his pretty extreme sudden weight gain, while he was once a true Hollywood heartthrob. The sort of 'childish' '80's teenage comedy approach is what makes the movie actually charming and in a way also irresistible to watch. It provides the movie with plenty of crazy situations, as well as some serious teenage issues, that still appeal and apply to teenagers this present day. This is also really what makes these genre movies from the '80's such timeless ones and are also really the reason why some of them are still being so popular to watch now days. I would exactly classify this movie as one of the classics- or best examples for its genre but it's definitely worth giving a go. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    In the late 60's-early 70's I was a math and physics geek dreaming and working at getting a scholarship to Caltech, the real university fictionalized in the film. The Vietnam War and a draft lottery number of 5 intervened so I wound up joining the Navy and actually working on WMDs as I hunted the Great Steel Whales. I must have seen this film 50 times over the years and it's always funny and fresh each time. Contrary to the opinions of many, The plot IS based on the true story of a Caltech grad student who invented the X-ray laser for eye surgery; only to have Edward Teller of the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Weapons Labs try to turn it into a space-based particle beam weapon for Reagan's Star Wars project. Many of the incidents depicted are taken directly from the hijinks Caltech students engage in during the annual Ditch Day celebrations. I won't rehash the plot since so many have already done so on these pages. Suffice to say that a great, funny, literate script, journeyman direction by Martha Coolidge and believable performances by Jarret, Kilmer, Atherton, Meyrink, et all put this film a cut above virtually all the other 80's school and nerd comedies. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was due to the somewhat cheesy special effects of the B1-B bomber used in the weapon's test. Ironically enough, I lived in Pasadena in the late 90's/early 00's and drove past Caltech every day on my way home from work. There I would periodically see busloads of Chinese tourists from the People's Republic taking each other's pictures in front of the Caltech administration building. I always wondered how many of THEM had seen this film and if seeing it would have changed their enthusiasm for the place.

And while I guess this is true, I really wouldn't place both movies into the same category an onto the same level. This is really a movie in the vain of other great, classic goofball '80's comedies, focusing on young students. Looking back at it, this really was the golden age for comedies and the lovers of the genre and time period will surely be able to appreciate this movie. And I can certainly appreciate this movie as well, for what it is. That doesn't mean that I can simply ignore all of its flaws and weaknesses as well though. The movie is fun but that is about all that the movie is. One of the things that I thought the movie was really lacking in was its story. And I'm not just talking about its main premise but more so about all of its developments, the way things progress and the characters. I guess part of this can also be blamed on the directing by Martha Coolidge, since the main premise itself remains still quite good and fun. I just could never really get involved with its story or its characters, which was a real shame, since this seemed to be what the movie was really pushing for. It wanted you to really love all of its characters and made some of them as goofy as possible. But really the only character that truly works out and becomes a greatly fun and memorable one is the Val Kilmer character. But this in itself is still enough to make the movie a real fun and entertaining one to watch! It makes it once more obvious what a waste it is that Val Kilmer never really broke through as a comedy actor and didn't do more movies like this during his career. Most people now days only known and recognize him for his serious movie roles. In this movie he looked almost as outrageous as he does now days and that is saying a lot! Val Kilmer his look has changed very drastically over the last couple of years and with change I mean his pretty extreme sudden weight gain, while he was once a true Hollywood heartthrob. The sort of 'childish' '80's teenage comedy approach is what makes the movie actually charming and in a way also irresistible to watch. It provides the movie with plenty of crazy situations, as well as some serious teenage issues, that still appeal and apply to teenagers this present day. This is also really what makes these genre movies from the '80's such timeless ones and are also really the reason why some of them are still being so popular to watch now days. I would exactly classify this movie as one of the classics- or best examples for its genre but it's definitely worth giving a go. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    In the late 60's-early 70's I was a math and physics geek dreaming and working at getting a scholarship to Caltech, the real university fictionalized in the film. The Vietnam War and a draft lottery number of 5 intervened so I wound up joining the Navy and actually working on WMDs as I hunted the Great Steel Whales. I must have seen this film 50 times over the years and it's always funny and fresh each time. Contrary to the opinions of many, The plot IS based on the true story of a Caltech grad student who invented the X-ray laser for eye surgery; only to have Edward Teller of the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Weapons Labs try to turn it into a space-based particle beam weapon for Reagan's Star Wars project. Many of the incidents depicted are taken directly from the hijinks Caltech students engage in during the annual Ditch Day celebrations. I won't rehash the plot since so many have already done so on these pages. Suffice to say that a great, funny, literate script, journeyman direction by Martha Coolidge and believable performances by Jarret, Kilmer, Atherton, Meyrink, et all put this film a cut above virtually all the other 80's school and nerd comedies. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was due to the somewhat cheesy special effects of the B1-B bomber used in the weapon's test. Ironically enough, I lived in Pasadena in the late 90's/early 00's and drove past Caltech every day on my way home from work. There I would periodically see busloads of Chinese tourists from the People's Republic taking each other's pictures in front of the Caltech administration building. I always wondered how many of THEM had seen this film and if seeing it would have changed their enthusiasm for the place.

    Today I was rumaging threw my movie collection and came across Real Genius and thought it would be the next perfect movie to review. Real genius is a saterical comedy staring Val Kilmer.Another movie I cought on HBO one Saturday morning that quickly became one of my favorites.Real Genius is about a 16 year old kid named Mitch (Gabe Jarret) which the only other movie I saw him in was Apollo 13. Mitch gets accepted to one of the best colleges in the country and is recruited to create a super lazer with the help of his dorm roommate one of the top brains and all around goofballs Chris (Val Kilmer) though they have no idea what it will be used for.While this is going on Mitch sees a man who's been living in their closet named Lazlo (Jonathan Gries who also played Napoleon Dynamites meat throwing uncle) Lazlo tells them that they might have just made a lazer that could be used for the military and they set up a plan to stop it.Does their plan work? you'll just have to see the movie to find out With a great cast and great 80's music from the likes of Tears for Fears,Bryan Adams and Don Henley this is definitely a movie to check out at least once although you wont wanna see it just once but I may just be saying that since I consider this my favorite movie. Since I really see nothing wrong with this movie i'll rate it five lazer beams out of five

    I remember seeing this movie many years ago and really enjoying it. So this year I watched it again and may I say, "Wow!". It was just as good as the first time I saw it many years ago. It was truly a huge blast of nostalgia. I truly did enjoy this movie, it's a reminder of how comedy should be these days. Also, Val Kilmer does a great job in this movie as " Chris Knight", definitely one of his best roles next to Iceman in "Top Gun". All in all, this is a great classic but, sadly forgotten 80s film, it's probably my favorite film of the 80s and definitely ranks in my Top 5 Favorite Films of All Time. Real Genius: 10/10

    There really is a difference between smart people and nerds. You can be smart and fun at the same time. You can be witty and someone socially desirable all at once. Getting good grades and doesn't necessarily sentence you to a life as a social pariah. Most of the characters we meet in Real Genius are not actually nerds. The Kent character would be an exception. But Real Genius is a fun and reasonably intelligent comedy with exceptionally smart people as its heroes. And unlike the protagonists in Revenge of the Nerds, they aren't people you'd necessarily make fun of. But you can certainly laugh at them. Real Genius is the story of a handful of whiz kids at mythical Pacific Tech University who are unwittingly being used to develop a deadly weapon for the CIA. It turns out their smarmy professor (William Atherton) is using a government grant to refurbish his home while his students relentlessly spend all of their waking moments in a lab developing a laser beam which can eradicate a human target from space. Gabe Jarret is a 15 yr old new to the team who finds himself roomed with Val Kilmer; a genius who has long ago decided not to take school so seriously. Jarret only wants to work on the laser and live up to the expectations of his parents and the faculty. Kilmer wants to teach the kid how to have some fun. And all the while this dangerous weapon is being created in their lab. Finally, after several plot complications, the weapon is complete. But it takes a former whiz kid living in the steam tunnels beneath the dorm to point out that this laser can really only have one use. Feeling betrayed, the students gang up on their professor and use his weapon to teach him a lesson. Real Genius is not a particularly plausible film in terms of its plot, but it succeeds at its most basic goal. In other words, its funny. Kilmer has never been better, spouting smug one-liners that would make Chevy Chase or Bill Murray smile. Atherton always got to play the creep back in the 1980s, and as usual he does it quite well. Gabe Jarret never did much else, but he's as good as he needs to be as the new "stud" who can hardly believe he's doing what he's doing at age 15. The film has dated fairly well. It has a good soundtrack, good special f/x for the laser, and good cast with several memorable performances. There are some unnecessary elements, such as the mixer with student beauticians, and perhaps Jarret's relationship with the hyper girl down the hall was tacked on. But overall its still a winner after so many years. Worth a rental if you don't own it already. 8 of 10 stars. The Hound

    We know how funny actor Val Kilmer could be after his debut performance in the comedy spoof "Top Secret", and the filmmakers here took that chance by giving the fresh faced actor one of central roles where he would truly make light work of his flamboyantly off-the-wall character. It's Kilmer's show and boy does he take control! Working off a bright and snappy script, Kilmer is let loose and brings much needed zip and a real quirkiness to his magnificently inspired performance. With "Real Genius" it was one of those films that passed me by, but when I noticed it I was expecting your basic ho-hum teen comedy, but while it might have the token characters and usual situations it actually had a fresh and clever spin to it all. Sure the chaotic and scatty slapstick/screwball humour might not always come off, but it never outstays its welcome by getting on with things as it was constantly thinking on its feet. When its spot on (either with it radical dialogues or visual gags --- as there's plenty of the latter), it's quite good. It even has a message to boot; no matter how hard you work, there's always time to take a break and enjoy life's many experiences or maybe be careful if you're super smart as the military might just abuse that gift. Yes, the plot follows that of Mitch Taylor a 15 year old whiz kid that joins a school of fellow scientific prodigies. There he meets Chris Knight, who likes to have a good time than be caught studying. However unknowingly to them their professor is exploiting them in an attempt to create a laser weapon for the military. A technically slick presentation by director Martha Coolidge who showers the air with punchy 80s tunes and gets a bunch of capable performances from the cast. William Atherton is picture-perfect as the smug professor and Gabriel Jarret brings the right quality to his na&iuml;ve character Mitch. Michelle Meyrink is adorably sweet as one of the students; Robert Prescott is good fun as a suck-up nerdy student and look out for Yuji Okumoto (who I'll always remember for his part in "Better off Dead") as one of the whizzes. Jon Gries is enjoyably dry and then you get the lovely ladies Patti D'Arbanville and Deborah Foreman in minor, but potent parts.

    This movie was terrible! Normally I love 80s movies, especially wacky, zany, or unique ones such as Better Off Dead, One Crazy Summer, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Real Genius falls into this wacky and zany category, but also falls into the obnoxious and not funny category. In this movie, a 15 year old genius boy with idiot parents gets into college at his young age, decides he can't take living there, decides he can take it after all, then it turns out he was involved in the creation of some super laser that can blast through anything. The plot was stupid and the jokes were all crude and not even funny. The movie was overall weird and had no charm. The genius kid also falls in love with a freak girl who never sleeps. This movie was lame and had crappy music and I regret ever watching it. Do yourself a favor and pick a different 80s comedy such as the ones I mentioned earlier.

    Written brilliantly by Neal Isra,Pat Proft & Peter Torokvei & Superbly Directed by Martha Coolidge comes a Cult Classic in true means, it's 'Real Genius'. A Mind-blowing Entertainer that has everything! 'Real Genius' is a story about 2-Geniuses mainly, who can create anything with their sharp-brains. Throwing a Beach Party in a auditorium complete with a lagoon and bikini-clad beauties. Or turn a dorm into am Ice-Skating rick, dismantle a nerd's car and reassemble it in his room... you ask anything, and these Geniuses have it. 'Real Genius' has a good-twist, with a secret weapon being invented... but more than that it's a full-on entertainer. A must see film! Acting wise, Val Kilmer is outstanding as a genius head. The Now Veteran-Actor is in terrific form. Gabriel Jarret is lovable as Mitch. It's sad to know that this talented actor didn't make many movies. Michelle Meyrink is excellent. So is Jon Gries as Lazlo. Robert Prescott does a oh-so-nerd act well. William Atherton is fine as the bad-guy. Watch this cult classic now...

    This movie brings back a lot of memories and it's one of Val Kilmer's most entertaining comedies. This movie belongs on the shelf beside the greatest classics: Back to the Future, The Goonies, Wargames, Weird Science, etc ... I'm not going to recap the movie or give my interpretation on the movie. Everything is relative. I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and I'm going to watch it right now (I'm 28 btw). Check it out. Val Kilmer does an amazing job in this movie. He's such a confident and amusing actor. If you're a fan of Val Kilmer as I am then you're going to enjoy this movie. I agree with the last comment made on this movie. I could watch this movie every day. Enjoy!

    While there were a lot of popular teen comedies from the 80's only a few really standout in retrospect, this film along with most of John Hughes work is amongst them. The story follows teenage prodigy Mitch who is recruited by the fictitious Pacific Tech University so that he might join other top young scientific minds bent on developing a powerful laser ostensibly to advance science but in reality to provide the military with a weapon for their arsenal. Mitch is played by Gabriel Jarret who is adequate in the role, while the supporting cast includes William Atherton (Die Hard, Ghostbusters) as the professor in charge and Michele Meyrink playing the hyperactive Jordan who becomes Mitch's love interest, Meyrink is very effective in her role but didn't have much of a career subsequently. The big star of the film though is Val Kilmer who plays Chris Knight who mentors the uptight Mitch both academically and socially. The films director is Martha Coolidge who seems to have had less success than her talent might have justified. The film offers an interesting portrayal of college campus life in the 1980's (at least) which seems for the most part far more accurate than other depictions. The film also covers the fairly common 1980's theme of a government conspiracy. In closing the film features a great choice of closing title music, at least for the 1980's with "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears.

This movie was lame and had crappy music and I regret ever watching it. Do yourself a favor and pick a different 80s comedy such as the ones I mentioned earlier.

    Written brilliantly by Neal Isra,Pat Proft & Peter Torokvei & Superbly Directed by Martha Coolidge comes a Cult Classic in true means, it's 'Real Genius'. A Mind-blowing Entertainer that has everything! 'Real Genius' is a story about 2-Geniuses mainly, who can create anything with their sharp-brains. Throwing a Beach Party in a auditorium complete with a lagoon and bikini-clad beauties. Or turn a dorm into am Ice-Skating rick, dismantle a nerd's car and reassemble it in his room... you ask anything, and these Geniuses have it. 'Real Genius' has a good-twist, with a secret weapon being invented... but more than that it's a full-on entertainer. A must see film! Acting wise, Val Kilmer is outstanding as a genius head. The Now Veteran-Actor is in terrific form. Gabriel Jarret is lovable as Mitch. It's sad to know that this talented actor didn't make many movies. Michelle Meyrink is excellent. So is Jon Gries as Lazlo. Robert Prescott does a oh-so-nerd act well. William Atherton is fine as the bad-guy. Watch this cult classic now...

    This movie brings back a lot of memories and it's one of Val Kilmer's most entertaining comedies. This movie belongs on the shelf beside the greatest classics: Back to the Future, The Goonies, Wargames, Weird Science, etc ... I'm not going to recap the movie or give my interpretation on the movie. Everything is relative. I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and I'm going to watch it right now (I'm 28 btw). Check it out. Val Kilmer does an amazing job in this movie. He's such a confident and amusing actor. If you're a fan of Val Kilmer as I am then you're going to enjoy this movie. I agree with the last comment made on this movie. I could watch this movie every day. Enjoy!

    While there were a lot of popular teen comedies from the 80's only a few really standout in retrospect, this film along with most of John Hughes work is amongst them. The story follows teenage prodigy Mitch who is recruited by the fictitious Pacific Tech University so that he might join other top young scientific minds bent on developing a powerful laser ostensibly to advance science but in reality to provide the military with a weapon for their arsenal. Mitch is played by Gabriel Jarret who is adequate in the role, while the supporting cast includes William Atherton (Die Hard, Ghostbusters) as the professor in charge and Michele Meyrink playing the hyperactive Jordan who becomes Mitch's love interest, Meyrink is very effective in her role but didn't have much of a career subsequently. The big star of the film though is Val Kilmer who plays Chris Knight who mentors the uptight Mitch both academically and socially. The films director is Martha Coolidge who seems to have had less success than her talent might have justified. The film offers an interesting portrayal of college campus life in the 1980's (at least) which seems for the most part far more accurate than other depictions. The film also covers the fairly common 1980's theme of a government conspiracy. In closing the film features a great choice of closing title music, at least for the 1980's with "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears.

    It has often been said that once you love "Weird Science" you'll also like "Real Genius". And while I guess this is true, I really wouldn't place both movies into the same category an onto the same level. This is really a movie in the vain of other great, classic goofball '80's comedies, focusing on young students. Looking back at it, this really was the golden age for comedies and the lovers of the genre and time period will surely be able to appreciate this movie. And I can certainly appreciate this movie as well, for what it is. That doesn't mean that I can simply ignore all of its flaws and weaknesses as well though. The movie is fun but that is about all that the movie is. One of the things that I thought the movie was really lacking in was its story. And I'm not just talking about its main premise but more so about all of its developments, the way things progress and the characters. I guess part of this can also be blamed on the directing by Martha Coolidge, since the main premise itself remains still quite good and fun. I just could never really get involved with its story or its characters, which was a real shame, since this seemed to be what the movie was really pushing for. It wanted you to really love all of its characters and made some of them as goofy as possible. But really the only character that truly works out and becomes a greatly fun and memorable one is the Val Kilmer character. But this in itself is still enough to make the movie a real fun and entertaining one to watch! It makes it once more obvious what a waste it is that Val Kilmer never really broke through as a comedy actor and didn't do more movies like this during his career. Most people now days only known and recognize him for his serious movie roles. In this movie he looked almost as outrageous as he does now days and that is saying a lot! Val Kilmer his look has changed very drastically over the last couple of years and with change I mean his pretty extreme sudden weight gain, while he was once a true Hollywood heartthrob. The sort of 'childish' '80's teenage comedy approach is what makes the movie actually charming and in a way also irresistible to watch. It provides the movie with plenty of crazy situations, as well as some serious teenage issues, that still appeal and apply to teenagers this present day. This is also really what makes these genre movies from the '80's such timeless ones and are also really the reason why some of them are still being so popular to watch now days. I would exactly classify this movie as one of the classics- or best examples for its genre but it's definitely worth giving a go. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    In the late 60's-early 70's I was a math and physics geek dreaming and working at getting a scholarship to Caltech, the real university fictionalized in the film. The Vietnam War and a draft lottery number of 5 intervened so I wound up joining the Navy and actually working on WMDs as I hunted the Great Steel Whales. I must have seen this film 50 times over the years and it's always funny and fresh each time. Contrary to the opinions of many, The plot IS based on the true story of a Caltech grad student who invented the X-ray laser for eye surgery; only to have Edward Teller of the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Weapons Labs try to turn it into a space-based particle beam weapon for Reagan's Star Wars project. Many of the incidents depicted are taken directly from the hijinks Caltech students engage in during the annual Ditch Day celebrations. I won't rehash the plot since so many have already done so on these pages. Suffice to say that a great, funny, literate script, journeyman direction by Martha Coolidge and believable performances by Jarret, Kilmer, Atherton, Meyrink, et all put this film a cut above virtually all the other 80's school and nerd comedies. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was due to the somewhat cheesy special effects of the B1-B bomber used in the weapon's test. Ironically enough, I lived in Pasadena in the late 90's/early 00's and drove past Caltech every day on my way home from work. There I would periodically see busloads of Chinese tourists from the People's Republic taking each other's pictures in front of the Caltech administration building. I always wondered how many of THEM had seen this film and if seeing it would have changed their enthusiasm for the place.

    Today I was rumaging threw my movie collection and came across Real Genius and thought it would be the next perfect movie to review. Real genius is a saterical comedy staring Val Kilmer.Another movie I cought on HBO one Saturday morning that quickly became one of my favorites.Real Genius is about a 16 year old kid named Mitch (Gabe Jarret) which the only other movie I saw him in was Apollo 13. Mitch gets accepted to one of the best colleges in the country and is recruited to create a super lazer with the help of his dorm roommate one of the top brains and all around goofballs Chris (Val Kilmer) though they have no idea what it will be used for.While this is going on Mitch sees a man who's been living in their closet named Lazlo (Jonathan Gries who also played Napoleon Dynamites meat throwing uncle) Lazlo tells them that they might have just made a lazer that could be used for the military and they set up a plan to stop it.Does their plan work? you'll just have to see the movie to find out With a great cast and great 80's music from the likes of Tears for Fears,Bryan Adams and Don Henley this is definitely a movie to check out at least once although you wont wanna see it just once but I may just be saying that since I consider this my favorite movie. Since I really see nothing wrong with this movie i'll rate it five lazer beams out of five

    I remember seeing this movie many years ago and really enjoying it. So this year I watched it again and may I say, "Wow!". It was just as good as the first time I saw it many years ago. It was truly a huge blast of nostalgia. I truly did enjoy this movie, it's a reminder of how comedy should be these days. Also, Val Kilmer does a great job in this movie as " Chris Knight", definitely one of his best roles next to Iceman in "Top Gun". All in all, this is a great classic but, sadly forgotten 80s film, it's probably my favorite film of the 80s and definitely ranks in my Top 5 Favorite Films of All Time. Real Genius: 10/10

    There really is a difference between smart people and nerds. You can be smart and fun at the same time. You can be witty and someone socially desirable all at once. Getting good grades and doesn't necessarily sentence you to a life as a social pariah. Most of the characters we meet in Real Genius are not actually nerds. The Kent character would be an exception. But Real Genius is a fun and reasonably intelligent comedy with exceptionally smart people as its heroes. And unlike the protagonists in Revenge of the Nerds, they aren't people you'd necessarily make fun of. But you can certainly laugh at them. Real Genius is the story of a handful of whiz kids at mythical Pacific Tech University who are unwittingly being used to develop a deadly weapon for the CIA. It turns out their smarmy professor (William Atherton) is using a government grant to refurbish his home while his students relentlessly spend all of their waking moments in a lab developing a laser beam which can eradicate a human target from space. Gabe Jarret is a 15 yr old new to the team who finds himself roomed with Val Kilmer; a genius who has long ago decided not to take school so seriously. Jarret only wants to work on the laser and live up to the expectations of his parents and the faculty. Kilmer wants to teach the kid how to have some fun. And all the while this dangerous weapon is being created in their lab. Finally, after several plot complications, the weapon is complete. But it takes a former whiz kid living in the steam tunnels beneath the dorm to point out that this laser can really only have one use. Feeling betrayed, the students gang up on their professor and use his weapon to teach him a lesson. Real Genius is not a particularly plausible film in terms of its plot, but it succeeds at its most basic goal. In other words, its funny. Kilmer has never been better, spouting smug one-liners that would make Chevy Chase or Bill Murray smile. Atherton always got to play the creep back in the 1980s, and as usual he does it quite well. Gabe Jarret never did much else, but he's as good as he needs to be as the new "stud" who can hardly believe he's doing what he's doing at age 15. The film has dated fairly well. It has a good soundtrack, good special f/x for the laser, and good cast with several memorable performances. There are some unnecessary elements, such as the mixer with student beauticians, and perhaps Jarret's relationship with the hyper girl down the hall was tacked on. But overall its still a winner after so many years. Worth a rental if you don't own it already. 8 of 10 stars. The Hound

    We know how funny actor Val Kilmer could be after his debut performance in the comedy spoof "Top Secret", and the filmmakers here took that chance by giving the fresh faced actor one of central roles where he would truly make light work of his flamboyantly off-the-wall character. It's Kilmer's show and boy does he take control! Working off a bright and snappy script, Kilmer is let loose and brings much needed zip and a real quirkiness to his magnificently inspired performance. With "Real Genius" it was one of those films that passed me by, but when I noticed it I was expecting your basic ho-hum teen comedy, but while it might have the token characters and usual situations it actually had a fresh and clever spin to it all. Sure the chaotic and scatty slapstick/screwball humour might not always come off, but it never outstays its welcome by getting on with things as it was constantly thinking on its feet. When its spot on (either with it radical dialogues or visual gags --- as there's plenty of the latter), it's quite good. It even has a message to boot; no matter how hard you work, there's always time to take a break and enjoy life's many experiences or maybe be careful if you're super smart as the military might just abuse that gift. Yes, the plot follows that of Mitch Taylor a 15 year old whiz kid that joins a school of fellow scientific prodigies. There he meets Chris Knight, who likes to have a good time than be caught studying. However unknowingly to them their professor is exploiting them in an attempt to create a laser weapon for the military. A technically slick presentation by director Martha Coolidge who showers the air with punchy 80s tunes and gets a bunch of capable performances from the cast. William Atherton is picture-perfect as the smug professor and Gabriel Jarret brings the right quality to his na&iuml;ve character Mitch. Michelle Meyrink is adorably sweet as one of the students; Robert Prescott is good fun as a suck-up nerdy student and look out for Yuji Okumoto (who I'll always remember for his part in "Better off Dead") as one of the whizzes. Jon Gries is enjoyably dry and then you get the lovely ladies Patti D'Arbanville and Deborah Foreman in minor, but potent parts.

    This movie was terrible! Normally I love 80s movies, especially wacky, zany, or unique ones such as Better Off Dead, One Crazy Summer, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Real Genius falls into this wacky and zany category, but also falls into the obnoxious and not funny category. In this movie, a 15 year old genius boy with idiot parents gets into college at his young age, decides he can't take living there, decides he can take it after all, then it turns out he was involved in the creation of some super laser that can blast through anything. The plot was stupid and the jokes were all crude and not even funny. The movie was overall weird and had no charm. The genius kid also falls in love with a freak girl who never sleeps.

It turns out their smarmy professor (William Atherton) is using a government grant to refurbish his home while his students relentlessly spend all of their waking moments in a lab developing a laser beam which can eradicate a human target from space. Gabe Jarret is a 15 yr old new to the team who finds himself roomed with Val Kilmer; a genius who has long ago decided not to take school so seriously. Jarret only wants to work on the laser and live up to the expectations of his parents and the faculty. Kilmer wants to teach the kid how to have some fun. And all the while this dangerous weapon is being created in their lab. Finally, after several plot complications, the weapon is complete. But it takes a former whiz kid living in the steam tunnels beneath the dorm to point out that this laser can really only have one use. Feeling betrayed, the students gang up on their professor and use his weapon to teach him a lesson. Real Genius is not a particularly plausible film in terms of its plot, but it succeeds at its most basic goal. In other words, its funny. Kilmer has never been better, spouting smug one-liners that would make Chevy Chase or Bill Murray smile. Atherton always got to play the creep back in the 1980s, and as usual he does it quite well. Gabe Jarret never did much else, but he's as good as he needs to be as the new "stud" who can hardly believe he's doing what he's doing at age 15. The film has dated fairly well. It has a good soundtrack, good special f/x for the laser, and good cast with several memorable performances. There are some unnecessary elements, such as the mixer with student beauticians, and perhaps Jarret's relationship with the hyper girl down the hall was tacked on. But overall its still a winner after so many years. Worth a rental if you don't own it already. 8 of 10 stars. The Hound

    We know how funny actor Val Kilmer could be after his debut performance in the comedy spoof "Top Secret", and the filmmakers here took that chance by giving the fresh faced actor one of central roles where he would truly make light work of his flamboyantly off-the-wall character. It's Kilmer's show and boy does he take control! Working off a bright and snappy script, Kilmer is let loose and brings much needed zip and a real quirkiness to his magnificently inspired performance. With "Real Genius" it was one of those films that passed me by, but when I noticed it I was expecting your basic ho-hum teen comedy, but while it might have the token characters and usual situations it actually had a fresh and clever spin to it all. Sure the chaotic and scatty slapstick/screwball humour might not always come off, but it never outstays its welcome by getting on with things as it was constantly thinking on its feet. When its spot on (either with it radical dialogues or visual gags --- as there's plenty of the latter), it's quite good. It even has a message to boot; no matter how hard you work, there's always time to take a break and enjoy life's many experiences or maybe be careful if you're super smart as the military might just abuse that gift. Yes, the plot follows that of Mitch Taylor a 15 year old whiz kid that joins a school of fellow scientific prodigies. There he meets Chris Knight, who likes to have a good time than be caught studying. However unknowingly to them their professor is exploiting them in an attempt to create a laser weapon for the military. A technically slick presentation by director Martha Coolidge who showers the air with punchy 80s tunes and gets a bunch of capable performances from the cast. William Atherton is picture-perfect as the smug professor and Gabriel Jarret brings the right quality to his na&iuml;ve character Mitch. Michelle Meyrink is adorably sweet as one of the students; Robert Prescott is good fun as a suck-up nerdy student and look out for Yuji Okumoto (who I'll always remember for his part in "Better off Dead") as one of the whizzes. Jon Gries is enjoyably dry and then you get the lovely ladies Patti D'Arbanville and Deborah Foreman in minor, but potent parts.

    This movie was terrible! Normally I love 80s movies, especially wacky, zany, or unique ones such as Better Off Dead, One Crazy Summer, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Real Genius falls into this wacky and zany category, but also falls into the obnoxious and not funny category. In this movie, a 15 year old genius boy with idiot parents gets into college at his young age, decides he can't take living there, decides he can take it after all, then it turns out he was involved in the creation of some super laser that can blast through anything. The plot was stupid and the jokes were all crude and not even funny. The movie was overall weird and had no charm. The genius kid also falls in love with a freak girl who never sleeps. This movie was lame and had crappy music and I regret ever watching it. Do yourself a favor and pick a different 80s comedy such as the ones I mentioned earlier.

    Written brilliantly by Neal Isra,Pat Proft & Peter Torokvei & Superbly Directed by Martha Coolidge comes a Cult Classic in true means, it's 'Real Genius'. A Mind-blowing Entertainer that has everything! 'Real Genius' is a story about 2-Geniuses mainly, who can create anything with their sharp-brains. Throwing a Beach Party in a auditorium complete with a lagoon and bikini-clad beauties. Or turn a dorm into am Ice-Skating rick, dismantle a nerd's car and reassemble it in his room... you ask anything, and these Geniuses have it. 'Real Genius' has a good-twist, with a secret weapon being invented... but more than that it's a full-on entertainer. A must see film! Acting wise, Val Kilmer is outstanding as a genius head. The Now Veteran-Actor is in terrific form. Gabriel Jarret is lovable as Mitch. It's sad to know that this talented actor didn't make many movies. Michelle Meyrink is excellent. So is Jon Gries as Lazlo. Robert Prescott does a oh-so-nerd act well. William Atherton is fine as the bad-guy. Watch this cult classic now...

    This movie brings back a lot of memories and it's one of Val Kilmer's most entertaining comedies. This movie belongs on the shelf beside the greatest classics: Back to the Future, The Goonies, Wargames, Weird Science, etc ... I'm not going to recap the movie or give my interpretation on the movie. Everything is relative. I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and I'm going to watch it right now (I'm 28 btw). Check it out. Val Kilmer does an amazing job in this movie. He's such a confident and amusing actor. If you're a fan of Val Kilmer as I am then you're going to enjoy this movie. I agree with the last comment made on this movie. I could watch this movie every day. Enjoy!

    While there were a lot of popular teen comedies from the 80's only a few really standout in retrospect, this film along with most of John Hughes work is amongst them. The story follows teenage prodigy Mitch who is recruited by the fictitious Pacific Tech University so that he might join other top young scientific minds bent on developing a powerful laser ostensibly to advance science but in reality to provide the military with a weapon for their arsenal. Mitch is played by Gabriel Jarret who is adequate in the role, while the supporting cast includes William Atherton (Die Hard, Ghostbusters) as the professor in charge and Michele Meyrink playing the hyperactive Jordan who becomes Mitch's love interest, Meyrink is very effective in her role but didn't have much of a career subsequently. The big star of the film though is Val Kilmer who plays Chris Knight who mentors the uptight Mitch both academically and socially. The films director is Martha Coolidge who seems to have had less success than her talent might have justified. The film offers an interesting portrayal of college campus life in the 1980's (at least) which seems for the most part far more accurate than other depictions. The film also covers the fairly common 1980's theme of a government conspiracy. In closing the film features a great choice of closing title music, at least for the 1980's with "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears.

    It has often been said that once you love "Weird Science" you'll also like "Real Genius". And while I guess this is true, I really wouldn't place both movies into the same category an onto the same level. This is really a movie in the vain of other great, classic goofball '80's comedies, focusing on young students. Looking back at it, this really was the golden age for comedies and the lovers of the genre and time period will surely be able to appreciate this movie. And I can certainly appreciate this movie as well, for what it is. That doesn't mean that I can simply ignore all of its flaws and weaknesses as well though. The movie is fun but that is about all that the movie is. One of the things that I thought the movie was really lacking in was its story. And I'm not just talking about its main premise but more so about all of its developments, the way things progress and the characters. I guess part of this can also be blamed on the directing by Martha Coolidge, since the main premise itself remains still quite good and fun. I just could never really get involved with its story or its characters, which was a real shame, since this seemed to be what the movie was really pushing for. It wanted you to really love all of its characters and made some of them as goofy as possible. But really the only character that truly works out and becomes a greatly fun and memorable one is the Val Kilmer character. But this in itself is still enough to make the movie a real fun and entertaining one to watch! It makes it once more obvious what a waste it is that Val Kilmer never really broke through as a comedy actor and didn't do more movies like this during his career. Most people now days only known and recognize him for his serious movie roles. In this movie he looked almost as outrageous as he does now days and that is saying a lot! Val Kilmer his look has changed very drastically over the last couple of years and with change I mean his pretty extreme sudden weight gain, while he was once a true Hollywood heartthrob. The sort of 'childish' '80's teenage comedy approach is what makes the movie actually charming and in a way also irresistible to watch. It provides the movie with plenty of crazy situations, as well as some serious teenage issues, that still appeal and apply to teenagers this present day. This is also really what makes these genre movies from the '80's such timeless ones and are also really the reason why some of them are still being so popular to watch now days. I would exactly classify this movie as one of the classics- or best examples for its genre but it's definitely worth giving a go. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    In the late 60's-early 70's I was a math and physics geek dreaming and working at getting a scholarship to Caltech, the real university fictionalized in the film. The Vietnam War and a draft lottery number of 5 intervened so I wound up joining the Navy and actually working on WMDs as I hunted the Great Steel Whales. I must have seen this film 50 times over the years and it's always funny and fresh each time. Contrary to the opinions of many, The plot IS based on the true story of a Caltech grad student who invented the X-ray laser for eye surgery; only to have Edward Teller of the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Weapons Labs try to turn it into a space-based particle beam weapon for Reagan's Star Wars project. Many of the incidents depicted are taken directly from the hijinks Caltech students engage in during the annual Ditch Day celebrations. I won't rehash the plot since so many have already done so on these pages. Suffice to say that a great, funny, literate script, journeyman direction by Martha Coolidge and believable performances by Jarret, Kilmer, Atherton, Meyrink, et all put this film a cut above virtually all the other 80's school and nerd comedies. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was due to the somewhat cheesy special effects of the B1-B bomber used in the weapon's test. Ironically enough, I lived in Pasadena in the late 90's/early 00's and drove past Caltech every day on my way home from work. There I would periodically see busloads of Chinese tourists from the People's Republic taking each other's pictures in front of the Caltech administration building. I always wondered how many of THEM had seen this film and if seeing it would have changed their enthusiasm for the place.

    Today I was rumaging threw my movie collection and came across Real Genius and thought it would be the next perfect movie to review. Real genius is a saterical comedy staring Val Kilmer.Another movie I cought on HBO one Saturday morning that quickly became one of my favorites.Real Genius is about a 16 year old kid named Mitch (Gabe Jarret) which the only other movie I saw him in was Apollo 13. Mitch gets accepted to one of the best colleges in the country and is recruited to create a super lazer with the help of his dorm roommate one of the top brains and all around goofballs Chris (Val Kilmer) though they have no idea what it will be used for.While this is going on Mitch sees a man who's been living in their closet named Lazlo (Jonathan Gries who also played Napoleon Dynamites meat throwing uncle) Lazlo tells them that they might have just made a lazer that could be used for the military and they set up a plan to stop it.Does their plan work? you'll just have to see the movie to find out With a great cast and great 80's music from the likes of Tears for Fears,Bryan Adams and Don Henley this is definitely a movie to check out at least once although you wont wanna see it just once but I may just be saying that since I consider this my favorite movie. Since I really see nothing wrong with this movie i'll rate it five lazer beams out of five

    I remember seeing this movie many years ago and really enjoying it. So this year I watched it again and may I say, "Wow!". It was just as good as the first time I saw it many years ago. It was truly a huge blast of nostalgia. I truly did enjoy this movie, it's a reminder of how comedy should be these days. Also, Val Kilmer does a great job in this movie as " Chris Knight", definitely one of his best roles next to Iceman in "Top Gun". All in all, this is a great classic but, sadly forgotten 80s film, it's probably my favorite film of the 80s and definitely ranks in my Top 5 Favorite Films of All Time. Real Genius: 10/10

    There really is a difference between smart people and nerds. You can be smart and fun at the same time. You can be witty and someone socially desirable all at once. Getting good grades and doesn't necessarily sentence you to a life as a social pariah. Most of the characters we meet in Real Genius are not actually nerds. The Kent character would be an exception. But Real Genius is a fun and reasonably intelligent comedy with exceptionally smart people as its heroes. And unlike the protagonists in Revenge of the Nerds, they aren't people you'd necessarily make fun of. But you can certainly laugh at them. Real Genius is the story of a handful of whiz kids at mythical Pacific Tech University who are unwittingly being used to develop a deadly weapon for the CIA. It turns out their smarmy professor (William Atherton) is using a government grant to refurbish his home while his students relentlessly spend all of their waking moments in a lab developing a laser beam which can eradicate a human target from space. Gabe Jarret is a 15 yr old new to the team who finds himself roomed with Val Kilmer; a genius who has long ago decided not to take school so seriously. Jarret only wants to work on the laser and live up to the expectations of his parents and the faculty. Kilmer wants to teach the kid how to have some fun. And all the while this dangerous weapon is being created in their lab. Finally, after several plot complications, the weapon is complete.

There are some unnecessary elements, such as the mixer with student beauticians, and perhaps Jarret's relationship with the hyper girl down the hall was tacked on. But overall its still a winner after so many years. Worth a rental if you don't own it already. 8 of 10 stars. The Hound
