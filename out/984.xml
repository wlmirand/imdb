    ***SPOILERS*** The film "Shadow Conspirsey" comes across like a combination of "Three Days of the Condor" & "The Terminator" with this Arnold Schwarzenegger like hit man known as "the Agent", Stephen Lang, who despite unlike Arnold, in the aforementioned movie, being human seems to be indestructible as well as not answering to the both laws of nature or those of the, local as well as national, Justice Department! This mechanical like goon who never says a word throughout the entire movie goes around killing people at will with nobody able or willing to stop him. That's until he starts to tangle with the star of the show or film top presidential adviser Bobby Bishop, Charlie Sheen. What we find out almost as soon as the movie begins is that in the pay CIA contractor Prof.Yuri Pochenko, Theodore Bikel, uncovers a plot to knock off the President of the United States played by a very stiff looking Sam Waterman. It's President Sam who's about to cut off all military spending and used that money to improve the lives of the American people: Way to go Pres! It's then that "The Agent" is unpleased to put an end to Prof. Pochenko's group of dedicated and loyal Americans attempt to expose this group of men high up in the government and military by murdering them including Prof. Pochenko! That's before Prof.Pochenko let the cat out of the bag by getting in touch with Bobby Bishop about their evil plans that they have for the nation. Now a marked man and with Washington Herald top investigative reporter Amanda Givens played by Linda Hamilton, who also stared in the similar robot zombie assassin flick "The Termanator", joining him in exposing this shadow conspiracy Booby has no one to turn to. In that everyone he trusts even his mentor and good friend White House insider Jacob Conred, Donald Southerland, can very well be part of the conspiracy! It's the non stop action that saves the movie from putting you to sleep in that its plot is so full of holes and inconsistencies that it makes no sense at all. Bobby & Amanda eventually get to the bottom of what's happening after a number of unbelievable escapes that it takes the suspense out of the movie in knowing that whatever dangers they face, and it's a lot, they'll always literately come up, like in the exciting elevator scene, smelling like roses! ***SPOILERS*** The final scene when "The Agent" is about to ice the President and his entire cabinet, even those involved in the conspiracy to ice him, has to be seen to be believed. Using a remote controlled toy attack helicopter, much the attack hellfire drones now used in Afghanistan and Yemen, "The Agent" turns Washington D.C into a free fire zone! Eeven though in the end the good's guys lead by Bobby & Amanda save the day as well as the Presdent's life all they end up getting for their heroic efforts is some time off from their jobs to play a game of basketball!

    A lively little B-Movie political thriller that utilizes high-tech surveillance but is hampered by a low-budget. An energetic exercise with not much intrigue but a whole lot of gun-play. A psycho-killer and a band of conspirators, that are rarely really referenced or fleshed out, attempt to pull of a presidential assassination, so they turn D.C. into a mini war zone chasing one potential foe. The reason for this is not very clear and the convenient contrivances abound. But it all doesn't matter in this nifty looking movie that has a good deal of style and it is relentless in its montage of cat and mouse shenanigans. Never boring, and that makes up for its limitations and easy essaying.

    . . . . and, of course, you don't have to drive, you're with friends who have a sense of humor, and you all see nothing wrong with throwing crushed beer cans at the TV while you're all hooting and hollering at this really stupid movie. Just be prepared to watch the following, among just a few examples: Charlie, our hero, is fleeing down the fire escape from a murder scene in an apartment building, jumps into Linda's Jeep (or whatever) and they're speeding away. Suddenly, the assassin, who was several floors up in the building just a second ago, is now on the canvass top of the Jeep, stabbing through the top with a knife, and trying to murder Charlie for some reason. Meanwhile, Linda, who's driving, is careening down the Washington, D.C. street, swerving around heavy traffic. And nobody cares; nobody honks their horn, and the assassin doesn't seem to have a care in the world that he's on public display on the top of a Jeep careening down a major roadway in Washington, D.C. with a knife trying to murder Charlie. Within the White House, Donald Sotherland is told that Charlie is inside the building. Donald, in a strong and commanding voice,demands that they "Turn on the silent alarm!" So, they turn on the "silent alarm" and hundreds of little tiny red lights begin to flash in all the White House hallways, ceilings and walls in every room. Charlie sees the red, flashing lights and cries to Linda, "They've turned on the silent alarm!!!!" Kinda defeats the purpose of a silent alarm, don't ya think? Or, how about next when Charlie and Linda are being chased and shot at by all the security and plain clothes guys in the White House for some reason. They escape by entering the White House's sub-basement labyrinth of heating, air-conditioning and ventilation tunnels, with directional signs pointing out the turns back to the White House, or on to the Treasury Department, or on to The Executive Office Building. Well, Charlie and Linda finalize their escape by simply pushing open a grate and climbing out and onto a D.C. avenue. The message for everybody is that if you don't want to stand in line for a White House tour, just open any grate in the street and follow the directional signs to the White House (or, to the Treasury Building, if you're so inclined). Throughout the movie, Charlie and later Linda, are being chased and shot at in very public places. Yet the D.C. police, and the government, still think they're the bad guys. Get real. And finally, the assassin has been spending the entire movie creating some unknown but diabolical device for some reason. We finally discover he's gonna assassinate the president. How? The prez is to speak at a toy convention. The device is a remote-controlled toy helicopter, around 18-inches in length. It has two lethal machine guns that are killing just about everybody in the convention center but the prez. Though lethal, the powerful bullets have no kick-back at all, and the toy helicopter maintains its steady, deadly but inaccurate course. The day is saved when Charlie releases a net of toy red, white and blue balloons intended for the gala big finish, and the deadly helicopter crashes. There are some great actors in this flick. But I just have to wonder if they needed the money to pay off a bookie, or a boat payment, or the kids needed braces.

    This was the last film directed by George P. Cosmatos, a Greek born in Italy, who directed numerous Hollywood action movies and thrillers over the course of 24 years, including several with Greek settings. This one is set entirely in Washington, D.C., and it is a cracking conspiracy thriller about traitors inside the White House. The hero (who spends most of his time on the run from an assassin hired by the conspirators) is played by Charlie Sheen. Linda Hamilton plays a Washington political journalist with whom he is involved on and off, and they become co-fugitives. The dominant presence in this film, however, is that of Donald Sutherland, who acts circles round everyone else, as a security chief. Theodore Bikel has a bit part as a Russian scholar living in the USA who gets killed at the beginning of the story because he has discovered the traitors. Ben Gazzarra plays a character who stands around tables at the White House looking important and smug, but I did not understand until I looked at the credits on IMDb that he was meant to be the Vice President. The President is played by Sam Waterson, but he too is just a supporting character in the story. Gore Vidal has a fleeting bit part as a Congressman. The film contains an excess of action and not enough story. But it is very tense and 'thrilling' as a thriller should be, so it works within its genre. Charlie Sheen is very convincing as a young Special Assistant to the President who is constantly on the run because he has discovered the traitors who wish to assassinate the President. The assassin who keeps trying to kill him is played by Stephen Lang, who is absolutely terrifying, though why he wears a long white coat down to his ankles, thereby attracting a lot of attention to himself, is a mystery. (Aren't assassins supposed to be inconspicuous?) And how does he stow all of those guns under that flimsy coat? And how does he not get stopped by the police when he is shooting all those innocent bystanders in the streets like that? Oh, well, it's only a movie.

    This is one of those movies whose cast and trailer sound promising, only to drop the ball altogether when you watch it. It is no surprise it bombed miserably on the ticket booth. It was yet another conspiracy movie of they stream that peaked with Enemy of State in the mid-1990s. The Soviets and communists used to offer an easy, credible enemy to write a thriller movie about, so "average" plots could fit well on the screen. Without Soviets around, it became tricky to explore other enemies, and many movies were shot around that time with internal conspiracies within the US government. The cast is not bad at all, on the contrary, it is quite respectful. Photography is lackluster, though, and the characters are just not credible. The first 5 minutes are definitively the only salvageable part of the movie. As usual in this type of movie, the real intentions and objectives of characters are not clear from the beginning and there are some twists. Again, unfortunately those twists happen without any explanation or any crescendo that leads to them. It gives the viewer the impression that they needed to turn a "good guy" into a "bad guy" and just did it in a frustrating way. Were the cast not a A- cast as this is, it would have been a trash movie. The cast, indeed, did a good job on containing damage and ameliorating the failure this movie is.

    My Take: Routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. A rarely seen political thriller, which made a very poor box-office response, I managed to catch THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY on TV just now, and while I was glad that I satisfied my curiosity to see this rare film, I didn't exactly feel this film was all special. Considering the box-office response to it, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not all quite as bad as critics and the public reacted to it, but still ain't very good to begin with and everything, from script to direction, is pretty predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the presidential assistant who finds himself caught up with assassins and chases (a lot of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy which lurks amongst the White House staff. After a professor is murdered, Sheen aids the help of ex-flame reporter Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) to uncover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title. But this script, written by Adi Hasak & Ric Gibbs, are pedestrian as they come, not much differing from other White House conspiracy thrillers as in ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER AT 1600. Some considerable talents (Donald Sutherland, Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) try their best on a routine script, but rarely saves it from predictability of the script. Not to mention a ludicrous scene which involves a toy helicopter, which seems far too silly and out-of-place in this "serious" political thriller. THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its moments I'm sure, some of which are much to under-appreciated (director George Pan Cosmatos serves up some decent chase scenes), but none of which lifts this routine thriller of which there's not much payoff or surprises. Rating: ** out of 5.

    I would have liked to put 0.5 but unfortunately I can't. Who can write so bad scripts (I saw the movie five seconds and knew the "bad boy" would be Sutherland - needed to pay his taxes, when you see how good he was in Redford's movie, "Ordinary People" and others ! -). Though I don't like it, but I had no choice, I saw the movie in French, but I know that hearing the real voices of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton would have not change things, except maybe making it more pitiful. What makes me sick is that people earn their living making this bad stuff (I forgot to speak about Mr Waterson, far away from the Woody Allen's movies he once used to play in). We had another movie on another French channel : a silly James Bond with Brosnan (I am not talking about the real Bonds with Connery(please it's the end of holidays, wake up !).

    Now, this work doesn't reek, it's enjoyable, and energetic, in spite of its inability to be great. But it tries too hard to reach for that greatness, while still holding on to the life raft. Charlie Sheen never had it in him to be great. He was good, in many performances, in many different roles, but he is not capable of greatness on screen. The same can be said for Donald Sutherland. His son Keifer is far more talented, far more believable in roles as something great. Even when that something embodies a terrible darkness. This work, like its actors, tries to be great in its story, action, and political posturing, but like most who posture, it can lead nowhere, as posturing is not being, it's pretending to be. And that's all this movie could ever hope to achieve. The action is good, the story is good, the performances are good, and the characters are well written, but well written and good is all this has to give. It rates a 5.2/10 from... the Fiend :.

    This all looked quite promising. An up-and-coming Presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders, as he has been tipped off that a conspiracy is going on within the White House. It stars the excellent Donald Sutherland among several capable actors. Yet very few people have a good word to say about it. The whole thing really needed some depth. You can pick up the idea that the President is being too left-wing with his ideas, and some within the Government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out. Conrad appears to simply want the country to be Governed his way, rather than the way of the elected leader. However, the action scenes had a few logic holes - the sewers and elevators already mentioned, and the rather haphazard assassination method - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely uninspired. Her 'the President's my Father' 'diversion' was ludicrous - that would make the President about 10 when that happened. Worse still was her predictable final scene with Bishop. They could have made a challenging, inventive political thriller, but either bottled it or failed. They could've gone to town on special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They could have achieved so much more in general. This was barely worth the &pound;1 it cost me.

    This film starts with a pedestrian setup before blundering into the standard sort of suspense action where an office worker keeps beating up trained secret service men etc. I couldn't say the acting was bad - there were some good "surprised" faces by Hamilton and Sheen - but then I really wouldn't have to. Risible finale did at least give me a good laugh for my pains. Still, if my life was flashing before my eyes, I think I would fast forward this 90 minutes. I have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published. Yes, very resistant suit that sheen wears. I made a special promise to myself never to watch a film this bad again.

    My Take: Routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. A rarely seen political thriller, which made a very poor box-office response, I managed to catch THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY on TV just now, and while I was glad that I satisfied my curiosity to see this rare film, I didn't exactly feel this film was all special. Considering the box-office response to it, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not all quite as bad as critics and the public reacted to it, but still ain't very good to begin with and everything, from script to direction, is pretty predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the presidential assistant who finds himself caught up with assassins and chases (a lot of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy which lurks amongst the White House staff. After a professor is murdered, Sheen aids the help of ex-flame reporter Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) to uncover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title. But this script, written by Adi Hasak & Ric Gibbs, are pedestrian as they come, not much differing from other White House conspiracy thrillers as in ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER AT 1600. Some considerable talents (Donald Sutherland, Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) try their best on a routine script, but rarely saves it from predictability of the script. Not to mention a ludicrous scene which involves a toy helicopter, which seems far too silly and out-of-place in this "serious" political thriller. THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its moments I'm sure, some of which are much to under-appreciated (director George Pan Cosmatos serves up some decent chase scenes), but none of which lifts this routine thriller of which there's not much payoff or surprises. Rating: ** out of 5.

    I would have liked to put 0.5 but unfortunately I can't. Who can write so bad scripts (I saw the movie five seconds and knew the "bad boy" would be Sutherland - needed to pay his taxes, when you see how good he was in Redford's movie, "Ordinary People" and others ! -). Though I don't like it, but I had no choice, I saw the movie in French, but I know that hearing the real voices of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton would have not change things, except maybe making it more pitiful. What makes me sick is that people earn their living making this bad stuff (I forgot to speak about Mr Waterson, far away from the Woody Allen's movies he once used to play in). We had another movie on another French channel : a silly James Bond with Brosnan (I am not talking about the real Bonds with Connery(please it's the end of holidays, wake up !).

    Now, this work doesn't reek, it's enjoyable, and energetic, in spite of its inability to be great. But it tries too hard to reach for that greatness, while still holding on to the life raft. Charlie Sheen never had it in him to be great. He was good, in many performances, in many different roles, but he is not capable of greatness on screen. The same can be said for Donald Sutherland. His son Keifer is far more talented, far more believable in roles as something great. Even when that something embodies a terrible darkness. This work, like its actors, tries to be great in its story, action, and political posturing, but like most who posture, it can lead nowhere, as posturing is not being, it's pretending to be. And that's all this movie could ever hope to achieve. The action is good, the story is good, the performances are good, and the characters are well written, but well written and good is all this has to give. It rates a 5.2/10 from... the Fiend :.

    This all looked quite promising. An up-and-coming Presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders, as he has been tipped off that a conspiracy is going on within the White House. It stars the excellent Donald Sutherland among several capable actors. Yet very few people have a good word to say about it. The whole thing really needed some depth. You can pick up the idea that the President is being too left-wing with his ideas, and some within the Government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out. Conrad appears to simply want the country to be Governed his way, rather than the way of the elected leader. However, the action scenes had a few logic holes - the sewers and elevators already mentioned, and the rather haphazard assassination method - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely uninspired. Her 'the President's my Father' 'diversion' was ludicrous - that would make the President about 10 when that happened. Worse still was her predictable final scene with Bishop. They could have made a challenging, inventive political thriller, but either bottled it or failed. They could've gone to town on special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They could have achieved so much more in general. This was barely worth the &pound;1 it cost me.

    This film starts with a pedestrian setup before blundering into the standard sort of suspense action where an office worker keeps beating up trained secret service men etc. I couldn't say the acting was bad - there were some good "surprised" faces by Hamilton and Sheen - but then I really wouldn't have to. Risible finale did at least give me a good laugh for my pains. Still, if my life was flashing before my eyes, I think I would fast forward this 90 minutes. I have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published. Yes, very resistant suit that sheen wears. I made a special promise to myself never to watch a film this bad again.

    ***SPOILERS*** The film "Shadow Conspirsey" comes across like a combination of "Three Days of the Condor" & "The Terminator" with this Arnold Schwarzenegger like hit man known as "the Agent", Stephen Lang, who despite unlike Arnold, in the aforementioned movie, being human seems to be indestructible as well as not answering to the both laws of nature or those of the, local as well as national, Justice Department! This mechanical like goon who never says a word throughout the entire movie goes around killing people at will with nobody able or willing to stop him. That's until he starts to tangle with the star of the show or film top presidential adviser Bobby Bishop, Charlie Sheen. What we find out almost as soon as the movie begins is that in the pay CIA contractor Prof.Yuri Pochenko, Theodore Bikel, uncovers a plot to knock off the President of the United States played by a very stiff looking Sam Waterman. It's President Sam who's about to cut off all military spending and used that money to improve the lives of the American people: Way to go Pres! It's then that "The Agent" is unpleased to put an end to Prof. Pochenko's group of dedicated and loyal Americans attempt to expose this group of men high up in the government and military by murdering them including Prof. Pochenko! That's before Prof.Pochenko let the cat out of the bag by getting in touch with Bobby Bishop about their evil plans that they have for the nation. Now a marked man and with Washington Herald top investigative reporter Amanda Givens played by Linda Hamilton, who also stared in the similar robot zombie assassin flick "The Termanator", joining him in exposing this shadow conspiracy Booby has no one to turn to. In that everyone he trusts even his mentor and good friend White House insider Jacob Conred, Donald Southerland, can very well be part of the conspiracy! It's the non stop action that saves the movie from putting you to sleep in that its plot is so full of holes and inconsistencies that it makes no sense at all. Bobby & Amanda eventually get to the bottom of what's happening after a number of unbelievable escapes that it takes the suspense out of the movie in knowing that whatever dangers they face, and it's a lot, they'll always literately come up, like in the exciting elevator scene, smelling like roses! ***SPOILERS*** The final scene when "The Agent" is about to ice the President and his entire cabinet, even those involved in the conspiracy to ice him, has to be seen to be believed. Using a remote controlled toy attack helicopter, much the attack hellfire drones now used in Afghanistan and Yemen, "The Agent" turns Washington D.C into a free fire zone! Eeven though in the end the good's guys lead by Bobby & Amanda save the day as well as the Presdent's life all they end up getting for their heroic efforts is some time off from their jobs to play a game of basketball!

    A lively little B-Movie political thriller that utilizes high-tech surveillance but is hampered by a low-budget. An energetic exercise with not much intrigue but a whole lot of gun-play. A psycho-killer and a band of conspirators, that are rarely really referenced or fleshed out, attempt to pull of a presidential assassination, so they turn D.C. into a mini war zone chasing one potential foe. The reason for this is not very clear and the convenient contrivances abound. But it all doesn't matter in this nifty looking movie that has a good deal of style and it is relentless in its montage of cat and mouse shenanigans. Never boring, and that makes up for its limitations and easy essaying.

    . . . . and, of course, you don't have to drive, you're with friends who have a sense of humor, and you all see nothing wrong with throwing crushed beer cans at the TV while you're all hooting and hollering at this really stupid movie. Just be prepared to watch the following, among just a few examples: Charlie, our hero, is fleeing down the fire escape from a murder scene in an apartment building, jumps into Linda's Jeep (or whatever) and they're speeding away. Suddenly, the assassin, who was several floors up in the building just a second ago, is now on the canvass top of the Jeep, stabbing through the top with a knife, and trying to murder Charlie for some reason. Meanwhile, Linda, who's driving, is careening down the Washington, D.C. street, swerving around heavy traffic. And nobody cares; nobody honks their horn, and the assassin doesn't seem to have a care in the world that he's on public display on the top of a Jeep careening down a major roadway in Washington, D.C. with a knife trying to murder Charlie. Within the White House, Donald Sotherland is told that Charlie is inside the building. Donald, in a strong and commanding voice,demands that they "Turn on the silent alarm!" So, they turn on the "silent alarm" and hundreds of little tiny red lights begin to flash in all the White House hallways, ceilings and walls in every room. Charlie sees the red, flashing lights and cries to Linda, "They've turned on the silent alarm!!!!" Kinda defeats the purpose of a silent alarm, don't ya think? Or, how about next when Charlie and Linda are being chased and shot at by all the security and plain clothes guys in the White House for some reason. They escape by entering the White House's sub-basement labyrinth of heating, air-conditioning and ventilation tunnels, with directional signs pointing out the turns back to the White House, or on to the Treasury Department, or on to The Executive Office Building. Well, Charlie and Linda finalize their escape by simply pushing open a grate and climbing out and onto a D.C. avenue. The message for everybody is that if you don't want to stand in line for a White House tour, just open any grate in the street and follow the directional signs to the White House (or, to the Treasury Building, if you're so inclined). Throughout the movie, Charlie and later Linda, are being chased and shot at in very public places. Yet the D.C. police, and the government, still think they're the bad guys. Get real. And finally, the assassin has been spending the entire movie creating some unknown but diabolical device for some reason. We finally discover he's gonna assassinate the president. How? The prez is to speak at a toy convention. The device is a remote-controlled toy helicopter, around 18-inches in length. It has two lethal machine guns that are killing just about everybody in the convention center but the prez. Though lethal, the powerful bullets have no kick-back at all, and the toy helicopter maintains its steady, deadly but inaccurate course. The day is saved when Charlie releases a net of toy red, white and blue balloons intended for the gala big finish, and the deadly helicopter crashes. There are some great actors in this flick. But I just have to wonder if they needed the money to pay off a bookie, or a boat payment, or the kids needed braces.

    This was the last film directed by George P. Cosmatos, a Greek born in Italy, who directed numerous Hollywood action movies and thrillers over the course of 24 years, including several with Greek settings. This one is set entirely in Washington, D.C., and it is a cracking conspiracy thriller about traitors inside the White House. The hero (who spends most of his time on the run from an assassin hired by the conspirators) is played by Charlie Sheen. Linda Hamilton plays a Washington political journalist with whom he is involved on and off, and they become co-fugitives. The dominant presence in this film, however, is that of Donald Sutherland, who acts circles round everyone else, as a security chief. Theodore Bikel has a bit part as a Russian scholar living in the USA who gets killed at the beginning of the story because he has discovered the traitors. Ben Gazzarra plays a character who stands around tables at the White House looking important and smug, but I did not understand until I looked at the credits on IMDb that he was meant to be the Vice President. The President is played by Sam Waterson, but he too is just a supporting character in the story. Gore Vidal has a fleeting bit part as a Congressman. The film contains an excess of action and not enough story. But it is very tense and 'thrilling' as a thriller should be, so it works within its genre. Charlie Sheen is very convincing as a young Special Assistant to the President who is constantly on the run because he has discovered the traitors who wish to assassinate the President. The assassin who keeps trying to kill him is played by Stephen Lang, who is absolutely terrifying, though why he wears a long white coat down to his ankles, thereby attracting a lot of attention to himself, is a mystery. (Aren't assassins supposed to be inconspicuous?) And how does he stow all of those guns under that flimsy coat? And how does he not get stopped by the police when he is shooting all those innocent bystanders in the streets like that? Oh, well, it's only a movie.

    This is one of those movies whose cast and trailer sound promising, only to drop the ball altogether when you watch it. It is no surprise it bombed miserably on the ticket booth. It was yet another conspiracy movie of they stream that peaked with Enemy of State in the mid-1990s. The Soviets and communists used to offer an easy, credible enemy to write a thriller movie about, so "average" plots could fit well on the screen. Without Soviets around, it became tricky to explore other enemies, and many movies were shot around that time with internal conspiracies within the US government. The cast is not bad at all, on the contrary, it is quite respectful. Photography is lackluster, though, and the characters are just not credible. The first 5 minutes are definitively the only salvageable part of the movie. As usual in this type of movie, the real intentions and objectives of characters are not clear from the beginning and there are some twists. Again, unfortunately those twists happen without any explanation or any crescendo that leads to them. It gives the viewer the impression that they needed to turn a "good guy" into a "bad guy" and just did it in a frustrating way. Were the cast not a A- cast as this is, it would have been a trash movie. The cast, indeed, did a good job on containing damage and ameliorating the failure this movie is.

The prez is to speak at a toy convention. The device is a remote-controlled toy helicopter, around 18-inches in length. It has two lethal machine guns that are killing just about everybody in the convention center but the prez. Though lethal, the powerful bullets have no kick-back at all, and the toy helicopter maintains its steady, deadly but inaccurate course. The day is saved when Charlie releases a net of toy red, white and blue balloons intended for the gala big finish, and the deadly helicopter crashes. There are some great actors in this flick. But I just have to wonder if they needed the money to pay off a bookie, or a boat payment, or the kids needed braces.

    This was the last film directed by George P. Cosmatos, a Greek born in Italy, who directed numerous Hollywood action movies and thrillers over the course of 24 years, including several with Greek settings. This one is set entirely in Washington, D.C., and it is a cracking conspiracy thriller about traitors inside the White House. The hero (who spends most of his time on the run from an assassin hired by the conspirators) is played by Charlie Sheen. Linda Hamilton plays a Washington political journalist with whom he is involved on and off, and they become co-fugitives. The dominant presence in this film, however, is that of Donald Sutherland, who acts circles round everyone else, as a security chief. Theodore Bikel has a bit part as a Russian scholar living in the USA who gets killed at the beginning of the story because he has discovered the traitors. Ben Gazzarra plays a character who stands around tables at the White House looking important and smug, but I did not understand until I looked at the credits on IMDb that he was meant to be the Vice President. The President is played by Sam Waterson, but he too is just a supporting character in the story. Gore Vidal has a fleeting bit part as a Congressman. The film contains an excess of action and not enough story. But it is very tense and 'thrilling' as a thriller should be, so it works within its genre. Charlie Sheen is very convincing as a young Special Assistant to the President who is constantly on the run because he has discovered the traitors who wish to assassinate the President. The assassin who keeps trying to kill him is played by Stephen Lang, who is absolutely terrifying, though why he wears a long white coat down to his ankles, thereby attracting a lot of attention to himself, is a mystery. (Aren't assassins supposed to be inconspicuous?) And how does he stow all of those guns under that flimsy coat? And how does he not get stopped by the police when he is shooting all those innocent bystanders in the streets like that? Oh, well, it's only a movie.

    This is one of those movies whose cast and trailer sound promising, only to drop the ball altogether when you watch it. It is no surprise it bombed miserably on the ticket booth. It was yet another conspiracy movie of they stream that peaked with Enemy of State in the mid-1990s. The Soviets and communists used to offer an easy, credible enemy to write a thriller movie about, so "average" plots could fit well on the screen. Without Soviets around, it became tricky to explore other enemies, and many movies were shot around that time with internal conspiracies within the US government. The cast is not bad at all, on the contrary, it is quite respectful. Photography is lackluster, though, and the characters are just not credible. The first 5 minutes are definitively the only salvageable part of the movie. As usual in this type of movie, the real intentions and objectives of characters are not clear from the beginning and there are some twists. Again, unfortunately those twists happen without any explanation or any crescendo that leads to them. It gives the viewer the impression that they needed to turn a "good guy" into a "bad guy" and just did it in a frustrating way. Were the cast not a A- cast as this is, it would have been a trash movie. The cast, indeed, did a good job on containing damage and ameliorating the failure this movie is.

    My Take: Routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. A rarely seen political thriller, which made a very poor box-office response, I managed to catch THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY on TV just now, and while I was glad that I satisfied my curiosity to see this rare film, I didn't exactly feel this film was all special. Considering the box-office response to it, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not all quite as bad as critics and the public reacted to it, but still ain't very good to begin with and everything, from script to direction, is pretty predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the presidential assistant who finds himself caught up with assassins and chases (a lot of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy which lurks amongst the White House staff. After a professor is murdered, Sheen aids the help of ex-flame reporter Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) to uncover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title. But this script, written by Adi Hasak & Ric Gibbs, are pedestrian as they come, not much differing from other White House conspiracy thrillers as in ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER AT 1600. Some considerable talents (Donald Sutherland, Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) try their best on a routine script, but rarely saves it from predictability of the script. Not to mention a ludicrous scene which involves a toy helicopter, which seems far too silly and out-of-place in this "serious" political thriller. THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its moments I'm sure, some of which are much to under-appreciated (director George Pan Cosmatos serves up some decent chase scenes), but none of which lifts this routine thriller of which there's not much payoff or surprises. Rating: ** out of 5.

    I would have liked to put 0.5 but unfortunately I can't. Who can write so bad scripts (I saw the movie five seconds and knew the "bad boy" would be Sutherland - needed to pay his taxes, when you see how good he was in Redford's movie, "Ordinary People" and others ! -). Though I don't like it, but I had no choice, I saw the movie in French, but I know that hearing the real voices of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton would have not change things, except maybe making it more pitiful. What makes me sick is that people earn their living making this bad stuff (I forgot to speak about Mr Waterson, far away from the Woody Allen's movies he once used to play in). We had another movie on another French channel : a silly James Bond with Brosnan (I am not talking about the real Bonds with Connery(please it's the end of holidays, wake up !).

    Now, this work doesn't reek, it's enjoyable, and energetic, in spite of its inability to be great. But it tries too hard to reach for that greatness, while still holding on to the life raft. Charlie Sheen never had it in him to be great. He was good, in many performances, in many different roles, but he is not capable of greatness on screen. The same can be said for Donald Sutherland. His son Keifer is far more talented, far more believable in roles as something great. Even when that something embodies a terrible darkness. This work, like its actors, tries to be great in its story, action, and political posturing, but like most who posture, it can lead nowhere, as posturing is not being, it's pretending to be. And that's all this movie could ever hope to achieve. The action is good, the story is good, the performances are good, and the characters are well written, but well written and good is all this has to give. It rates a 5.2/10 from... the Fiend :.

    This all looked quite promising. An up-and-coming Presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders, as he has been tipped off that a conspiracy is going on within the White House. It stars the excellent Donald Sutherland among several capable actors. Yet very few people have a good word to say about it. The whole thing really needed some depth. You can pick up the idea that the President is being too left-wing with his ideas, and some within the Government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out. Conrad appears to simply want the country to be Governed his way, rather than the way of the elected leader. However, the action scenes had a few logic holes - the sewers and elevators already mentioned, and the rather haphazard assassination method - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely uninspired. Her 'the President's my Father' 'diversion' was ludicrous - that would make the President about 10 when that happened. Worse still was her predictable final scene with Bishop. They could have made a challenging, inventive political thriller, but either bottled it or failed. They could've gone to town on special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They could have achieved so much more in general. This was barely worth the &pound;1 it cost me.

    This film starts with a pedestrian setup before blundering into the standard sort of suspense action where an office worker keeps beating up trained secret service men etc. I couldn't say the acting was bad - there were some good "surprised" faces by Hamilton and Sheen - but then I really wouldn't have to. Risible finale did at least give me a good laugh for my pains. Still, if my life was flashing before my eyes, I think I would fast forward this 90 minutes. I have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published. Yes, very resistant suit that sheen wears. I made a special promise to myself never to watch a film this bad again.
