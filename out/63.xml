    This movie really captures the true spirit of Christmas. Tim Allen does a wonderful job in it, and I think he was perfect for this role, I can't imagine anyone else in it. One night during the Christmas season Santa falls off of a man's roof, and can't continue his duties, Tim Allen's character is now bestowed the duty of becoming the new Santa Claus, at first he doesn't want to do it, presumably because of all the responsibility that comes with it. but as we go on , he gradually get's used to the idea, he has a little boy that he loves very much and maybe things could be really good now that he's Santa, one problem tho the boy tells his mother that dad is Santa, and the mother doesn't believe him and things don't' go well in the beginning,, I will leave it at that,, but I just wanna say that this is a movie for all ages, and captures the true spirit of the season.

    Ever since I was a child, I always had a fascination with Christmas. The trees, the snow, and the lights -- to me it was an escape from the harshness of reality. And yes - I guess my views on this film can be viewed as biased. (God - I wish they would make more movies like this. Just the magic of it, I do not see it anymore in Christmas films.) When I first sat down to watch this film, I got instantaneously sucked into it. It's just a great film from the moment it starts to the very end (I wish the other 2 sequels were as great but unfortunately, they are huge letdowns.) I really can't imagine this film with anybody but Tim Allen. And when I read that Disney did not allow anybody to work in their films with a criminal record; I was really glad that they decided to make an exception to their policy. Unlike Scott who first put on the Santa suit (upon accidentally killing Santa Clause) and regretted it - you won't regret putting this film on play.

    This is a delightful Christmas movie which my wife and I savoured on Christmas Eve, not having watched it before (and how many Christmas films can you say that about)? Like all the best Yuletide films, it requires the viewer to take a leap of faith and believe the unbelievable so that once you do that you're taken along for the ride and in this case, an entertaining and amusing ride it certainly is. Tim Allen stars as the divorced dad who feels diminished next to his ex-wife and her new man, who naturally is younger, better-looking and higher-earning, though with a taste for gaudily patterned pullovers. Even his relationship with his young son is beginning to pall, despite his best, if misguided efforts but when his rival, a myth-defying, dream-denying psychiatrist attempts to brainwash young Charlie that Santa doesn't exist, it's obvious that it's going to take something exceptional for him to turn the situation around. Cue a fateful encounter with an unexpected visitor on the roof on Christmas Eve and the fun really starts. While some of the special-effects are a little weak, in general this movie gently and neatly encapsulates the elusive Christmas spirit with a nicely judged mix of childish wonder and knowing humour for grown-ups,making it an easy film for parents and children to watch together. Neat touches abound, with pointy-eared elves turning up everywhere, running gags inserted into the narrative and some pleasing sight gags (I liked especially the cops map of the area surrounding Allen's house as they set up the Santa sting, a do-nut shop prominently highlighted for easy reference). Allen makes for a believable, under-achieving dad who eventually accepts his transformation and so wins back his son's affection. The child actor playing his son too I found refreshingly cute-free. Interestingly, the story has no real baddie to pitch them up against, unless you're going to vilify Judge Reinhold for denying Santa's existence. Watching this pleasant and amusing film certainly set our household up for this coming Christmas in what I certainly rate as one of the superior Christmas-themed films.

    Yes, Santa Claus does die in Santa Clause. It is need for the plot of Scott Calvin (Tim Allen). Scott Calvin is spending some time with his son Charlie on Christmas Eve when he hears something on the roof. It turns out to be Santa Claus whom Allen's character accidentally kills by yelling at him. Santa Claus lost his footing and fell off the roof to his death. Surprising, the movie is very okay with showing death so heartily. There is something wrong with that. There was no mention of whom the guy was, or anything. He's dead, and that's all we needed to know. Scott Calvin finds himself responsible for resuming his duties. At the North Pole, the main elf Bernard tells Scott that according to the "Santa Clause" law, is now required by law to take on Santa's identity. After Charlie tells his mom and child-psychologist stepfather Neil (Judge Reinhold), they're convinced that Charlie has been warped by his dad. While the movie treat Neal who takes a doubtful position on Santa's reality not into a jerk like other holiday films nor does the ex-wife is a love interest. Months do pass and Scott transforms into Santa, until court hearings decide that he's nuts and cut off his visitation rights. Another December 24 approaches and Scott must convince his employers and ex that he's not crazy, and that he is Santa Claus. The premise for "The Santa Clause," written by Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick and directed by John Pasquin, is a clever one, and the movie is not without real charm. The Santa Clause launched Tim Allen in the movie business, spawned two sequels, and did so much for the holidays. It had great storyline with great characters. Aided by excellent special effects, he really does look like he's changing to St. Nick. The movie has the funny romp through the misadventures of an average man trying to cope with his unexpected transformation into Santa Claus. The jokes about him changing are just as funny for adults as for kids. The movie also has depth in the relationship of father and son who love each other during custody hearing. Still some people may be disappointed that this movie overlooks the religious significance of Christmas in favor of present-giving and childhood wish-fulfillment, but the movie ends on an appropriate note of good will and reconciliation. The child actor playing Charles (Eric Lloyd) is just annoying who whines his way unconvincingly throughout the film. Still Charles was able to explain some Santa Claus questions when judged by Neil. I like how the film tackles the Santa Claus questions to the myths by an intriguing theory, handled in a throwaway line of dialogue, to explain how Santa is able to do what he can do. One thing that needs to be mention is about the presents magically appears under the tree. It's one of the biggest plot holes; every parent turns a blind eye to the extra presents under the tree. In the film, Santa is real, but the adults don't believe he is real, how can they think he's not real exactly when toys just magically show up. Sadly this is my opinion, the first and only good Tim Allen movie role besides voicing Buzz Light year in Toy Story. He could have done better, as the sequels to this are not that great. It's a great watch, but probably only good watching it once in the holidays.

    Scott Calvin is disgusted to learn that his ex and her husband have tried to break it to son Charlie that Santa isn't real. On Christmas Eve, Scott reads The Night Before Christmas... then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof. When he's startled by Scott's calling out and falls, Santa vanishes leaving only an 8-reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does, and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group who claim they're elves that he is now Santa. Charlie is proud of his dad's new job, though Scott's convinced it's a dream. Until his hair turns white, his beard refuses to stay shaved, he gains weight inexplicably, even for his sudden love of junk food..... Less of a Christmas movie and more of a starring role for Allen to make it big in Hollywood, the film mildly succeeds on both accounts, after all this is Allens second franchise with Disney, and the film profited enough to garner more sequels. But it hasn't aged well, like other classic Christmas movies and its due to the sarcastic tone and yuppie attitude Calvin has during the first act. This was boring in 1995, and watching it with my daughter seventeen years later, she was losing interest very fast. The film does redeem itself when we reach the north pole, but the adult humour and the childish tones do not bond well. It's a good film to watch one cold Christmas afternoon, Allen is a presence and the support is great. Just not brilliant enough to be a Christmas classic

    Having seen all 3 in the series, this is still the best one. But like a lot of Disney movies, ironically, someone (or an animal character) has to die in the story? Why couldn't Santa just have retired instead of slipping on the icy roof and "disappearing"? Well, it seems that this started out as a "Hollywood Films" Disney movie which was intended to be more like a "Christmas Vacation-style" film with adult humor and became "Disneyfied". Ultimately, this was a very good thing. (Originally, SC was to have shot Santa with a shotgun, as a rooftop burglar.) Scott Calvin becomes the Santa replacement because of the "Santa Clause": He who causes the current Santa to be unable to perform his duties must take his place; and he faces numerous comic dilemmas: Santa weight gain, bushy white facial hair, disbelief by all. The cleverly-written script carries the movie along and the airborne elves at the end are very ingenious. Santa Clause 2 (which Disney didn't run on cable this year) is a bit "off". It's too weird. The plastic duplicate Santa has a nightmarish "Frankenstein" quality to it. SC courting "Mrs. Claus" is the only saving-grace of Santa 2. Seeing SC's kid turn into a juvenile delinquent is a real downer. Comet the Reindeer is hilarious and steals the show. So candy bars make him fat, but why the "potty" humor? The "rip-off" ending from Laurel & Hardy's "March of the Wooden Soldiers" shows a great lack of originality here. It's been done before-in the 1930's. Santa Clause 3 is actually better than #2, but once again, it steals the plot from another film. This time, it steals the "Jack Frost" villain from an old Rankin-Bass animated short: "Frosty the Snowman." However, Martin Short is very good as Jack Frost and I personally like it better than Santa Clause 2. However, the out-takes over the ending credits spoil the "magic" of a Santa film. Enough already, please no more Santa Clause movies. (I can see it all now: Santa Clause 4: Scott Calvin's kid takes over the role after old SC has a heart attack from eating too many cookies and drinking too much hot chocolate. Judy the Elf takes over for the Mrs.--Good Grief!)

    Tim Allen, Judge Reinhold, Wendy Crewson, Eric Lloyd, David Krumholtz and Peter Boyle star in this 1994 comedy. Scott Calvin (Allen) is a divorced dad and toy exec who is getting ready to spend Christmas Eve with his son, Charlie (Lloyd). After Santa Claus falls off his roof, Scott takes the job of Santa and he and Charlie head off to the North Pole. When arriving, Scott is told by head elf, Bernard (Krumholtz) about the "Santa Clause," which means when he puts on the suit he becomes the big guy and accepts the responsibility. Scott eventually realizes that it's not a dream and he's really Santa. Crewson plays his ex-wife, Laura, Reinhold plays her psychiatrist husband, Neil Miller and Boyle plays Scott's boss. I think this is one of the best holiday films and Tim is great in it. I recommend this.

    This was the only Santa Clause I enjoyed out of the three that had came out. I believe that this one was the most entertaining of the three. I think the key aspect to a movie is the beginning, and the beginning and middle were the most entertaining to me in this movie. The end was good, but to me, it started getting a bit silly. I won't spoil anything, but after the mid-section of the movie was done, it wasn't so whimsical and amusing anymore. In the beginning and middle of the movie, it's all about Tim Allen not believing that he is Santa Clause, and I find that quite humorous because that's what any person would probably do. However, overall this movie does deserve a 7/10 and I definitely recommend watching it for families, because this is a 100% family approved film!

    Watching this film,we may have a different attitude on the most important part of holidays;Scott Calvin (Allen), is a divorced father trying to share Christmas with his son Charlie(Eric Loyd).The moment of reality arises,when an unfortunate accident makes doubting Scott a new Santa. Through the film,Scott changes and grows more like the Santa image we all perceive to be real.As the medical community holds true to facts,Dr. Miller (Reinhold) is a noted psychiatrist.He feels the need to guide his stepson towards an honest path. The elves guide the new Santa, in following scheduled time.Towards the end,we see Charlie and his family become adamant believers in "Jolly Old Saint Nick".I love this film, and am tickled pink at the joy and love it embodies.

    Scott had to look after his son after his ex-wife and new husband drop him off. The night he stay over, he then accident scare Santa and he falls of the roof and he himself become Santa Claus. As his son on trip to north pole, next day where no believe the kids, was little sad that no one believe him as not that enjoyable to watch. also went to Over the top with the elves with attitude, I found a bit silly however you can say think about small elves that look kids but can be 300 years old?, those elves did not bother me. This well acted and well paced movie and some very hilarious moment in this movie and a nice ending as well. 7 out of 10

After Santa Claus falls off his roof, Scott takes the job of Santa and he and Charlie head off to the North Pole. When arriving, Scott is told by head elf, Bernard (Krumholtz) about the "Santa Clause," which means when he puts on the suit he becomes the big guy and accepts the responsibility. Scott eventually realizes that it's not a dream and he's really Santa. Crewson plays his ex-wife, Laura, Reinhold plays her psychiatrist husband, Neil Miller and Boyle plays Scott's boss. I think this is one of the best holiday films and Tim is great in it. I recommend this.

    This was the only Santa Clause I enjoyed out of the three that had came out. I believe that this one was the most entertaining of the three. I think the key aspect to a movie is the beginning, and the beginning and middle were the most entertaining to me in this movie. The end was good, but to me, it started getting a bit silly. I won't spoil anything, but after the mid-section of the movie was done, it wasn't so whimsical and amusing anymore. In the beginning and middle of the movie, it's all about Tim Allen not believing that he is Santa Clause, and I find that quite humorous because that's what any person would probably do. However, overall this movie does deserve a 7/10 and I definitely recommend watching it for families, because this is a 100% family approved film!

    Watching this film,we may have a different attitude on the most important part of holidays;Scott Calvin (Allen), is a divorced father trying to share Christmas with his son Charlie(Eric Loyd).The moment of reality arises,when an unfortunate accident makes doubting Scott a new Santa. Through the film,Scott changes and grows more like the Santa image we all perceive to be real.As the medical community holds true to facts,Dr. Miller (Reinhold) is a noted psychiatrist.He feels the need to guide his stepson towards an honest path. The elves guide the new Santa, in following scheduled time.Towards the end,we see Charlie and his family become adamant believers in "Jolly Old Saint Nick".I love this film, and am tickled pink at the joy and love it embodies.

    Scott had to look after his son after his ex-wife and new husband drop him off. The night he stay over, he then accident scare Santa and he falls of the roof and he himself become Santa Claus. As his son on trip to north pole, next day where no believe the kids, was little sad that no one believe him as not that enjoyable to watch. also went to Over the top with the elves with attitude, I found a bit silly however you can say think about small elves that look kids but can be 300 years old?, those elves did not bother me. This well acted and well paced movie and some very hilarious moment in this movie and a nice ending as well. 7 out of 10

    This movie really captures the true spirit of Christmas. Tim Allen does a wonderful job in it, and I think he was perfect for this role, I can't imagine anyone else in it. One night during the Christmas season Santa falls off of a man's roof, and can't continue his duties, Tim Allen's character is now bestowed the duty of becoming the new Santa Claus, at first he doesn't want to do it, presumably because of all the responsibility that comes with it. but as we go on , he gradually get's used to the idea, he has a little boy that he loves very much and maybe things could be really good now that he's Santa, one problem tho the boy tells his mother that dad is Santa, and the mother doesn't believe him and things don't' go well in the beginning,, I will leave it at that,, but I just wanna say that this is a movie for all ages, and captures the true spirit of the season.

    Ever since I was a child, I always had a fascination with Christmas. The trees, the snow, and the lights -- to me it was an escape from the harshness of reality. And yes - I guess my views on this film can be viewed as biased. (God - I wish they would make more movies like this. Just the magic of it, I do not see it anymore in Christmas films.) When I first sat down to watch this film, I got instantaneously sucked into it. It's just a great film from the moment it starts to the very end (I wish the other 2 sequels were as great but unfortunately, they are huge letdowns.) I really can't imagine this film with anybody but Tim Allen. And when I read that Disney did not allow anybody to work in their films with a criminal record; I was really glad that they decided to make an exception to their policy. Unlike Scott who first put on the Santa suit (upon accidentally killing Santa Clause) and regretted it - you won't regret putting this film on play.

    This is a delightful Christmas movie which my wife and I savoured on Christmas Eve, not having watched it before (and how many Christmas films can you say that about)? Like all the best Yuletide films, it requires the viewer to take a leap of faith and believe the unbelievable so that once you do that you're taken along for the ride and in this case, an entertaining and amusing ride it certainly is. Tim Allen stars as the divorced dad who feels diminished next to his ex-wife and her new man, who naturally is younger, better-looking and higher-earning, though with a taste for gaudily patterned pullovers. Even his relationship with his young son is beginning to pall, despite his best, if misguided efforts but when his rival, a myth-defying, dream-denying psychiatrist attempts to brainwash young Charlie that Santa doesn't exist, it's obvious that it's going to take something exceptional for him to turn the situation around. Cue a fateful encounter with an unexpected visitor on the roof on Christmas Eve and the fun really starts. While some of the special-effects are a little weak, in general this movie gently and neatly encapsulates the elusive Christmas spirit with a nicely judged mix of childish wonder and knowing humour for grown-ups,making it an easy film for parents and children to watch together. Neat touches abound, with pointy-eared elves turning up everywhere, running gags inserted into the narrative and some pleasing sight gags (I liked especially the cops map of the area surrounding Allen's house as they set up the Santa sting, a do-nut shop prominently highlighted for easy reference). Allen makes for a believable, under-achieving dad who eventually accepts his transformation and so wins back his son's affection. The child actor playing his son too I found refreshingly cute-free. Interestingly, the story has no real baddie to pitch them up against, unless you're going to vilify Judge Reinhold for denying Santa's existence. Watching this pleasant and amusing film certainly set our household up for this coming Christmas in what I certainly rate as one of the superior Christmas-themed films.

    Yes, Santa Claus does die in Santa Clause. It is need for the plot of Scott Calvin (Tim Allen). Scott Calvin is spending some time with his son Charlie on Christmas Eve when he hears something on the roof. It turns out to be Santa Claus whom Allen's character accidentally kills by yelling at him. Santa Claus lost his footing and fell off the roof to his death. Surprising, the movie is very okay with showing death so heartily. There is something wrong with that. There was no mention of whom the guy was, or anything. He's dead, and that's all we needed to know. Scott Calvin finds himself responsible for resuming his duties. At the North Pole, the main elf Bernard tells Scott that according to the "Santa Clause" law, is now required by law to take on Santa's identity. After Charlie tells his mom and child-psychologist stepfather Neil (Judge Reinhold), they're convinced that Charlie has been warped by his dad. While the movie treat Neal who takes a doubtful position on Santa's reality not into a jerk like other holiday films nor does the ex-wife is a love interest. Months do pass and Scott transforms into Santa, until court hearings decide that he's nuts and cut off his visitation rights. Another December 24 approaches and Scott must convince his employers and ex that he's not crazy, and that he is Santa Claus. The premise for "The Santa Clause," written by Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick and directed by John Pasquin, is a clever one, and the movie is not without real charm. The Santa Clause launched Tim Allen in the movie business, spawned two sequels, and did so much for the holidays. It had great storyline with great characters. Aided by excellent special effects, he really does look like he's changing to St. Nick. The movie has the funny romp through the misadventures of an average man trying to cope with his unexpected transformation into Santa Claus. The jokes about him changing are just as funny for adults as for kids. The movie also has depth in the relationship of father and son who love each other during custody hearing. Still some people may be disappointed that this movie overlooks the religious significance of Christmas in favor of present-giving and childhood wish-fulfillment, but the movie ends on an appropriate note of good will and reconciliation. The child actor playing Charles (Eric Lloyd) is just annoying who whines his way unconvincingly throughout the film. Still Charles was able to explain some Santa Claus questions when judged by Neil. I like how the film tackles the Santa Claus questions to the myths by an intriguing theory, handled in a throwaway line of dialogue, to explain how Santa is able to do what he can do. One thing that needs to be mention is about the presents magically appears under the tree. It's one of the biggest plot holes; every parent turns a blind eye to the extra presents under the tree. In the film, Santa is real, but the adults don't believe he is real, how can they think he's not real exactly when toys just magically show up. Sadly this is my opinion, the first and only good Tim Allen movie role besides voicing Buzz Light year in Toy Story. He could have done better, as the sequels to this are not that great. It's a great watch, but probably only good watching it once in the holidays.

    Scott Calvin is disgusted to learn that his ex and her husband have tried to break it to son Charlie that Santa isn't real. On Christmas Eve, Scott reads The Night Before Christmas... then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof. When he's startled by Scott's calling out and falls, Santa vanishes leaving only an 8-reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does, and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group who claim they're elves that he is now Santa. Charlie is proud of his dad's new job, though Scott's convinced it's a dream. Until his hair turns white, his beard refuses to stay shaved, he gains weight inexplicably, even for his sudden love of junk food..... Less of a Christmas movie and more of a starring role for Allen to make it big in Hollywood, the film mildly succeeds on both accounts, after all this is Allens second franchise with Disney, and the film profited enough to garner more sequels. But it hasn't aged well, like other classic Christmas movies and its due to the sarcastic tone and yuppie attitude Calvin has during the first act. This was boring in 1995, and watching it with my daughter seventeen years later, she was losing interest very fast. The film does redeem itself when we reach the north pole, but the adult humour and the childish tones do not bond well. It's a good film to watch one cold Christmas afternoon, Allen is a presence and the support is great. Just not brilliant enough to be a Christmas classic

    Having seen all 3 in the series, this is still the best one. But like a lot of Disney movies, ironically, someone (or an animal character) has to die in the story? Why couldn't Santa just have retired instead of slipping on the icy roof and "disappearing"? Well, it seems that this started out as a "Hollywood Films" Disney movie which was intended to be more like a "Christmas Vacation-style" film with adult humor and became "Disneyfied". Ultimately, this was a very good thing. (Originally, SC was to have shot Santa with a shotgun, as a rooftop burglar.) Scott Calvin becomes the Santa replacement because of the "Santa Clause": He who causes the current Santa to be unable to perform his duties must take his place; and he faces numerous comic dilemmas: Santa weight gain, bushy white facial hair, disbelief by all. The cleverly-written script carries the movie along and the airborne elves at the end are very ingenious. Santa Clause 2 (which Disney didn't run on cable this year) is a bit "off". It's too weird. The plastic duplicate Santa has a nightmarish "Frankenstein" quality to it. SC courting "Mrs. Claus" is the only saving-grace of Santa 2. Seeing SC's kid turn into a juvenile delinquent is a real downer. Comet the Reindeer is hilarious and steals the show. So candy bars make him fat, but why the "potty" humor? The "rip-off" ending from Laurel & Hardy's "March of the Wooden Soldiers" shows a great lack of originality here. It's been done before-in the 1930's. Santa Clause 3 is actually better than #2, but once again, it steals the plot from another film. This time, it steals the "Jack Frost" villain from an old Rankin-Bass animated short: "Frosty the Snowman." However, Martin Short is very good as Jack Frost and I personally like it better than Santa Clause 2. However, the out-takes over the ending credits spoil the "magic" of a Santa film. Enough already, please no more Santa Clause movies. (I can see it all now: Santa Clause 4: Scott Calvin's kid takes over the role after old SC has a heart attack from eating too many cookies and drinking too much hot chocolate. Judy the Elf takes over for the Mrs.--Good Grief!)

Scott Calvin becomes the Santa replacement because of the "Santa Clause": He who causes the current Santa to be unable to perform his duties must take his place; and he faces numerous comic dilemmas: Santa weight gain, bushy white facial hair, disbelief by all. The cleverly-written script carries the movie along and the airborne elves at the end are very ingenious. Santa Clause 2 (which Disney didn't run on cable this year) is a bit "off". It's too weird. The plastic duplicate Santa has a nightmarish "Frankenstein" quality to it. SC courting "Mrs. Claus" is the only saving-grace of Santa 2. Seeing SC's kid turn into a juvenile delinquent is a real downer. Comet the Reindeer is hilarious and steals the show. So candy bars make him fat, but why the "potty" humor? The "rip-off" ending from Laurel & Hardy's "March of the Wooden Soldiers" shows a great lack of originality here. It's been done before-in the 1930's. Santa Clause 3 is actually better than #2, but once again, it steals the plot from another film. This time, it steals the "Jack Frost" villain from an old Rankin-Bass animated short: "Frosty the Snowman." However, Martin Short is very good as Jack Frost and I personally like it better than Santa Clause 2. However, the out-takes over the ending credits spoil the "magic" of a Santa film. Enough already, please no more Santa Clause movies. (I can see it all now: Santa Clause 4: Scott Calvin's kid takes over the role after old SC has a heart attack from eating too many cookies and drinking too much hot chocolate. Judy the Elf takes over for the Mrs.--Good Grief!)

    Tim Allen, Judge Reinhold, Wendy Crewson, Eric Lloyd, David Krumholtz and Peter Boyle star in this 1994 comedy. Scott Calvin (Allen) is a divorced dad and toy exec who is getting ready to spend Christmas Eve with his son, Charlie (Lloyd). After Santa Claus falls off his roof, Scott takes the job of Santa and he and Charlie head off to the North Pole. When arriving, Scott is told by head elf, Bernard (Krumholtz) about the "Santa Clause," which means when he puts on the suit he becomes the big guy and accepts the responsibility. Scott eventually realizes that it's not a dream and he's really Santa. Crewson plays his ex-wife, Laura, Reinhold plays her psychiatrist husband, Neil Miller and Boyle plays Scott's boss. I think this is one of the best holiday films and Tim is great in it. I recommend this.

    This was the only Santa Clause I enjoyed out of the three that had came out. I believe that this one was the most entertaining of the three. I think the key aspect to a movie is the beginning, and the beginning and middle were the most entertaining to me in this movie. The end was good, but to me, it started getting a bit silly. I won't spoil anything, but after the mid-section of the movie was done, it wasn't so whimsical and amusing anymore. In the beginning and middle of the movie, it's all about Tim Allen not believing that he is Santa Clause, and I find that quite humorous because that's what any person would probably do. However, overall this movie does deserve a 7/10 and I definitely recommend watching it for families, because this is a 100% family approved film!

    Watching this film,we may have a different attitude on the most important part of holidays;Scott Calvin (Allen), is a divorced father trying to share Christmas with his son Charlie(Eric Loyd).The moment of reality arises,when an unfortunate accident makes doubting Scott a new Santa. Through the film,Scott changes and grows more like the Santa image we all perceive to be real.As the medical community holds true to facts,Dr. Miller (Reinhold) is a noted psychiatrist.He feels the need to guide his stepson towards an honest path. The elves guide the new Santa, in following scheduled time.Towards the end,we see Charlie and his family become adamant believers in "Jolly Old Saint Nick".I love this film, and am tickled pink at the joy and love it embodies.

    Scott had to look after his son after his ex-wife and new husband drop him off. The night he stay over, he then accident scare Santa and he falls of the roof and he himself become Santa Claus. As his son on trip to north pole, next day where no believe the kids, was little sad that no one believe him as not that enjoyable to watch. also went to Over the top with the elves with attitude, I found a bit silly however you can say think about small elves that look kids but can be 300 years old?, those elves did not bother me. This well acted and well paced movie and some very hilarious moment in this movie and a nice ending as well. 7 out of 10

    This movie really captures the true spirit of Christmas. Tim Allen does a wonderful job in it, and I think he was perfect for this role, I can't imagine anyone else in it. One night during the Christmas season Santa falls off of a man's roof, and can't continue his duties, Tim Allen's character is now bestowed the duty of becoming the new Santa Claus, at first he doesn't want to do it, presumably because of all the responsibility that comes with it. but as we go on , he gradually get's used to the idea, he has a little boy that he loves very much and maybe things could be really good now that he's Santa, one problem tho the boy tells his mother that dad is Santa, and the mother doesn't believe him and things don't' go well in the beginning,, I will leave it at that,, but I just wanna say that this is a movie for all ages, and captures the true spirit of the season.

    Ever since I was a child, I always had a fascination with Christmas. The trees, the snow, and the lights -- to me it was an escape from the harshness of reality. And yes - I guess my views on this film can be viewed as biased. (God - I wish they would make more movies like this. Just the magic of it, I do not see it anymore in Christmas films.) When I first sat down to watch this film, I got instantaneously sucked into it. It's just a great film from the moment it starts to the very end (I wish the other 2 sequels were as great but unfortunately, they are huge letdowns.) I really can't imagine this film with anybody but Tim Allen. And when I read that Disney did not allow anybody to work in their films with a criminal record; I was really glad that they decided to make an exception to their policy. Unlike Scott who first put on the Santa suit (upon accidentally killing Santa Clause) and regretted it - you won't regret putting this film on play.

    This is a delightful Christmas movie which my wife and I savoured on Christmas Eve, not having watched it before (and how many Christmas films can you say that about)? Like all the best Yuletide films, it requires the viewer to take a leap of faith and believe the unbelievable so that once you do that you're taken along for the ride and in this case, an entertaining and amusing ride it certainly is. Tim Allen stars as the divorced dad who feels diminished next to his ex-wife and her new man, who naturally is younger, better-looking and higher-earning, though with a taste for gaudily patterned pullovers. Even his relationship with his young son is beginning to pall, despite his best, if misguided efforts but when his rival, a myth-defying, dream-denying psychiatrist attempts to brainwash young Charlie that Santa doesn't exist, it's obvious that it's going to take something exceptional for him to turn the situation around. Cue a fateful encounter with an unexpected visitor on the roof on Christmas Eve and the fun really starts. While some of the special-effects are a little weak, in general this movie gently and neatly encapsulates the elusive Christmas spirit with a nicely judged mix of childish wonder and knowing humour for grown-ups,making it an easy film for parents and children to watch together. Neat touches abound, with pointy-eared elves turning up everywhere, running gags inserted into the narrative and some pleasing sight gags (I liked especially the cops map of the area surrounding Allen's house as they set up the Santa sting, a do-nut shop prominently highlighted for easy reference). Allen makes for a believable, under-achieving dad who eventually accepts his transformation and so wins back his son's affection. The child actor playing his son too I found refreshingly cute-free. Interestingly, the story has no real baddie to pitch them up against, unless you're going to vilify Judge Reinhold for denying Santa's existence. Watching this pleasant and amusing film certainly set our household up for this coming Christmas in what I certainly rate as one of the superior Christmas-themed films.

    Yes, Santa Claus does die in Santa Clause. It is need for the plot of Scott Calvin (Tim Allen). Scott Calvin is spending some time with his son Charlie on Christmas Eve when he hears something on the roof. It turns out to be Santa Claus whom Allen's character accidentally kills by yelling at him. Santa Claus lost his footing and fell off the roof to his death. Surprising, the movie is very okay with showing death so heartily. There is something wrong with that. There was no mention of whom the guy was, or anything. He's dead, and that's all we needed to know. Scott Calvin finds himself responsible for resuming his duties. At the North Pole, the main elf Bernard tells Scott that according to the "Santa Clause" law, is now required by law to take on Santa's identity. After Charlie tells his mom and child-psychologist stepfather Neil (Judge Reinhold), they're convinced that Charlie has been warped by his dad. While the movie treat Neal who takes a doubtful position on Santa's reality not into a jerk like other holiday films nor does the ex-wife is a love interest. Months do pass and Scott transforms into Santa, until court hearings decide that he's nuts and cut off his visitation rights. Another December 24 approaches and Scott must convince his employers and ex that he's not crazy, and that he is Santa Claus. The premise for "The Santa Clause," written by Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick and directed by John Pasquin, is a clever one, and the movie is not without real charm. The Santa Clause launched Tim Allen in the movie business, spawned two sequels, and did so much for the holidays. It had great storyline with great characters. Aided by excellent special effects, he really does look like he's changing to St. Nick. The movie has the funny romp through the misadventures of an average man trying to cope with his unexpected transformation into Santa Claus. The jokes about him changing are just as funny for adults as for kids. The movie also has depth in the relationship of father and son who love each other during custody hearing. Still some people may be disappointed that this movie overlooks the religious significance of Christmas in favor of present-giving and childhood wish-fulfillment, but the movie ends on an appropriate note of good will and reconciliation. The child actor playing Charles (Eric Lloyd) is just annoying who whines his way unconvincingly throughout the film. Still Charles was able to explain some Santa Claus questions when judged by Neil. I like how the film tackles the Santa Claus questions to the myths by an intriguing theory, handled in a throwaway line of dialogue, to explain how Santa is able to do what he can do. One thing that needs to be mention is about the presents magically appears under the tree. It's one of the biggest plot holes; every parent turns a blind eye to the extra presents under the tree. In the film, Santa is real, but the adults don't believe he is real, how can they think he's not real exactly when toys just magically show up. Sadly this is my opinion, the first and only good Tim Allen movie role besides voicing Buzz Light year in Toy Story. He could have done better, as the sequels to this are not that great. It's a great watch, but probably only good watching it once in the holidays.

    Scott Calvin is disgusted to learn that his ex and her husband have tried to break it to son Charlie that Santa isn't real. On Christmas Eve, Scott reads The Night Before Christmas... then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof. When he's startled by Scott's calling out and falls, Santa vanishes leaving only an 8-reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does, and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group who claim they're elves that he is now Santa. Charlie is proud of his dad's new job, though Scott's convinced it's a dream. Until his hair turns white, his beard refuses to stay shaved, he gains weight inexplicably, even for his sudden love of junk food..... Less of a Christmas movie and more of a starring role for Allen to make it big in Hollywood, the film mildly succeeds on both accounts, after all this is Allens second franchise with Disney, and the film profited enough to garner more sequels. But it hasn't aged well, like other classic Christmas movies and its due to the sarcastic tone and yuppie attitude Calvin has during the first act. This was boring in 1995, and watching it with my daughter seventeen years later, she was losing interest very fast. The film does redeem itself when we reach the north pole, but the adult humour and the childish tones do not bond well. It's a good film to watch one cold Christmas afternoon, Allen is a presence and the support is great. Just not brilliant enough to be a Christmas classic

    Having seen all 3 in the series, this is still the best one. But like a lot of Disney movies, ironically, someone (or an animal character) has to die in the story? Why couldn't Santa just have retired instead of slipping on the icy roof and "disappearing"? Well, it seems that this started out as a "Hollywood Films" Disney movie which was intended to be more like a "Christmas Vacation-style" film with adult humor and became "Disneyfied". Ultimately, this was a very good thing. (Originally, SC was to have shot Santa with a shotgun, as a rooftop burglar.) Scott Calvin becomes the Santa replacement because of the "Santa Clause": He who causes the current Santa to be unable to perform his duties must take his place; and he faces numerous comic dilemmas: Santa weight gain, bushy white facial hair, disbelief by all. The cleverly-written script carries the movie along and the airborne elves at the end are very ingenious. Santa Clause 2 (which Disney didn't run on cable this year) is a bit "off". It's too weird. The plastic duplicate Santa has a nightmarish "Frankenstein" quality to it. SC courting "Mrs. Claus" is the only saving-grace of Santa 2. Seeing SC's kid turn into a juvenile delinquent is a real downer. Comet the Reindeer is hilarious and steals the show. So candy bars make him fat, but why the "potty" humor? The "rip-off" ending from Laurel & Hardy's "March of the Wooden Soldiers" shows a great lack of originality here. It's been done before-in the 1930's. Santa Clause 3 is actually better than #2, but once again, it steals the plot from another film. This time, it steals the "Jack Frost" villain from an old Rankin-Bass animated short: "Frosty the Snowman." However, Martin Short is very good as Jack Frost and I personally like it better than Santa Clause 2. However, the out-takes over the ending credits spoil the "magic" of a Santa film. Enough already, please no more Santa Clause movies. (I can see it all now: Santa Clause 4: Scott Calvin's kid takes over the role after old SC has a heart attack from eating too many cookies and drinking too much hot chocolate. Judy the Elf takes over for the Mrs.--Good Grief!)

When he's startled by Scott's calling out and falls, Santa vanishes leaving only an 8-reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does, and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group who claim they're elves that he is now Santa. Charlie is proud of his dad's new job, though Scott's convinced it's a dream. Until his hair turns white, his beard refuses to stay shaved, he gains weight inexplicably, even for his sudden love of junk food..... Less of a Christmas movie and more of a starring role for Allen to make it big in Hollywood, the film mildly succeeds on both accounts, after all this is Allens second franchise with Disney, and the film profited enough to garner more sequels. But it hasn't aged well, like other classic Christmas movies and its due to the sarcastic tone and yuppie attitude Calvin has during the first act. This was boring in 1995, and watching it with my daughter seventeen years later, she was losing interest very fast. The film does redeem itself when we reach the north pole, but the adult humour and the childish tones do not bond well. It's a good film to watch one cold Christmas afternoon, Allen is a presence and the support is great. Just not brilliant enough to be a Christmas classic

    Having seen all 3 in the series, this is still the best one. But like a lot of Disney movies, ironically, someone (or an animal character) has to die in the story? Why couldn't Santa just have retired instead of slipping on the icy roof and "disappearing"? Well, it seems that this started out as a "Hollywood Films" Disney movie which was intended to be more like a "Christmas Vacation-style" film with adult humor and became "Disneyfied". Ultimately, this was a very good thing. (Originally, SC was to have shot Santa with a shotgun, as a rooftop burglar.) Scott Calvin becomes the Santa replacement because of the "Santa Clause": He who causes the current Santa to be unable to perform his duties must take his place; and he faces numerous comic dilemmas: Santa weight gain, bushy white facial hair, disbelief by all. The cleverly-written script carries the movie along and the airborne elves at the end are very ingenious. Santa Clause 2 (which Disney didn't run on cable this year) is a bit "off". It's too weird. The plastic duplicate Santa has a nightmarish "Frankenstein" quality to it. SC courting "Mrs. Claus" is the only saving-grace of Santa 2. Seeing SC's kid turn into a juvenile delinquent is a real downer. Comet the Reindeer is hilarious and steals the show. So candy bars make him fat, but why the "potty" humor? The "rip-off" ending from Laurel & Hardy's "March of the Wooden Soldiers" shows a great lack of originality here. It's been done before-in the 1930's. Santa Clause 3 is actually better than #2, but once again, it steals the plot from another film. This time, it steals the "Jack Frost" villain from an old Rankin-Bass animated short: "Frosty the Snowman." However, Martin Short is very good as Jack Frost and I personally like it better than Santa Clause 2. However, the out-takes over the ending credits spoil the "magic" of a Santa film. Enough already, please no more Santa Clause movies. (I can see it all now: Santa Clause 4: Scott Calvin's kid takes over the role after old SC has a heart attack from eating too many cookies and drinking too much hot chocolate. Judy the Elf takes over for the Mrs.--Good Grief!)

    Tim Allen, Judge Reinhold, Wendy Crewson, Eric Lloyd, David Krumholtz and Peter Boyle star in this 1994 comedy. Scott Calvin (Allen) is a divorced dad and toy exec who is getting ready to spend Christmas Eve with his son, Charlie (Lloyd). After Santa Claus falls off his roof, Scott takes the job of Santa and he and Charlie head off to the North Pole. When arriving, Scott is told by head elf, Bernard (Krumholtz) about the "Santa Clause," which means when he puts on the suit he becomes the big guy and accepts the responsibility. Scott eventually realizes that it's not a dream and he's really Santa. Crewson plays his ex-wife, Laura, Reinhold plays her psychiatrist husband, Neil Miller and Boyle plays Scott's boss. I think this is one of the best holiday films and Tim is great in it. I recommend this.

    This was the only Santa Clause I enjoyed out of the three that had came out. I believe that this one was the most entertaining of the three. I think the key aspect to a movie is the beginning, and the beginning and middle were the most entertaining to me in this movie. The end was good, but to me, it started getting a bit silly. I won't spoil anything, but after the mid-section of the movie was done, it wasn't so whimsical and amusing anymore. In the beginning and middle of the movie, it's all about Tim Allen not believing that he is Santa Clause, and I find that quite humorous because that's what any person would probably do. However, overall this movie does deserve a 7/10 and I definitely recommend watching it for families, because this is a 100% family approved film!

    Scott had to look after his son after his ex-wife and new husband drop him off. The night he stay over, he then accident scare Santa and he falls of the roof and he himself become Santa Claus. As his son on trip to north pole, next day where no believe the kids, was little sad that no one believe him as not that enjoyable to watch. also went to Over the top with the elves with attitude, I found a bit silly however you can say think about small elves that look kids but can be 300 years old?, those elves did not bother me. This well acted and well paced movie and some very hilarious moment in this movie and a nice ending as well. 7 out of 10

    This movie really captures the true spirit of Christmas. Tim Allen does a wonderful job in it, and I think he was perfect for this role, I can't imagine anyone else in it. One night during the Christmas season Santa falls off of a man's roof, and can't continue his duties, Tim Allen's character is now bestowed the duty of becoming the new Santa Claus, at first he doesn't want to do it, presumably because of all the responsibility that comes with it. but as we go on , he gradually get's used to the idea, he has a little boy that he loves very much and maybe things could be really good now that he's Santa, one problem tho the boy tells his mother that dad is Santa, and the mother doesn't believe him and things don't' go well in the beginning,, I will leave it at that,, but I just wanna say that this is a movie for all ages, and captures the true spirit of the season.

    Ever since I was a child, I always had a fascination with Christmas. The trees, the snow, and the lights -- to me it was an escape from the harshness of reality. And yes - I guess my views on this film can be viewed as biased. (God - I wish they would make more movies like this. Just the magic of it, I do not see it anymore in Christmas films.) When I first sat down to watch this film, I got instantaneously sucked into it. It's just a great film from the moment it starts to the very end (I wish the other 2 sequels were as great but unfortunately, they are huge letdowns.) I really can't imagine this film with anybody but Tim Allen. And when I read that Disney did not allow anybody to work in their films with a criminal record; I was really glad that they decided to make an exception to their policy. Unlike Scott who first put on the Santa suit (upon accidentally killing Santa Clause) and regretted it - you won't regret putting this film on play.

    This is a delightful Christmas movie which my wife and I savoured on Christmas Eve, not having watched it before (and how many Christmas films can you say that about)? Like all the best Yuletide films, it requires the viewer to take a leap of faith and believe the unbelievable so that once you do that you're taken along for the ride and in this case, an entertaining and amusing ride it certainly is. Tim Allen stars as the divorced dad who feels diminished next to his ex-wife and her new man, who naturally is younger, better-looking and higher-earning, though with a taste for gaudily patterned pullovers. Even his relationship with his young son is beginning to pall, despite his best, if misguided efforts but when his rival, a myth-defying, dream-denying psychiatrist attempts to brainwash young Charlie that Santa doesn't exist, it's obvious that it's going to take something exceptional for him to turn the situation around. Cue a fateful encounter with an unexpected visitor on the roof on Christmas Eve and the fun really starts. While some of the special-effects are a little weak, in general this movie gently and neatly encapsulates the elusive Christmas spirit with a nicely judged mix of childish wonder and knowing humour for grown-ups,making it an easy film for parents and children to watch together. Neat touches abound, with pointy-eared elves turning up everywhere, running gags inserted into the narrative and some pleasing sight gags (I liked especially the cops map of the area surrounding Allen's house as they set up the Santa sting, a do-nut shop prominently highlighted for easy reference). Allen makes for a believable, under-achieving dad who eventually accepts his transformation and so wins back his son's affection. The child actor playing his son too I found refreshingly cute-free. Interestingly, the story has no real baddie to pitch them up against, unless you're going to vilify Judge Reinhold for denying Santa's existence. Watching this pleasant and amusing film certainly set our household up for this coming Christmas in what I certainly rate as one of the superior Christmas-themed films.

    Yes, Santa Claus does die in Santa Clause. It is need for the plot of Scott Calvin (Tim Allen). Scott Calvin is spending some time with his son Charlie on Christmas Eve when he hears something on the roof. It turns out to be Santa Claus whom Allen's character accidentally kills by yelling at him. Santa Claus lost his footing and fell off the roof to his death. Surprising, the movie is very okay with showing death so heartily. There is something wrong with that. There was no mention of whom the guy was, or anything. He's dead, and that's all we needed to know. Scott Calvin finds himself responsible for resuming his duties. At the North Pole, the main elf Bernard tells Scott that according to the "Santa Clause" law, is now required by law to take on Santa's identity. After Charlie tells his mom and child-psychologist stepfather Neil (Judge Reinhold), they're convinced that Charlie has been warped by his dad. While the movie treat Neal who takes a doubtful position on Santa's reality not into a jerk like other holiday films nor does the ex-wife is a love interest. Months do pass and Scott transforms into Santa, until court hearings decide that he's nuts and cut off his visitation rights. Another December 24 approaches and Scott must convince his employers and ex that he's not crazy, and that he is Santa Claus. The premise for "The Santa Clause," written by Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick and directed by John Pasquin, is a clever one, and the movie is not without real charm. The Santa Clause launched Tim Allen in the movie business, spawned two sequels, and did so much for the holidays. It had great storyline with great characters. Aided by excellent special effects, he really does look like he's changing to St. Nick. The movie has the funny romp through the misadventures of an average man trying to cope with his unexpected transformation into Santa Claus. The jokes about him changing are just as funny for adults as for kids. The movie also has depth in the relationship of father and son who love each other during custody hearing. Still some people may be disappointed that this movie overlooks the religious significance of Christmas in favor of present-giving and childhood wish-fulfillment, but the movie ends on an appropriate note of good will and reconciliation. The child actor playing Charles (Eric Lloyd) is just annoying who whines his way unconvincingly throughout the film. Still Charles was able to explain some Santa Claus questions when judged by Neil. I like how the film tackles the Santa Claus questions to the myths by an intriguing theory, handled in a throwaway line of dialogue, to explain how Santa is able to do what he can do. One thing that needs to be mention is about the presents magically appears under the tree. It's one of the biggest plot holes; every parent turns a blind eye to the extra presents under the tree. In the film, Santa is real, but the adults don't believe he is real, how can they think he's not real exactly when toys just magically show up. Sadly this is my opinion, the first and only good Tim Allen movie role besides voicing Buzz Light year in Toy Story. He could have done better, as the sequels to this are not that great. It's a great watch, but probably only good watching it once in the holidays.

On Christmas Eve, Scott reads The Night Before Christmas... then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof.

But it hasn't aged well, like other classic Christmas movies and its due to the sarcastic tone and yuppie attitude Calvin has during the first act. This was boring in 1995, and watching it with my daughter seventeen years later, she was losing interest very fast. The film does redeem itself when we reach the north pole, but the adult humour and the childish tones do not bond well. It's a good film to watch one cold Christmas afternoon, Allen is a presence and the support is great. Just not brilliant enough to be a Christmas classic

Aided by excellent special effects, he really does look like he's changing to St. Nick. The movie has the funny romp through the misadventures of an average man trying to cope with his unexpected transformation into Santa Claus. The jokes about him changing are just as funny for adults as for kids. The movie also has depth in the relationship of father and son who love each other during custody hearing. Still some people may be disappointed that this movie overlooks the religious significance of Christmas in favor of present-giving and childhood wish-fulfillment, but the movie ends on an appropriate note of good will and reconciliation. The child actor playing Charles (Eric Lloyd) is just annoying who whines his way unconvincingly throughout the film. Still Charles was able to explain some Santa Claus questions when judged by Neil. I like how the film tackles the Santa Claus questions to the myths by an intriguing theory, handled in a throwaway line of dialogue, to explain how Santa is able to do what he can do. One thing that needs to be mention is about the presents magically appears under the tree. It's one of the biggest plot holes; every parent turns a blind eye to the extra presents under the tree. In the film, Santa is real, but the adults don't believe he is real, how can they think he's not real exactly when toys just magically show up. Sadly this is my opinion, the first and only good Tim Allen movie role besides voicing Buzz Light year in Toy Story. He could have done better, as the sequels to this are not that great. It's a great watch, but probably only good watching it once in the holidays.

    Scott Calvin is disgusted to learn that his ex and her husband have tried to break it to son Charlie that Santa isn't real. On Christmas Eve, Scott reads The Night Before Christmas... then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof. When he's startled by Scott's calling out and falls, Santa vanishes leaving only an 8-reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does, and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group who claim they're elves that he is now Santa. Charlie is proud of his dad's new job, though Scott's convinced it's a dream. Until his hair turns white, his beard refuses to stay shaved, he gains weight inexplicably, even for his sudden love of junk food..... Less of a Christmas movie and more of a starring role for Allen to make it big in Hollywood, the film mildly succeeds on both accounts, after all this is Allens second franchise with Disney, and the film profited enough to garner more sequels. But it hasn't aged well, like other classic Christmas movies and its due to the sarcastic tone and yuppie attitude Calvin has during the first act. This was boring in 1995, and watching it with my daughter seventeen years later, she was losing interest very fast. The film does redeem itself when we reach the north pole, but the adult humour and the childish tones do not bond well. It's a good film to watch one cold Christmas afternoon, Allen is a presence and the support is great. Just not brilliant enough to be a Christmas classic

    Having seen all 3 in the series, this is still the best one. But like a lot of Disney movies, ironically, someone (or an animal character) has to die in the story? Why couldn't Santa just have retired instead of slipping on the icy roof and "disappearing"? Well, it seems that this started out as a "Hollywood Films" Disney movie which was intended to be more like a "Christmas Vacation-style" film with adult humor and became "Disneyfied". Ultimately, this was a very good thing. (Originally, SC was to have shot Santa with a shotgun, as a rooftop burglar.) Scott Calvin becomes the Santa replacement because of the "Santa Clause": He who causes the current Santa to be unable to perform his duties must take his place; and he faces numerous comic dilemmas: Santa weight gain, bushy white facial hair, disbelief by all. The cleverly-written script carries the movie along and the airborne elves at the end are very ingenious. Santa Clause 2 (which Disney didn't run on cable this year) is a bit "off". It's too weird. The plastic duplicate Santa has a nightmarish "Frankenstein" quality to it. SC courting "Mrs. Claus" is the only saving-grace of Santa 2. Seeing SC's kid turn into a juvenile delinquent is a real downer. Comet the Reindeer is hilarious and steals the show. So candy bars make him fat, but why the "potty" humor? The "rip-off" ending from Laurel & Hardy's "March of the Wooden Soldiers" shows a great lack of originality here. It's been done before-in the 1930's. Santa Clause 3 is actually better than #2, but once again, it steals the plot from another film. This time, it steals the "Jack Frost" villain from an old Rankin-Bass animated short: "Frosty the Snowman." However, Martin Short is very good as Jack Frost and I personally like it better than Santa Clause 2. However, the out-takes over the ending credits spoil the "magic" of a Santa film. Enough already, please no more Santa Clause movies. (I can see it all now: Santa Clause 4: Scott Calvin's kid takes over the role after old SC has a heart attack from eating too many cookies and drinking too much hot chocolate. Judy the Elf takes over for the Mrs.--Good Grief!)

    Tim Allen, Judge Reinhold, Wendy Crewson, Eric Lloyd, David Krumholtz and Peter Boyle star in this 1994 comedy. Scott Calvin (Allen) is a divorced dad and toy exec who is getting ready to spend Christmas Eve with his son, Charlie (Lloyd). After Santa Claus falls off his roof, Scott takes the job of Santa and he and Charlie head off to the North Pole. When arriving, Scott is told by head elf, Bernard (Krumholtz) about the "Santa Clause," which means when he puts on the suit he becomes the big guy and accepts the responsibility. Scott eventually realizes that it's not a dream and he's really Santa. Crewson plays his ex-wife, Laura, Reinhold plays her psychiatrist husband, Neil Miller and Boyle plays Scott's boss. I think this is one of the best holiday films and Tim is great in it. I recommend this.

    This was the only Santa Clause I enjoyed out of the three that had came out. I believe that this one was the most entertaining of the three. I think the key aspect to a movie is the beginning, and the beginning and middle were the most entertaining to me in this movie. The end was good, but to me, it started getting a bit silly. I won't spoil anything, but after the mid-section of the movie was done, it wasn't so whimsical and amusing anymore. In the beginning and middle of the movie, it's all about Tim Allen not believing that he is Santa Clause, and I find that quite humorous because that's what any person would probably do. However, overall this movie does deserve a 7/10 and I definitely recommend watching it for families, because this is a 100% family approved film!

    Scott had to look after his son after his ex-wife and new husband drop him off. The night he stay over, he then accident scare Santa and he falls of the roof and he himself become Santa Claus. As his son on trip to north pole, next day where no believe the kids, was little sad that no one believe him as not that enjoyable to watch. also went to Over the top with the elves with attitude, I found a bit silly however you can say think about small elves that look kids but can be 300 years old?, those elves did not bother me. This well acted and well paced movie and some very hilarious moment in this movie and a nice ending as well. 7 out of 10

    This movie really captures the true spirit of Christmas. Tim Allen does a wonderful job in it, and I think he was perfect for this role, I can't imagine anyone else in it. One night during the Christmas season Santa falls off of a man's roof, and can't continue his duties, Tim Allen's character is now bestowed the duty of becoming the new Santa Claus, at first he doesn't want to do it, presumably because of all the responsibility that comes with it. but as we go on , he gradually get's used to the idea, he has a little boy that he loves very much and maybe things could be really good now that he's Santa, one problem tho the boy tells his mother that dad is Santa, and the mother doesn't believe him and things don't' go well in the beginning,, I will leave it at that,, but I just wanna say that this is a movie for all ages, and captures the true spirit of the season.

    Ever since I was a child, I always had a fascination with Christmas. The trees, the snow, and the lights -- to me it was an escape from the harshness of reality. And yes - I guess my views on this film can be viewed as biased. (God - I wish they would make more movies like this. Just the magic of it, I do not see it anymore in Christmas films.) When I first sat down to watch this film, I got instantaneously sucked into it. It's just a great film from the moment it starts to the very end (I wish the other 2 sequels were as great but unfortunately, they are huge letdowns.) I really can't imagine this film with anybody but Tim Allen. And when I read that Disney did not allow anybody to work in their films with a criminal record; I was really glad that they decided to make an exception to their policy. Unlike Scott who first put on the Santa suit (upon accidentally killing Santa Clause) and regretted it - you won't regret putting this film on play.

    This is a delightful Christmas movie which my wife and I savoured on Christmas Eve, not having watched it before (and how many Christmas films can you say that about)? Like all the best Yuletide films, it requires the viewer to take a leap of faith and believe the unbelievable so that once you do that you're taken along for the ride and in this case, an entertaining and amusing ride it certainly is. Tim Allen stars as the divorced dad who feels diminished next to his ex-wife and her new man, who naturally is younger, better-looking and higher-earning, though with a taste for gaudily patterned pullovers. Even his relationship with his young son is beginning to pall, despite his best, if misguided efforts but when his rival, a myth-defying, dream-denying psychiatrist attempts to brainwash young Charlie that Santa doesn't exist, it's obvious that it's going to take something exceptional for him to turn the situation around. Cue a fateful encounter with an unexpected visitor on the roof on Christmas Eve and the fun really starts. While some of the special-effects are a little weak, in general this movie gently and neatly encapsulates the elusive Christmas spirit with a nicely judged mix of childish wonder and knowing humour for grown-ups,making it an easy film for parents and children to watch together. Neat touches abound, with pointy-eared elves turning up everywhere, running gags inserted into the narrative and some pleasing sight gags (I liked especially the cops map of the area surrounding Allen's house as they set up the Santa sting, a do-nut shop prominently highlighted for easy reference). Allen makes for a believable, under-achieving dad who eventually accepts his transformation and so wins back his son's affection. The child actor playing his son too I found refreshingly cute-free. Interestingly, the story has no real baddie to pitch them up against, unless you're going to vilify Judge Reinhold for denying Santa's existence. Watching this pleasant and amusing film certainly set our household up for this coming Christmas in what I certainly rate as one of the superior Christmas-themed films.

    Yes, Santa Claus does die in Santa Clause. It is need for the plot of Scott Calvin (Tim Allen). Scott Calvin is spending some time with his son Charlie on Christmas Eve when he hears something on the roof. It turns out to be Santa Claus whom Allen's character accidentally kills by yelling at him. Santa Claus lost his footing and fell off the roof to his death. Surprising, the movie is very okay with showing death so heartily. There is something wrong with that. There was no mention of whom the guy was, or anything. He's dead, and that's all we needed to know. Scott Calvin finds himself responsible for resuming his duties. At the North Pole, the main elf Bernard tells Scott that according to the "Santa Clause" law, is now required by law to take on Santa's identity. After Charlie tells his mom and child-psychologist stepfather Neil (Judge Reinhold), they're convinced that Charlie has been warped by his dad. While the movie treat Neal who takes a doubtful position on Santa's reality not into a jerk like other holiday films nor does the ex-wife is a love interest. Months do pass and Scott transforms into Santa, until court hearings decide that he's nuts and cut off his visitation rights. Another December 24 approaches and Scott must convince his employers and ex that he's not crazy, and that he is Santa Claus. The premise for "The Santa Clause," written by Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick and directed by John Pasquin, is a clever one, and the movie is not without real charm. The Santa Clause launched Tim Allen in the movie business, spawned two sequels, and did so much for the holidays. It had great storyline with great characters. Aided by excellent special effects, he really does look like he's changing to St. Nick. The movie has the funny romp through the misadventures of an average man trying to cope with his unexpected transformation into Santa Claus. The jokes about him changing are just as funny for adults as for kids. The movie also has depth in the relationship of father and son who love each other during custody hearing. Still some people may be disappointed that this movie overlooks the religious significance of Christmas in favor of present-giving and childhood wish-fulfillment, but the movie ends on an appropriate note of good will and reconciliation. The child actor playing Charles (Eric Lloyd) is just annoying who whines his way unconvincingly throughout the film. Still Charles was able to explain some Santa Claus questions when judged by Neil. I like how the film tackles the Santa Claus questions to the myths by an intriguing theory, handled in a throwaway line of dialogue, to explain how Santa is able to do what he can do. One thing that needs to be mention is about the presents magically appears under the tree. It's one of the biggest plot holes; every parent turns a blind eye to the extra presents under the tree. In the film, Santa is real, but the adults don't believe he is real, how can they think he's not real exactly when toys just magically show up. Sadly this is my opinion, the first and only good Tim Allen movie role besides voicing Buzz Light year in Toy Story. He could have done better, as the sequels to this are not that great. It's a great watch, but probably only good watching it once in the holidays.

Interestingly, the story has no real baddie to pitch them up against, unless you're going to vilify Judge Reinhold for denying Santa's existence. Watching this pleasant and amusing film certainly set our household up for this coming Christmas in what I certainly rate as one of the superior Christmas-themed films.

    Yes, Santa Claus does die in Santa Clause. It is need for the plot of Scott Calvin (Tim Allen). Scott Calvin is spending some time with his son Charlie on Christmas Eve when he hears something on the roof. It turns out to be Santa Claus whom Allen's character accidentally kills by yelling at him. Santa Claus lost his footing and fell off the roof to his death. Surprising, the movie is very okay with showing death so heartily. There is something wrong with that. There was no mention of whom the guy was, or anything. He's dead, and that's all we needed to know. Scott Calvin finds himself responsible for resuming his duties. At the North Pole, the main elf Bernard tells Scott that according to the "Santa Clause" law, is now required by law to take on Santa's identity. After Charlie tells his mom and child-psychologist stepfather Neil (Judge Reinhold), they're convinced that Charlie has been warped by his dad. While the movie treat Neal who takes a doubtful position on Santa's reality not into a jerk like other holiday films nor does the ex-wife is a love interest. Months do pass and Scott transforms into Santa, until court hearings decide that he's nuts and cut off his visitation rights. Another December 24 approaches and Scott must convince his employers and ex that he's not crazy, and that he is Santa Claus. The premise for "The Santa Clause," written by Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick and directed by John Pasquin, is a clever one, and the movie is not without real charm. The Santa Clause launched Tim Allen in the movie business, spawned two sequels, and did so much for the holidays. It had great storyline with great characters. Aided by excellent special effects, he really does look like he's changing to St. Nick. The movie has the funny romp through the misadventures of an average man trying to cope with his unexpected transformation into Santa Claus. The jokes about him changing are just as funny for adults as for kids. The movie also has depth in the relationship of father and son who love each other during custody hearing. Still some people may be disappointed that this movie overlooks the religious significance of Christmas in favor of present-giving and childhood wish-fulfillment, but the movie ends on an appropriate note of good will and reconciliation. The child actor playing Charles (Eric Lloyd) is just annoying who whines his way unconvincingly throughout the film. Still Charles was able to explain some Santa Claus questions when judged by Neil. I like how the film tackles the Santa Claus questions to the myths by an intriguing theory, handled in a throwaway line of dialogue, to explain how Santa is able to do what he can do. One thing that needs to be mention is about the presents magically appears under the tree. It's one of the biggest plot holes; every parent turns a blind eye to the extra presents under the tree. In the film, Santa is real, but the adults don't believe he is real, how can they think he's not real exactly when toys just magically show up. Sadly this is my opinion, the first and only good Tim Allen movie role besides voicing Buzz Light year in Toy Story. He could have done better, as the sequels to this are not that great. It's a great watch, but probably only good watching it once in the holidays.

    Scott Calvin is disgusted to learn that his ex and her husband have tried to break it to son Charlie that Santa isn't real. On Christmas Eve, Scott reads The Night Before Christmas... then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof. When he's startled by Scott's calling out and falls, Santa vanishes leaving only an 8-reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does, and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group who claim they're elves that he is now Santa. Charlie is proud of his dad's new job, though Scott's convinced it's a dream. Until his hair turns white, his beard refuses to stay shaved, he gains weight inexplicably, even for his sudden love of junk food..... Less of a Christmas movie and more of a starring role for Allen to make it big in Hollywood, the film mildly succeeds on both accounts, after all this is Allens second franchise with Disney, and the film profited enough to garner more sequels. But it hasn't aged well, like other classic Christmas movies and its due to the sarcastic tone and yuppie attitude Calvin has during the first act. This was boring in 1995, and watching it with my daughter seventeen years later, she was losing interest very fast. The film does redeem itself when we reach the north pole, but the adult humour and the childish tones do not bond well. It's a good film to watch one cold Christmas afternoon, Allen is a presence and the support is great. Just not brilliant enough to be a Christmas classic

    Having seen all 3 in the series, this is still the best one. But like a lot of Disney movies, ironically, someone (or an animal character) has to die in the story? Why couldn't Santa just have retired instead of slipping on the icy roof and "disappearing"? Well, it seems that this started out as a "Hollywood Films" Disney movie which was intended to be more like a "Christmas Vacation-style" film with adult humor and became "Disneyfied". Ultimately, this was a very good thing. (Originally, SC was to have shot Santa with a shotgun, as a rooftop burglar.) Scott Calvin becomes the Santa replacement because of the "Santa Clause": He who causes the current Santa to be unable to perform his duties must take his place; and he faces numerous comic dilemmas: Santa weight gain, bushy white facial hair, disbelief by all. The cleverly-written script carries the movie along and the airborne elves at the end are very ingenious. Santa Clause 2 (which Disney didn't run on cable this year) is a bit "off". It's too weird. The plastic duplicate Santa has a nightmarish "Frankenstein" quality to it. SC courting "Mrs. Claus" is the only saving-grace of Santa 2. Seeing SC's kid turn into a juvenile delinquent is a real downer. Comet the Reindeer is hilarious and steals the show. So candy bars make him fat, but why the "potty" humor? The "rip-off" ending from Laurel & Hardy's "March of the Wooden Soldiers" shows a great lack of originality here. It's been done before-in the 1930's. Santa Clause 3 is actually better than #2, but once again, it steals the plot from another film. This time, it steals the "Jack Frost" villain from an old Rankin-Bass animated short: "Frosty the Snowman." However, Martin Short is very good as Jack Frost and I personally like it better than Santa Clause 2. However, the out-takes over the ending credits spoil the "magic" of a Santa film. Enough already, please no more Santa Clause movies. (I can see it all now: Santa Clause 4: Scott Calvin's kid takes over the role after old SC has a heart attack from eating too many cookies and drinking too much hot chocolate. Judy the Elf takes over for the Mrs.--Good Grief!)

    Tim Allen, Judge Reinhold, Wendy Crewson, Eric Lloyd, David Krumholtz and Peter Boyle star in this 1994 comedy. Scott Calvin (Allen) is a divorced dad and toy exec who is getting ready to spend Christmas Eve with his son, Charlie (Lloyd). After Santa Claus falls off his roof, Scott takes the job of Santa and he and Charlie head off to the North Pole. When arriving, Scott is told by head elf, Bernard (Krumholtz) about the "Santa Clause," which means when he puts on the suit he becomes the big guy and accepts the responsibility. Scott eventually realizes that it's not a dream and he's really Santa. Crewson plays his ex-wife, Laura, Reinhold plays her psychiatrist husband, Neil Miller and Boyle plays Scott's boss. I think this is one of the best holiday films and Tim is great in it. I recommend this.

    This was the only Santa Clause I enjoyed out of the three that had came out. I believe that this one was the most entertaining of the three. I think the key aspect to a movie is the beginning, and the beginning and middle were the most entertaining to me in this movie. The end was good, but to me, it started getting a bit silly. I won't spoil anything, but after the mid-section of the movie was done, it wasn't so whimsical and amusing anymore. In the beginning and middle of the movie, it's all about Tim Allen not believing that he is Santa Clause, and I find that quite humorous because that's what any person would probably do. However, overall this movie does deserve a 7/10 and I definitely recommend watching it for families, because this is a 100% family approved film!

    Watching this film,we may have a different attitude on the most important part of holidays;Scott Calvin (Allen), is a divorced father trying to share Christmas with his son Charlie(Eric Loyd).The moment of reality arises,when an unfortunate accident makes doubting Scott a new Santa. Through the film,Scott changes and grows more like the Santa image we all perceive to be real.As the medical community holds true to facts,Dr. Miller (Reinhold) is a noted psychiatrist.He feels the need to guide his stepson towards an honest path. The elves guide the new Santa, in following scheduled time.Towards the end,we see Charlie and his family become adamant believers in "Jolly Old Saint Nick".I love this film, and am tickled pink at the joy and love it embodies.

    Scott had to look after his son after his ex-wife and new husband drop him off. The night he stay over, he then accident scare Santa and he falls of the roof and he himself become Santa Claus. As his son on trip to north pole, next day where no believe the kids, was little sad that no one believe him as not that enjoyable to watch. also went to Over the top with the elves with attitude, I found a bit silly however you can say think about small elves that look kids but can be 300 years old?, those elves did not bother me. This well acted and well paced movie and some very hilarious moment in this movie and a nice ending as well. 7 out of 10
