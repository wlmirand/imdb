    This French-Japanese film, also known as Ai No Corrida, I knew was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but then I found out that it featured real sexual intercourse, oral and various other intimate acts, so I had to see if a good story fit with it as well. Basically in 1936, Tokyo, former prostitute Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) works now as a maid in a hotel, and she is molested by the owner of the hotel Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji), but she is not offended by it and the two of them begin an intense affair. They make love passionately with all kinds of sexual experimentation, drinking and other various forms of self-indulgence, and they do not seem to be bothered with people walking in on them, and to pursue his affair with her Ishida leaves his wife and family. As time passes Abe for some reason becomes jealous of Ishida, probably in terms of receiving pleasure, and she also becomes very possessive, but all he ever wants to do is make her happy, whether it means more intense experimental sex. They become so obsessed with their escalating attempts to achieve the ultimate love making experience and orgasm that he allows her to engage in sadomasochism, this mostly involves her strangling during lovemaking. Eventually it comes to the point when Ishida is killed by Abe strangling him to death, but she is not completely phased by his death, in fact she goes as far to cut off his penis and testicles, and with his blood write the words "Sada Kichi the two of us forever" on his chest. Being based on a true event the real woman was arrested for the crime of murder, but in fact many people who heard about the story were empathetic towards her because of the passionate love she had for the man. Also starring Aoi Nakajima as Toku, Meika Seri as Maid Matsuko and Taiji Tonoyama as Old Beggar. I will be honest and say first that I was most intrigued to see real lovemaking on screen, and it is not something I have seen often in a foreign film regarded by critics, but then I remembered seeing a clip of the controversial ending on a programme, very hard to watch, it is a very interesting insight into how extreme passion can sometimes go too far, a most watchable erotic drama based on a true story. It was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    This was disturbing to watch. First of all, one needs to buy into its cultural me milieu. Then we need to begin to accept the two fundamental characters and how they meld into that setting. This is a story of unbridled sensualism. It's soft one moment and hideous the next. The movie is incredibly graphic and I'm sure the release frightened and confused its patrons. I have to admit, I never really fell under its spell. As a matter of fact, I think I felt that I was invading a sick kind of world. Was I seeing people or monsters? There is great effort at times to prevent it from moving into the next level. The performances aren't really sexual as much as sadistic. This is proved out.

    I found myself confused about what the film maker was trying to convey. It is true that there are graphic sex scenes that caused me to press the forward button. I felt the movie was about a woman's toxic obsession and the man's willing to do whatever it took to fulfill her insatiable desires. I must say that the director and actors were daring to be willing to take part telling this true story, which I Googled after watching the movie. I would say to watch the movie for yourself and decide what you think. I found it interesting that the story seemed to be told without judgment of the characters. It was just a frank narrative of a tragic story of a twisted love affair. This movie is not for the faint at heart.

    A former prostitute, Sada, starts working as a maid at a hotel and is assaulted by the owner, Kichizo, and the two soon begin a torrid affair with many sado masochistic aspects to the relationship. Kichizo leaves his wife and family to please his demanding lover. He becomes obsessively jealous of his insatiable soul mate. The lovemaking becomes more and more violent until Kichizo requests that Sada strangle him while they are engaged in the act. In the realm of the senses is an extremely graphic film for a main stream movie, so if you are offended by explicit sex and gory violence, stay away from this and rent a Disney feature instead.

    For better or for worse, there aren't a lot of movies out there like In the Realm of the Senses. Well, there's porn, but this isn't really porn -- it lets the ugliness as well as the beauty of sex shine through, and through all the cinematographic haze it seems considerably more real than depictions of sex in even "regular" movies. There's a narrative here, told through the slowly-unfolding patterns of debauchery, one of a terrifying spiral of hedonism. In the end, despite all of its explicitness, it's more of a conservative cautionary tale than anything else. What makes In The Realm of the Senses work as well as it does is the beautiful images and almost mystical pacing of director Oshima. I won't lie and say that there aren't times when the film is tedious and even dull, or that its final conclusion is extremely profound. But it's one hell of an experience, and a disgusting gonzo film that needed to be made. It's one of those films that you don't watch, you live through.

    In the realm of senses is quite simply a movie like no other. There are simply no words to describe what the movie was like. Without giving away the details, I can say that this movie is about a very obsessive sexual relationship between a man and his servant. So obsessive that they actually don't give a darn about anything that happens. Where their obsession takes them in the end is basically the story of the film. Although the premise seems rather off-beat, the story was handled very well by the director Nagisa Oshima and the actors did a very good job. The art was good and the music was effective enough. The deeper you go into the movie, the deeper the characters go into their sexual unhealthy obsession and the more concerned you become about their fate. This movie is, in NO WAY, a PORNO. You can call it naked art if you want. And yes, the sex was not dry. But who would watch an entire 100 minutes of a movie like this by only focusing on the story? The sex scenes were pretty explicit and real(as in UN-simulated). Still, all of them had their part in the story-telling. Also, one very important point to be considered while trying to interpret this film, if one would want to, is that the story is completely character-driven. Looking at the movie in this perspective helps in a better viewing. The movie goes beyond it's NC-17 rating, but more importantly, the movie goes beyond the day-to-day reality and shows something that is so shocking, so disturbing and so depressing that in the end, you will be left utterly speechless. It is indeed, beyond the realm of senses, showing how related yet far-away, love and sex are. I watched this movie three days ago and it still hasn't left me, quite literally. If not for anything else, watch it for the guts it shows in handling such a daring taboo-breaking subject very well and being very artistic without becoming sleazy and filthy for even one moment. A horribly under-rated masterpiece which only demands an open mind from the user to perform in its fullest. A truly UN-forgettable experience.

    "In the Realm of the Senses" aroused MUCH controversy in 70's and it's a kind of movie which only could be made in that decade. Even a lot of controversial flicks in 70's(like last tango in Paris) could be easily rated PG in comparison with this one! "Love & Cascrate" as the motif , is explicitly illustrated in the most shocking scenes & it's difficult to watch for a general viewer. honestly i never understood what is it all about, but tough buffs of this movie(& they are many) believe in Oshmia's perfect use of mise en scene in describing a mentally-disturbed female character. no wonder that it's the most favorite movie of Catherine Breillat.( top ten choosing in Sight n Sound 2002)

    An adulterer's favorite partner's obsessions continually worsen, unchecked. The extreme results of this true story inspired the making of 'In the Realm of the Senses'. Not everyone will appreciate the straightforward telling of this story. You must be okay with viewing graphic nudity, explicit sex acts and consensual violence. Most countries limit viewing to adults. Some have outlawed it entirely. No English audio exists  just subtitles. Pros include: 1. The uncensored escalation of risks accepted by an over-trusting man. 2. Contextual foundations leading to each scene. This is not director-fantasy pornography. 3. Good acting, cinematography and flow of events. Cons include: 1. The storyline is too narrow. Although sex was exclusively what led to the events, such focus belongs in a documentary format rather than in a traditional movie. 2. Way too visual for today's free audiences. For most people, it likely evokes either abhorrence or sexual arousal, leaving less of the viewer's attention on the story itself (for those who care). OVERALL 6/10: 'In the Realm of the Senses' is A FAIR MOVIE FOR WATCHING ALONE or with like-minded people either a) as porn; or b) for analytical comparisons with crime or religion or psychology. As general entertainment, though, it is of VERY LOW VALUE.

    Nagisa "Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence" Oshima's most notorious film culminates with a truly shocking ending, encapsulating the sheer force of self-destructive passion between Kichi (Tatsuya Fuji) and Sada (Eiko Matsuda). It's an apt, inevitable climax. The film sees a master, Kichi, take a servant, Sada, as his concubine. The balance of power quickly shifts, however, as Kichi struggles to come to terms with Sada's insatiable, and increasingly dangerous, sensual appetite. Together they push away a prudish world that would label them perverts; with the help of a carefully inserted boiled egg, they even mock the institution of procreation. Though notions of class are touched upon (Sada, drawn from prostitution and servitude, refers to her desire to be "respectable" when with Kichi as well as a particularly paternal client), really this is a film about sex and death. You certainly can't fault it for scope of ambition, and yet its narrow - nay blinkered - focus on its deliriously conflicted protagonists is perhaps its greatest strength. After the opening scenes, Kichi and Sada dominate every last coital frame. I've found the film becomes sadder, more poignant, with repeated viewings. The addiction is palpable, the self-annihilation agonising - not only in the characters' actions but in their changing faces: the terrible anxiety that what they share is transient; the haunting knowledge that death at the zenith is preferable to a slow decline. I'll paddle into the art versus porn debate by saying that those looking for titillation from this film will probably find it - but they will also find a heartfelt, insightful and ultimately devastating portrait of extreme human desire.

    Perverted eroticism or work of art? This will be a long debate. To be honest I saw this film after seeing The Gray man (2007), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), and Albert Fish: In Sin He found Salvation (2007), Dahmer (2002), The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), To Catch a Killer (TV 1992). The above films I have mentioned all contain a theme: sex oriented killings due to an unfulfilled sexual fantasy. This film proves what sex beyond the limits can lead to. Sex should be done lovingly, with romance and understanding between the couple. Both should be deeply in love with one another and be satisfied with that. A wife is NOT A PROSTITUTE, she is YOUR COMPANION FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You are her shield and protector and to think of another woman is committing a grave sin. Sex with another woman while you are married to a faithful wife is adultery and you are only cheating yourself. If your wife fails to take an interest in sex, there are sex therapists available and counseling as well. You could even go on a vacation and re-ignite your love life. Also you could try out new sex positions you have never explored. There are DVD's which teach advanced lovemaking techniques. THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. This is the most HORRIFYING aspect of the film. THAT IT REALLY OCCURRED AS PORTRAYED IN THE FILM. Plot: Kichizo Ishida a married man falls in love with a woman called Sada Abe. Ishida is unsatisfied with his own wife due to his abnormally high libido. Sada Aba appears to be what we now call a nymphomaniac who cannot be satisfied by a normal man. This chance meeting leads to an explosion of unrestricted sex between the two which goes out of control towards the climax of the film, where Sada strangles and kills Ishida (only after he gives her his full consent to do it). Later she severs his penis. Director Noboru Tanaka's film: A Woman Called Sada Abe is another more sexually oriented film of the same story. Many critics have written that the film is also an exploration of how eroticism in Japanese culture is often morbid or death-obsessed. The film's director Nagisa &Ocirc;shima was also criticized for using explicit sex to draw attention to the film, but the director has stated that the explicitness is an integral part of the movie's design. Controversy: Strict censorship laws would not have allowed the film to be completed as per Oshima's vision in Japan. To get around this, the production was officially listed as a French enterprise, and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for processing and editing. At its premi&egrave;re in Japan, the sexual activity was optically censored. In the US, the film was initially banned upon its premi&egrave;re at the 1976 New York Film Festival, but later screened uncut; a similar fate awaited the film when it was released in Germany. The film was not available on home video until 1990. The British Board of Film Censors, at the time of its first limited screenings in the UK, recommended it be shown under private 'cinema club' conditions to avoid the need for cuts to be made, but only after the Obscene Publications Act had been extended to films (in 1977) to avoid potential legal problems. More recently the BBFC has granted the film an "18" certificate (suitable for adults only), leaving all of the adult sexual activity intact, but ordered that a shot showing a prepubescent boy having his penis pulled as punishment be optically reframed so that the act itself was not shown.The film has been made available, however, in completely uncut form in France, the United States (including the current The Criterion Collection DVD), the Netherlands, and several other territories. In Canada, when originally submitted to the provincial film boards in the 1970s, the film was rejected in all jurisdictions except Quebec. It was not until 1991 that individual provinces approved the film and gave it a certificate. However, in the Maritimes the film was rejected again as the policies followed in the 1970s were still enforced. You can watch Noboru Tanaka's film after this one. Also L'amant (1992) a.k.a. The Lover is another good film to see. Basic Instinct (1992) is another film that immediately springs to mind, as well as Fatal Attraction (1987). If you are a film lover and want recommendations.

For most people, it likely evokes either abhorrence or sexual arousal, leaving less of the viewer's attention on the story itself (for those who care). OVERALL 6/10: 'In the Realm of the Senses' is A FAIR MOVIE FOR WATCHING ALONE or with like-minded people either a) as porn; or b) for analytical comparisons with crime or religion or psychology. As general entertainment, though, it is of VERY LOW VALUE.

    Nagisa "Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence" Oshima's most notorious film culminates with a truly shocking ending, encapsulating the sheer force of self-destructive passion between Kichi (Tatsuya Fuji) and Sada (Eiko Matsuda). It's an apt, inevitable climax. The film sees a master, Kichi, take a servant, Sada, as his concubine. The balance of power quickly shifts, however, as Kichi struggles to come to terms with Sada's insatiable, and increasingly dangerous, sensual appetite. Together they push away a prudish world that would label them perverts; with the help of a carefully inserted boiled egg, they even mock the institution of procreation. Though notions of class are touched upon (Sada, drawn from prostitution and servitude, refers to her desire to be "respectable" when with Kichi as well as a particularly paternal client), really this is a film about sex and death. You certainly can't fault it for scope of ambition, and yet its narrow - nay blinkered - focus on its deliriously conflicted protagonists is perhaps its greatest strength. After the opening scenes, Kichi and Sada dominate every last coital frame. I've found the film becomes sadder, more poignant, with repeated viewings. The addiction is palpable, the self-annihilation agonising - not only in the characters' actions but in their changing faces: the terrible anxiety that what they share is transient; the haunting knowledge that death at the zenith is preferable to a slow decline. I'll paddle into the art versus porn debate by saying that those looking for titillation from this film will probably find it - but they will also find a heartfelt, insightful and ultimately devastating portrait of extreme human desire.

    Perverted eroticism or work of art? This will be a long debate. To be honest I saw this film after seeing The Gray man (2007), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), and Albert Fish: In Sin He found Salvation (2007), Dahmer (2002), The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), To Catch a Killer (TV 1992). The above films I have mentioned all contain a theme: sex oriented killings due to an unfulfilled sexual fantasy. This film proves what sex beyond the limits can lead to. Sex should be done lovingly, with romance and understanding between the couple. Both should be deeply in love with one another and be satisfied with that. A wife is NOT A PROSTITUTE, she is YOUR COMPANION FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You are her shield and protector and to think of another woman is committing a grave sin. Sex with another woman while you are married to a faithful wife is adultery and you are only cheating yourself. If your wife fails to take an interest in sex, there are sex therapists available and counseling as well. You could even go on a vacation and re-ignite your love life. Also you could try out new sex positions you have never explored. There are DVD's which teach advanced lovemaking techniques. THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. This is the most HORRIFYING aspect of the film. THAT IT REALLY OCCURRED AS PORTRAYED IN THE FILM. Plot: Kichizo Ishida a married man falls in love with a woman called Sada Abe. Ishida is unsatisfied with his own wife due to his abnormally high libido. Sada Aba appears to be what we now call a nymphomaniac who cannot be satisfied by a normal man. This chance meeting leads to an explosion of unrestricted sex between the two which goes out of control towards the climax of the film, where Sada strangles and kills Ishida (only after he gives her his full consent to do it). Later she severs his penis. Director Noboru Tanaka's film: A Woman Called Sada Abe is another more sexually oriented film of the same story. Many critics have written that the film is also an exploration of how eroticism in Japanese culture is often morbid or death-obsessed. The film's director Nagisa &Ocirc;shima was also criticized for using explicit sex to draw attention to the film, but the director has stated that the explicitness is an integral part of the movie's design. Controversy: Strict censorship laws would not have allowed the film to be completed as per Oshima's vision in Japan. To get around this, the production was officially listed as a French enterprise, and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for processing and editing. At its premi&egrave;re in Japan, the sexual activity was optically censored. In the US, the film was initially banned upon its premi&egrave;re at the 1976 New York Film Festival, but later screened uncut; a similar fate awaited the film when it was released in Germany. The film was not available on home video until 1990. The British Board of Film Censors, at the time of its first limited screenings in the UK, recommended it be shown under private 'cinema club' conditions to avoid the need for cuts to be made, but only after the Obscene Publications Act had been extended to films (in 1977) to avoid potential legal problems. More recently the BBFC has granted the film an "18" certificate (suitable for adults only), leaving all of the adult sexual activity intact, but ordered that a shot showing a prepubescent boy having his penis pulled as punishment be optically reframed so that the act itself was not shown.The film has been made available, however, in completely uncut form in France, the United States (including the current The Criterion Collection DVD), the Netherlands, and several other territories. In Canada, when originally submitted to the provincial film boards in the 1970s, the film was rejected in all jurisdictions except Quebec. It was not until 1991 that individual provinces approved the film and gave it a certificate. However, in the Maritimes the film was rejected again as the policies followed in the 1970s were still enforced. You can watch Noboru Tanaka's film after this one. Also L'amant (1992) a.k.a. The Lover is another good film to see. Basic Instinct (1992) is another film that immediately springs to mind, as well as Fatal Attraction (1987). If you are a film lover and want recommendations.

    This French-Japanese film, also known as Ai No Corrida, I knew was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but then I found out that it featured real sexual intercourse, oral and various other intimate acts, so I had to see if a good story fit with it as well. Basically in 1936, Tokyo, former prostitute Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) works now as a maid in a hotel, and she is molested by the owner of the hotel Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji), but she is not offended by it and the two of them begin an intense affair. They make love passionately with all kinds of sexual experimentation, drinking and other various forms of self-indulgence, and they do not seem to be bothered with people walking in on them, and to pursue his affair with her Ishida leaves his wife and family. As time passes Abe for some reason becomes jealous of Ishida, probably in terms of receiving pleasure, and she also becomes very possessive, but all he ever wants to do is make her happy, whether it means more intense experimental sex. They become so obsessed with their escalating attempts to achieve the ultimate love making experience and orgasm that he allows her to engage in sadomasochism, this mostly involves her strangling during lovemaking. Eventually it comes to the point when Ishida is killed by Abe strangling him to death, but she is not completely phased by his death, in fact she goes as far to cut off his penis and testicles, and with his blood write the words "Sada Kichi the two of us forever" on his chest. Being based on a true event the real woman was arrested for the crime of murder, but in fact many people who heard about the story were empathetic towards her because of the passionate love she had for the man. Also starring Aoi Nakajima as Toku, Meika Seri as Maid Matsuko and Taiji Tonoyama as Old Beggar. I will be honest and say first that I was most intrigued to see real lovemaking on screen, and it is not something I have seen often in a foreign film regarded by critics, but then I remembered seeing a clip of the controversial ending on a programme, very hard to watch, it is a very interesting insight into how extreme passion can sometimes go too far, a most watchable erotic drama based on a true story. It was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    This was disturbing to watch. First of all, one needs to buy into its cultural me milieu. Then we need to begin to accept the two fundamental characters and how they meld into that setting. This is a story of unbridled sensualism. It's soft one moment and hideous the next. The movie is incredibly graphic and I'm sure the release frightened and confused its patrons. I have to admit, I never really fell under its spell. As a matter of fact, I think I felt that I was invading a sick kind of world. Was I seeing people or monsters? There is great effort at times to prevent it from moving into the next level. The performances aren't really sexual as much as sadistic. This is proved out.

    I found myself confused about what the film maker was trying to convey. It is true that there are graphic sex scenes that caused me to press the forward button. I felt the movie was about a woman's toxic obsession and the man's willing to do whatever it took to fulfill her insatiable desires. I must say that the director and actors were daring to be willing to take part telling this true story, which I Googled after watching the movie. I would say to watch the movie for yourself and decide what you think. I found it interesting that the story seemed to be told without judgment of the characters. It was just a frank narrative of a tragic story of a twisted love affair. This movie is not for the faint at heart.

    A former prostitute, Sada, starts working as a maid at a hotel and is assaulted by the owner, Kichizo, and the two soon begin a torrid affair with many sado masochistic aspects to the relationship. Kichizo leaves his wife and family to please his demanding lover. He becomes obsessively jealous of his insatiable soul mate. The lovemaking becomes more and more violent until Kichizo requests that Sada strangle him while they are engaged in the act. In the realm of the senses is an extremely graphic film for a main stream movie, so if you are offended by explicit sex and gory violence, stay away from this and rent a Disney feature instead.

    For better or for worse, there aren't a lot of movies out there like In the Realm of the Senses. Well, there's porn, but this isn't really porn -- it lets the ugliness as well as the beauty of sex shine through, and through all the cinematographic haze it seems considerably more real than depictions of sex in even "regular" movies. There's a narrative here, told through the slowly-unfolding patterns of debauchery, one of a terrifying spiral of hedonism. In the end, despite all of its explicitness, it's more of a conservative cautionary tale than anything else. What makes In The Realm of the Senses work as well as it does is the beautiful images and almost mystical pacing of director Oshima. I won't lie and say that there aren't times when the film is tedious and even dull, or that its final conclusion is extremely profound. But it's one hell of an experience, and a disgusting gonzo film that needed to be made. It's one of those films that you don't watch, you live through.

    In the realm of senses is quite simply a movie like no other. There are simply no words to describe what the movie was like. Without giving away the details, I can say that this movie is about a very obsessive sexual relationship between a man and his servant. So obsessive that they actually don't give a darn about anything that happens. Where their obsession takes them in the end is basically the story of the film. Although the premise seems rather off-beat, the story was handled very well by the director Nagisa Oshima and the actors did a very good job. The art was good and the music was effective enough. The deeper you go into the movie, the deeper the characters go into their sexual unhealthy obsession and the more concerned you become about their fate. This movie is, in NO WAY, a PORNO. You can call it naked art if you want. And yes, the sex was not dry. But who would watch an entire 100 minutes of a movie like this by only focusing on the story? The sex scenes were pretty explicit and real(as in UN-simulated). Still, all of them had their part in the story-telling. Also, one very important point to be considered while trying to interpret this film, if one would want to, is that the story is completely character-driven. Looking at the movie in this perspective helps in a better viewing. The movie goes beyond it's NC-17 rating, but more importantly, the movie goes beyond the day-to-day reality and shows something that is so shocking, so disturbing and so depressing that in the end, you will be left utterly speechless. It is indeed, beyond the realm of senses, showing how related yet far-away, love and sex are. I watched this movie three days ago and it still hasn't left me, quite literally. If not for anything else, watch it for the guts it shows in handling such a daring taboo-breaking subject very well and being very artistic without becoming sleazy and filthy for even one moment. A horribly under-rated masterpiece which only demands an open mind from the user to perform in its fullest. A truly UN-forgettable experience.

    "In the Realm of the Senses" aroused MUCH controversy in 70's and it's a kind of movie which only could be made in that decade. Even a lot of controversial flicks in 70's(like last tango in Paris) could be easily rated PG in comparison with this one! "Love & Cascrate" as the motif , is explicitly illustrated in the most shocking scenes & it's difficult to watch for a general viewer. honestly i never understood what is it all about, but tough buffs of this movie(& they are many) believe in Oshmia's perfect use of mise en scene in describing a mentally-disturbed female character. no wonder that it's the most favorite movie of Catherine Breillat.( top ten choosing in Sight n Sound 2002)

    An adulterer's favorite partner's obsessions continually worsen, unchecked. The extreme results of this true story inspired the making of 'In the Realm of the Senses'. Not everyone will appreciate the straightforward telling of this story. You must be okay with viewing graphic nudity, explicit sex acts and consensual violence. Most countries limit viewing to adults. Some have outlawed it entirely. No English audio exists  just subtitles. Pros include: 1. The uncensored escalation of risks accepted by an over-trusting man. 2. Contextual foundations leading to each scene. This is not director-fantasy pornography. 3. Good acting, cinematography and flow of events. Cons include: 1. The storyline is too narrow. Although sex was exclusively what led to the events, such focus belongs in a documentary format rather than in a traditional movie. 2. Way too visual for today's free audiences. For most people, it likely evokes either abhorrence or sexual arousal, leaving less of the viewer's attention on the story itself (for those who care). OVERALL 6/10: 'In the Realm of the Senses' is A FAIR MOVIE FOR WATCHING ALONE or with like-minded people either a) as porn; or b) for analytical comparisons with crime or religion or psychology. As general entertainment, though, it is of VERY LOW VALUE.

I won't lie and say that there aren't times when the film is tedious and even dull, or that its final conclusion is extremely profound. But it's one hell of an experience, and a disgusting gonzo film that needed to be made. It's one of those films that you don't watch, you live through.

    In the realm of senses is quite simply a movie like no other. There are simply no words to describe what the movie was like. Without giving away the details, I can say that this movie is about a very obsessive sexual relationship between a man and his servant. So obsessive that they actually don't give a darn about anything that happens. Where their obsession takes them in the end is basically the story of the film. Although the premise seems rather off-beat, the story was handled very well by the director Nagisa Oshima and the actors did a very good job. The art was good and the music was effective enough. The deeper you go into the movie, the deeper the characters go into their sexual unhealthy obsession and the more concerned you become about their fate. This movie is, in NO WAY, a PORNO. You can call it naked art if you want. And yes, the sex was not dry. But who would watch an entire 100 minutes of a movie like this by only focusing on the story? The sex scenes were pretty explicit and real(as in UN-simulated). Still, all of them had their part in the story-telling. Also, one very important point to be considered while trying to interpret this film, if one would want to, is that the story is completely character-driven. Looking at the movie in this perspective helps in a better viewing. The movie goes beyond it's NC-17 rating, but more importantly, the movie goes beyond the day-to-day reality and shows something that is so shocking, so disturbing and so depressing that in the end, you will be left utterly speechless. It is indeed, beyond the realm of senses, showing how related yet far-away, love and sex are. I watched this movie three days ago and it still hasn't left me, quite literally. If not for anything else, watch it for the guts it shows in handling such a daring taboo-breaking subject very well and being very artistic without becoming sleazy and filthy for even one moment. A horribly under-rated masterpiece which only demands an open mind from the user to perform in its fullest. A truly UN-forgettable experience.

    "In the Realm of the Senses" aroused MUCH controversy in 70's and it's a kind of movie which only could be made in that decade. Even a lot of controversial flicks in 70's(like last tango in Paris) could be easily rated PG in comparison with this one! "Love & Cascrate" as the motif , is explicitly illustrated in the most shocking scenes & it's difficult to watch for a general viewer. honestly i never understood what is it all about, but tough buffs of this movie(& they are many) believe in Oshmia's perfect use of mise en scene in describing a mentally-disturbed female character. no wonder that it's the most favorite movie of Catherine Breillat.( top ten choosing in Sight n Sound 2002)

    An adulterer's favorite partner's obsessions continually worsen, unchecked. The extreme results of this true story inspired the making of 'In the Realm of the Senses'. Not everyone will appreciate the straightforward telling of this story. You must be okay with viewing graphic nudity, explicit sex acts and consensual violence. Most countries limit viewing to adults. Some have outlawed it entirely. No English audio exists  just subtitles. Pros include: 1. The uncensored escalation of risks accepted by an over-trusting man. 2. Contextual foundations leading to each scene. This is not director-fantasy pornography. 3. Good acting, cinematography and flow of events. Cons include: 1. The storyline is too narrow. Although sex was exclusively what led to the events, such focus belongs in a documentary format rather than in a traditional movie. 2. Way too visual for today's free audiences. For most people, it likely evokes either abhorrence or sexual arousal, leaving less of the viewer's attention on the story itself (for those who care). OVERALL 6/10: 'In the Realm of the Senses' is A FAIR MOVIE FOR WATCHING ALONE or with like-minded people either a) as porn; or b) for analytical comparisons with crime or religion or psychology. As general entertainment, though, it is of VERY LOW VALUE.

    Nagisa "Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence" Oshima's most notorious film culminates with a truly shocking ending, encapsulating the sheer force of self-destructive passion between Kichi (Tatsuya Fuji) and Sada (Eiko Matsuda). It's an apt, inevitable climax. The film sees a master, Kichi, take a servant, Sada, as his concubine. The balance of power quickly shifts, however, as Kichi struggles to come to terms with Sada's insatiable, and increasingly dangerous, sensual appetite. Together they push away a prudish world that would label them perverts; with the help of a carefully inserted boiled egg, they even mock the institution of procreation. Though notions of class are touched upon (Sada, drawn from prostitution and servitude, refers to her desire to be "respectable" when with Kichi as well as a particularly paternal client), really this is a film about sex and death. You certainly can't fault it for scope of ambition, and yet its narrow - nay blinkered - focus on its deliriously conflicted protagonists is perhaps its greatest strength. After the opening scenes, Kichi and Sada dominate every last coital frame. I've found the film becomes sadder, more poignant, with repeated viewings. The addiction is palpable, the self-annihilation agonising - not only in the characters' actions but in their changing faces: the terrible anxiety that what they share is transient; the haunting knowledge that death at the zenith is preferable to a slow decline. I'll paddle into the art versus porn debate by saying that those looking for titillation from this film will probably find it - but they will also find a heartfelt, insightful and ultimately devastating portrait of extreme human desire.

    Perverted eroticism or work of art? This will be a long debate. To be honest I saw this film after seeing The Gray man (2007), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), and Albert Fish: In Sin He found Salvation (2007), Dahmer (2002), The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), To Catch a Killer (TV 1992). The above films I have mentioned all contain a theme: sex oriented killings due to an unfulfilled sexual fantasy. This film proves what sex beyond the limits can lead to. Sex should be done lovingly, with romance and understanding between the couple. Both should be deeply in love with one another and be satisfied with that. A wife is NOT A PROSTITUTE, she is YOUR COMPANION FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You are her shield and protector and to think of another woman is committing a grave sin. Sex with another woman while you are married to a faithful wife is adultery and you are only cheating yourself. If your wife fails to take an interest in sex, there are sex therapists available and counseling as well. You could even go on a vacation and re-ignite your love life. Also you could try out new sex positions you have never explored. There are DVD's which teach advanced lovemaking techniques. THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. This is the most HORRIFYING aspect of the film. THAT IT REALLY OCCURRED AS PORTRAYED IN THE FILM. Plot: Kichizo Ishida a married man falls in love with a woman called Sada Abe. Ishida is unsatisfied with his own wife due to his abnormally high libido. Sada Aba appears to be what we now call a nymphomaniac who cannot be satisfied by a normal man. This chance meeting leads to an explosion of unrestricted sex between the two which goes out of control towards the climax of the film, where Sada strangles and kills Ishida (only after he gives her his full consent to do it). Later she severs his penis. Director Noboru Tanaka's film: A Woman Called Sada Abe is another more sexually oriented film of the same story. Many critics have written that the film is also an exploration of how eroticism in Japanese culture is often morbid or death-obsessed. The film's director Nagisa &Ocirc;shima was also criticized for using explicit sex to draw attention to the film, but the director has stated that the explicitness is an integral part of the movie's design. Controversy: Strict censorship laws would not have allowed the film to be completed as per Oshima's vision in Japan. To get around this, the production was officially listed as a French enterprise, and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for processing and editing. At its premi&egrave;re in Japan, the sexual activity was optically censored. In the US, the film was initially banned upon its premi&egrave;re at the 1976 New York Film Festival, but later screened uncut; a similar fate awaited the film when it was released in Germany. The film was not available on home video until 1990. The British Board of Film Censors, at the time of its first limited screenings in the UK, recommended it be shown under private 'cinema club' conditions to avoid the need for cuts to be made, but only after the Obscene Publications Act had been extended to films (in 1977) to avoid potential legal problems. More recently the BBFC has granted the film an "18" certificate (suitable for adults only), leaving all of the adult sexual activity intact, but ordered that a shot showing a prepubescent boy having his penis pulled as punishment be optically reframed so that the act itself was not shown.The film has been made available, however, in completely uncut form in France, the United States (including the current The Criterion Collection DVD), the Netherlands, and several other territories. In Canada, when originally submitted to the provincial film boards in the 1970s, the film was rejected in all jurisdictions except Quebec. It was not until 1991 that individual provinces approved the film and gave it a certificate. However, in the Maritimes the film was rejected again as the policies followed in the 1970s were still enforced. You can watch Noboru Tanaka's film after this one. Also L'amant (1992) a.k.a. The Lover is another good film to see. Basic Instinct (1992) is another film that immediately springs to mind, as well as Fatal Attraction (1987). If you are a film lover and want recommendations.

    This French-Japanese film, also known as Ai No Corrida, I knew was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but then I found out that it featured real sexual intercourse, oral and various other intimate acts, so I had to see if a good story fit with it as well. Basically in 1936, Tokyo, former prostitute Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) works now as a maid in a hotel, and she is molested by the owner of the hotel Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji), but she is not offended by it and the two of them begin an intense affair. They make love passionately with all kinds of sexual experimentation, drinking and other various forms of self-indulgence, and they do not seem to be bothered with people walking in on them, and to pursue his affair with her Ishida leaves his wife and family. As time passes Abe for some reason becomes jealous of Ishida, probably in terms of receiving pleasure, and she also becomes very possessive, but all he ever wants to do is make her happy, whether it means more intense experimental sex. They become so obsessed with their escalating attempts to achieve the ultimate love making experience and orgasm that he allows her to engage in sadomasochism, this mostly involves her strangling during lovemaking. Eventually it comes to the point when Ishida is killed by Abe strangling him to death, but she is not completely phased by his death, in fact she goes as far to cut off his penis and testicles, and with his blood write the words "Sada Kichi the two of us forever" on his chest. Being based on a true event the real woman was arrested for the crime of murder, but in fact many people who heard about the story were empathetic towards her because of the passionate love she had for the man. Also starring Aoi Nakajima as Toku, Meika Seri as Maid Matsuko and Taiji Tonoyama as Old Beggar. I will be honest and say first that I was most intrigued to see real lovemaking on screen, and it is not something I have seen often in a foreign film regarded by critics, but then I remembered seeing a clip of the controversial ending on a programme, very hard to watch, it is a very interesting insight into how extreme passion can sometimes go too far, a most watchable erotic drama based on a true story. It was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    This was disturbing to watch. First of all, one needs to buy into its cultural me milieu. Then we need to begin to accept the two fundamental characters and how they meld into that setting. This is a story of unbridled sensualism. It's soft one moment and hideous the next. The movie is incredibly graphic and I'm sure the release frightened and confused its patrons. I have to admit, I never really fell under its spell. As a matter of fact, I think I felt that I was invading a sick kind of world. Was I seeing people or monsters? There is great effort at times to prevent it from moving into the next level. The performances aren't really sexual as much as sadistic. This is proved out.

    I found myself confused about what the film maker was trying to convey. It is true that there are graphic sex scenes that caused me to press the forward button. I felt the movie was about a woman's toxic obsession and the man's willing to do whatever it took to fulfill her insatiable desires. I must say that the director and actors were daring to be willing to take part telling this true story, which I Googled after watching the movie. I would say to watch the movie for yourself and decide what you think. I found it interesting that the story seemed to be told without judgment of the characters. It was just a frank narrative of a tragic story of a twisted love affair. This movie is not for the faint at heart.

    A former prostitute, Sada, starts working as a maid at a hotel and is assaulted by the owner, Kichizo, and the two soon begin a torrid affair with many sado masochistic aspects to the relationship. Kichizo leaves his wife and family to please his demanding lover. He becomes obsessively jealous of his insatiable soul mate. The lovemaking becomes more and more violent until Kichizo requests that Sada strangle him while they are engaged in the act. In the realm of the senses is an extremely graphic film for a main stream movie, so if you are offended by explicit sex and gory violence, stay away from this and rent a Disney feature instead.

    For better or for worse, there aren't a lot of movies out there like In the Realm of the Senses. Well, there's porn, but this isn't really porn -- it lets the ugliness as well as the beauty of sex shine through, and through all the cinematographic haze it seems considerably more real than depictions of sex in even "regular" movies. There's a narrative here, told through the slowly-unfolding patterns of debauchery, one of a terrifying spiral of hedonism. In the end, despite all of its explicitness, it's more of a conservative cautionary tale than anything else. What makes In The Realm of the Senses work as well as it does is the beautiful images and almost mystical pacing of director Oshima. I won't lie and say that there aren't times when the film is tedious and even dull, or that its final conclusion is extremely profound.

Being based on a true event the real woman was arrested for the crime of murder, but in fact many people who heard about the story were empathetic towards her because of the passionate love she had for the man. Also starring Aoi Nakajima as Toku, Meika Seri as Maid Matsuko and Taiji Tonoyama as Old Beggar. I will be honest and say first that I was most intrigued to see real lovemaking on screen, and it is not something I have seen often in a foreign film regarded by critics, but then I remembered seeing a clip of the controversial ending on a programme, very hard to watch, it is a very interesting insight into how extreme passion can sometimes go too far, a most watchable erotic drama based on a true story. It was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    This was disturbing to watch. First of all, one needs to buy into its cultural me milieu. Then we need to begin to accept the two fundamental characters and how they meld into that setting. This is a story of unbridled sensualism. It's soft one moment and hideous the next. The movie is incredibly graphic and I'm sure the release frightened and confused its patrons. I have to admit, I never really fell under its spell. As a matter of fact, I think I felt that I was invading a sick kind of world. Was I seeing people or monsters? There is great effort at times to prevent it from moving into the next level. The performances aren't really sexual as much as sadistic. This is proved out.

    I found myself confused about what the film maker was trying to convey. It is true that there are graphic sex scenes that caused me to press the forward button. I felt the movie was about a woman's toxic obsession and the man's willing to do whatever it took to fulfill her insatiable desires. I must say that the director and actors were daring to be willing to take part telling this true story, which I Googled after watching the movie. I would say to watch the movie for yourself and decide what you think. I found it interesting that the story seemed to be told without judgment of the characters. It was just a frank narrative of a tragic story of a twisted love affair. This movie is not for the faint at heart.

    A former prostitute, Sada, starts working as a maid at a hotel and is assaulted by the owner, Kichizo, and the two soon begin a torrid affair with many sado masochistic aspects to the relationship. Kichizo leaves his wife and family to please his demanding lover. He becomes obsessively jealous of his insatiable soul mate. The lovemaking becomes more and more violent until Kichizo requests that Sada strangle him while they are engaged in the act. In the realm of the senses is an extremely graphic film for a main stream movie, so if you are offended by explicit sex and gory violence, stay away from this and rent a Disney feature instead.

    For better or for worse, there aren't a lot of movies out there like In the Realm of the Senses. Well, there's porn, but this isn't really porn -- it lets the ugliness as well as the beauty of sex shine through, and through all the cinematographic haze it seems considerably more real than depictions of sex in even "regular" movies. There's a narrative here, told through the slowly-unfolding patterns of debauchery, one of a terrifying spiral of hedonism. In the end, despite all of its explicitness, it's more of a conservative cautionary tale than anything else. What makes In The Realm of the Senses work as well as it does is the beautiful images and almost mystical pacing of director Oshima. I won't lie and say that there aren't times when the film is tedious and even dull, or that its final conclusion is extremely profound. But it's one hell of an experience, and a disgusting gonzo film that needed to be made. It's one of those films that you don't watch, you live through.

    In the realm of senses is quite simply a movie like no other. There are simply no words to describe what the movie was like. Without giving away the details, I can say that this movie is about a very obsessive sexual relationship between a man and his servant. So obsessive that they actually don't give a darn about anything that happens. Where their obsession takes them in the end is basically the story of the film. Although the premise seems rather off-beat, the story was handled very well by the director Nagisa Oshima and the actors did a very good job. The art was good and the music was effective enough. The deeper you go into the movie, the deeper the characters go into their sexual unhealthy obsession and the more concerned you become about their fate. This movie is, in NO WAY, a PORNO. You can call it naked art if you want. And yes, the sex was not dry. But who would watch an entire 100 minutes of a movie like this by only focusing on the story? The sex scenes were pretty explicit and real(as in UN-simulated). Still, all of them had their part in the story-telling. Also, one very important point to be considered while trying to interpret this film, if one would want to, is that the story is completely character-driven. Looking at the movie in this perspective helps in a better viewing. The movie goes beyond it's NC-17 rating, but more importantly, the movie goes beyond the day-to-day reality and shows something that is so shocking, so disturbing and so depressing that in the end, you will be left utterly speechless. It is indeed, beyond the realm of senses, showing how related yet far-away, love and sex are. I watched this movie three days ago and it still hasn't left me, quite literally. If not for anything else, watch it for the guts it shows in handling such a daring taboo-breaking subject very well and being very artistic without becoming sleazy and filthy for even one moment. A horribly under-rated masterpiece which only demands an open mind from the user to perform in its fullest. A truly UN-forgettable experience.

    "In the Realm of the Senses" aroused MUCH controversy in 70's and it's a kind of movie which only could be made in that decade. Even a lot of controversial flicks in 70's(like last tango in Paris) could be easily rated PG in comparison with this one! "Love & Cascrate" as the motif , is explicitly illustrated in the most shocking scenes & it's difficult to watch for a general viewer. honestly i never understood what is it all about, but tough buffs of this movie(& they are many) believe in Oshmia's perfect use of mise en scene in describing a mentally-disturbed female character. no wonder that it's the most favorite movie of Catherine Breillat.( top ten choosing in Sight n Sound 2002)

    An adulterer's favorite partner's obsessions continually worsen, unchecked. The extreme results of this true story inspired the making of 'In the Realm of the Senses'. Not everyone will appreciate the straightforward telling of this story. You must be okay with viewing graphic nudity, explicit sex acts and consensual violence. Most countries limit viewing to adults. Some have outlawed it entirely. No English audio exists  just subtitles. Pros include: 1. The uncensored escalation of risks accepted by an over-trusting man. 2. Contextual foundations leading to each scene. This is not director-fantasy pornography. 3. Good acting, cinematography and flow of events. Cons include: 1. The storyline is too narrow. Although sex was exclusively what led to the events, such focus belongs in a documentary format rather than in a traditional movie. 2. Way too visual for today's free audiences. For most people, it likely evokes either abhorrence or sexual arousal, leaving less of the viewer's attention on the story itself (for those who care). OVERALL 6/10: 'In the Realm of the Senses' is A FAIR MOVIE FOR WATCHING ALONE or with like-minded people either a) as porn; or b) for analytical comparisons with crime or religion or psychology. As general entertainment, though, it is of VERY LOW VALUE.

    Nagisa "Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence" Oshima's most notorious film culminates with a truly shocking ending, encapsulating the sheer force of self-destructive passion between Kichi (Tatsuya Fuji) and Sada (Eiko Matsuda). It's an apt, inevitable climax. The film sees a master, Kichi, take a servant, Sada, as his concubine. The balance of power quickly shifts, however, as Kichi struggles to come to terms with Sada's insatiable, and increasingly dangerous, sensual appetite. Together they push away a prudish world that would label them perverts; with the help of a carefully inserted boiled egg, they even mock the institution of procreation. Though notions of class are touched upon (Sada, drawn from prostitution and servitude, refers to her desire to be "respectable" when with Kichi as well as a particularly paternal client), really this is a film about sex and death. You certainly can't fault it for scope of ambition, and yet its narrow - nay blinkered - focus on its deliriously conflicted protagonists is perhaps its greatest strength. After the opening scenes, Kichi and Sada dominate every last coital frame. I've found the film becomes sadder, more poignant, with repeated viewings. The addiction is palpable, the self-annihilation agonising - not only in the characters' actions but in their changing faces: the terrible anxiety that what they share is transient; the haunting knowledge that death at the zenith is preferable to a slow decline. I'll paddle into the art versus porn debate by saying that those looking for titillation from this film will probably find it - but they will also find a heartfelt, insightful and ultimately devastating portrait of extreme human desire.

    Perverted eroticism or work of art? This will be a long debate. To be honest I saw this film after seeing The Gray man (2007), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), and Albert Fish: In Sin He found Salvation (2007), Dahmer (2002), The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), To Catch a Killer (TV 1992). The above films I have mentioned all contain a theme: sex oriented killings due to an unfulfilled sexual fantasy. This film proves what sex beyond the limits can lead to. Sex should be done lovingly, with romance and understanding between the couple. Both should be deeply in love with one another and be satisfied with that. A wife is NOT A PROSTITUTE, she is YOUR COMPANION FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You are her shield and protector and to think of another woman is committing a grave sin. Sex with another woman while you are married to a faithful wife is adultery and you are only cheating yourself. If your wife fails to take an interest in sex, there are sex therapists available and counseling as well. You could even go on a vacation and re-ignite your love life. Also you could try out new sex positions you have never explored. There are DVD's which teach advanced lovemaking techniques. THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. This is the most HORRIFYING aspect of the film. THAT IT REALLY OCCURRED AS PORTRAYED IN THE FILM. Plot: Kichizo Ishida a married man falls in love with a woman called Sada Abe. Ishida is unsatisfied with his own wife due to his abnormally high libido. Sada Aba appears to be what we now call a nymphomaniac who cannot be satisfied by a normal man. This chance meeting leads to an explosion of unrestricted sex between the two which goes out of control towards the climax of the film, where Sada strangles and kills Ishida (only after he gives her his full consent to do it). Later she severs his penis. Director Noboru Tanaka's film: A Woman Called Sada Abe is another more sexually oriented film of the same story. Many critics have written that the film is also an exploration of how eroticism in Japanese culture is often morbid or death-obsessed. The film's director Nagisa &Ocirc;shima was also criticized for using explicit sex to draw attention to the film, but the director has stated that the explicitness is an integral part of the movie's design. Controversy: Strict censorship laws would not have allowed the film to be completed as per Oshima's vision in Japan. To get around this, the production was officially listed as a French enterprise, and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for processing and editing. At its premi&egrave;re in Japan, the sexual activity was optically censored. In the US, the film was initially banned upon its premi&egrave;re at the 1976 New York Film Festival, but later screened uncut; a similar fate awaited the film when it was released in Germany. The film was not available on home video until 1990. The British Board of Film Censors, at the time of its first limited screenings in the UK, recommended it be shown under private 'cinema club' conditions to avoid the need for cuts to be made, but only after the Obscene Publications Act had been extended to films (in 1977) to avoid potential legal problems. More recently the BBFC has granted the film an "18" certificate (suitable for adults only), leaving all of the adult sexual activity intact, but ordered that a shot showing a prepubescent boy having his penis pulled as punishment be optically reframed so that the act itself was not shown.The film has been made available, however, in completely uncut form in France, the United States (including the current The Criterion Collection DVD), the Netherlands, and several other territories. In Canada, when originally submitted to the provincial film boards in the 1970s, the film was rejected in all jurisdictions except Quebec. It was not until 1991 that individual provinces approved the film and gave it a certificate. However, in the Maritimes the film was rejected again as the policies followed in the 1970s were still enforced. You can watch Noboru Tanaka's film after this one. Also L'amant (1992) a.k.a. The Lover is another good film to see. Basic Instinct (1992) is another film that immediately springs to mind, as well as Fatal Attraction (1987). If you are a film lover and want recommendations.

    This French-Japanese film, also known as Ai No Corrida, I knew was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but then I found out that it featured real sexual intercourse, oral and various other intimate acts, so I had to see if a good story fit with it as well. Basically in 1936, Tokyo, former prostitute Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) works now as a maid in a hotel, and she is molested by the owner of the hotel Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji), but she is not offended by it and the two of them begin an intense affair. They make love passionately with all kinds of sexual experimentation, drinking and other various forms of self-indulgence, and they do not seem to be bothered with people walking in on them, and to pursue his affair with her Ishida leaves his wife and family. As time passes Abe for some reason becomes jealous of Ishida, probably in terms of receiving pleasure, and she also becomes very possessive, but all he ever wants to do is make her happy, whether it means more intense experimental sex. They become so obsessed with their escalating attempts to achieve the ultimate love making experience and orgasm that he allows her to engage in sadomasochism, this mostly involves her strangling during lovemaking. Eventually it comes to the point when Ishida is killed by Abe strangling him to death, but she is not completely phased by his death, in fact she goes as far to cut off his penis and testicles, and with his blood write the words "Sada Kichi the two of us forever" on his chest. Being based on a true event the real woman was arrested for the crime of murder, but in fact many people who heard about the story were empathetic towards her because of the passionate love she had for the man. Also starring Aoi Nakajima as Toku, Meika Seri as Maid Matsuko and Taiji Tonoyama as Old Beggar. I will be honest and say first that I was most intrigued to see real lovemaking on screen, and it is not something I have seen often in a foreign film regarded by critics, but then I remembered seeing a clip of the controversial ending on a programme, very hard to watch, it is a very interesting insight into how extreme passion can sometimes go too far, a most watchable erotic drama based on a true story.

Sex with another woman while you are married to a faithful wife is adultery and you are only cheating yourself. If your wife fails to take an interest in sex, there are sex therapists available and counseling as well. You could even go on a vacation and re-ignite your love life. Also you could try out new sex positions you have never explored. There are DVD's which teach advanced lovemaking techniques. THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. This is the most HORRIFYING aspect of the film. THAT IT REALLY OCCURRED AS PORTRAYED IN THE FILM. Plot: Kichizo Ishida a married man falls in love with a woman called Sada Abe. Ishida is unsatisfied with his own wife due to his abnormally high libido. Sada Aba appears to be what we now call a nymphomaniac who cannot be satisfied by a normal man. This chance meeting leads to an explosion of unrestricted sex between the two which goes out of control towards the climax of the film, where Sada strangles and kills Ishida (only after he gives her his full consent to do it). Later she severs his penis. Director Noboru Tanaka's film: A Woman Called Sada Abe is another more sexually oriented film of the same story. Many critics have written that the film is also an exploration of how eroticism in Japanese culture is often morbid or death-obsessed. The film's director Nagisa &Ocirc;shima was also criticized for using explicit sex to draw attention to the film, but the director has stated that the explicitness is an integral part of the movie's design. Controversy: Strict censorship laws would not have allowed the film to be completed as per Oshima's vision in Japan. To get around this, the production was officially listed as a French enterprise, and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for processing and editing. At its premi&egrave;re in Japan, the sexual activity was optically censored. In the US, the film was initially banned upon its premi&egrave;re at the 1976 New York Film Festival, but later screened uncut; a similar fate awaited the film when it was released in Germany. The film was not available on home video until 1990. The British Board of Film Censors, at the time of its first limited screenings in the UK, recommended it be shown under private 'cinema club' conditions to avoid the need for cuts to be made, but only after the Obscene Publications Act had been extended to films (in 1977) to avoid potential legal problems. More recently the BBFC has granted the film an "18" certificate (suitable for adults only), leaving all of the adult sexual activity intact, but ordered that a shot showing a prepubescent boy having his penis pulled as punishment be optically reframed so that the act itself was not shown.The film has been made available, however, in completely uncut form in France, the United States (including the current The Criterion Collection DVD), the Netherlands, and several other territories. In Canada, when originally submitted to the provincial film boards in the 1970s, the film was rejected in all jurisdictions except Quebec. It was not until 1991 that individual provinces approved the film and gave it a certificate. However, in the Maritimes the film was rejected again as the policies followed in the 1970s were still enforced. You can watch Noboru Tanaka's film after this one. Also L'amant (1992) a.k.a. The Lover is another good film to see. Basic Instinct (1992) is another film that immediately springs to mind, as well as Fatal Attraction (1987). If you are a film lover and want recommendations.

    This French-Japanese film, also known as Ai No Corrida, I knew was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but then I found out that it featured real sexual intercourse, oral and various other intimate acts, so I had to see if a good story fit with it as well. Basically in 1936, Tokyo, former prostitute Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) works now as a maid in a hotel, and she is molested by the owner of the hotel Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji), but she is not offended by it and the two of them begin an intense affair. They make love passionately with all kinds of sexual experimentation, drinking and other various forms of self-indulgence, and they do not seem to be bothered with people walking in on them, and to pursue his affair with her Ishida leaves his wife and family. As time passes Abe for some reason becomes jealous of Ishida, probably in terms of receiving pleasure, and she also becomes very possessive, but all he ever wants to do is make her happy, whether it means more intense experimental sex. They become so obsessed with their escalating attempts to achieve the ultimate love making experience and orgasm that he allows her to engage in sadomasochism, this mostly involves her strangling during lovemaking. Eventually it comes to the point when Ishida is killed by Abe strangling him to death, but she is not completely phased by his death, in fact she goes as far to cut off his penis and testicles, and with his blood write the words "Sada Kichi the two of us forever" on his chest. Being based on a true event the real woman was arrested for the crime of murder, but in fact many people who heard about the story were empathetic towards her because of the passionate love she had for the man. Also starring Aoi Nakajima as Toku, Meika Seri as Maid Matsuko and Taiji Tonoyama as Old Beggar. I will be honest and say first that I was most intrigued to see real lovemaking on screen, and it is not something I have seen often in a foreign film regarded by critics, but then I remembered seeing a clip of the controversial ending on a programme, very hard to watch, it is a very interesting insight into how extreme passion can sometimes go too far, a most watchable erotic drama based on a true story. It was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    This was disturbing to watch. First of all, one needs to buy into its cultural me milieu. Then we need to begin to accept the two fundamental characters and how they meld into that setting. This is a story of unbridled sensualism. It's soft one moment and hideous the next. The movie is incredibly graphic and I'm sure the release frightened and confused its patrons. I have to admit, I never really fell under its spell. As a matter of fact, I think I felt that I was invading a sick kind of world. Was I seeing people or monsters? There is great effort at times to prevent it from moving into the next level. The performances aren't really sexual as much as sadistic. This is proved out.

    I found myself confused about what the film maker was trying to convey. It is true that there are graphic sex scenes that caused me to press the forward button. I felt the movie was about a woman's toxic obsession and the man's willing to do whatever it took to fulfill her insatiable desires. I must say that the director and actors were daring to be willing to take part telling this true story, which I Googled after watching the movie. I would say to watch the movie for yourself and decide what you think. I found it interesting that the story seemed to be told without judgment of the characters. It was just a frank narrative of a tragic story of a twisted love affair. This movie is not for the faint at heart.

    A former prostitute, Sada, starts working as a maid at a hotel and is assaulted by the owner, Kichizo, and the two soon begin a torrid affair with many sado masochistic aspects to the relationship. Kichizo leaves his wife and family to please his demanding lover. He becomes obsessively jealous of his insatiable soul mate. The lovemaking becomes more and more violent until Kichizo requests that Sada strangle him while they are engaged in the act. In the realm of the senses is an extremely graphic film for a main stream movie, so if you are offended by explicit sex and gory violence, stay away from this and rent a Disney feature instead.

    For better or for worse, there aren't a lot of movies out there like In the Realm of the Senses. Well, there's porn, but this isn't really porn -- it lets the ugliness as well as the beauty of sex shine through, and through all the cinematographic haze it seems considerably more real than depictions of sex in even "regular" movies. There's a narrative here, told through the slowly-unfolding patterns of debauchery, one of a terrifying spiral of hedonism. In the end, despite all of its explicitness, it's more of a conservative cautionary tale than anything else. What makes In The Realm of the Senses work as well as it does is the beautiful images and almost mystical pacing of director Oshima. I won't lie and say that there aren't times when the film is tedious and even dull, or that its final conclusion is extremely profound. But it's one hell of an experience, and a disgusting gonzo film that needed to be made. It's one of those films that you don't watch, you live through.

    In the realm of senses is quite simply a movie like no other. There are simply no words to describe what the movie was like. Without giving away the details, I can say that this movie is about a very obsessive sexual relationship between a man and his servant. So obsessive that they actually don't give a darn about anything that happens. Where their obsession takes them in the end is basically the story of the film. Although the premise seems rather off-beat, the story was handled very well by the director Nagisa Oshima and the actors did a very good job. The art was good and the music was effective enough. The deeper you go into the movie, the deeper the characters go into their sexual unhealthy obsession and the more concerned you become about their fate. This movie is, in NO WAY, a PORNO. You can call it naked art if you want. And yes, the sex was not dry. But who would watch an entire 100 minutes of a movie like this by only focusing on the story? The sex scenes were pretty explicit and real(as in UN-simulated). Still, all of them had their part in the story-telling. Also, one very important point to be considered while trying to interpret this film, if one would want to, is that the story is completely character-driven. Looking at the movie in this perspective helps in a better viewing. The movie goes beyond it's NC-17 rating, but more importantly, the movie goes beyond the day-to-day reality and shows something that is so shocking, so disturbing and so depressing that in the end, you will be left utterly speechless. It is indeed, beyond the realm of senses, showing how related yet far-away, love and sex are. I watched this movie three days ago and it still hasn't left me, quite literally. If not for anything else, watch it for the guts it shows in handling such a daring taboo-breaking subject very well and being very artistic without becoming sleazy and filthy for even one moment. A horribly under-rated masterpiece which only demands an open mind from the user to perform in its fullest. A truly UN-forgettable experience.

    "In the Realm of the Senses" aroused MUCH controversy in 70's and it's a kind of movie which only could be made in that decade. Even a lot of controversial flicks in 70's(like last tango in Paris) could be easily rated PG in comparison with this one! "Love & Cascrate" as the motif , is explicitly illustrated in the most shocking scenes & it's difficult to watch for a general viewer. honestly i never understood what is it all about, but tough buffs of this movie(& they are many) believe in Oshmia's perfect use of mise en scene in describing a mentally-disturbed female character. no wonder that it's the most favorite movie of Catherine Breillat.( top ten choosing in Sight n Sound 2002)

    An adulterer's favorite partner's obsessions continually worsen, unchecked. The extreme results of this true story inspired the making of 'In the Realm of the Senses'. Not everyone will appreciate the straightforward telling of this story. You must be okay with viewing graphic nudity, explicit sex acts and consensual violence. Most countries limit viewing to adults. Some have outlawed it entirely. No English audio exists  just subtitles. Pros include: 1. The uncensored escalation of risks accepted by an over-trusting man. 2. Contextual foundations leading to each scene. This is not director-fantasy pornography. 3. Good acting, cinematography and flow of events. Cons include: 1. The storyline is too narrow. Although sex was exclusively what led to the events, such focus belongs in a documentary format rather than in a traditional movie. 2. Way too visual for today's free audiences. For most people, it likely evokes either abhorrence or sexual arousal, leaving less of the viewer's attention on the story itself (for those who care). OVERALL 6/10: 'In the Realm of the Senses' is A FAIR MOVIE FOR WATCHING ALONE or with like-minded people either a) as porn; or b) for analytical comparisons with crime or religion or psychology. As general entertainment, though, it is of VERY LOW VALUE.

    Nagisa "Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence" Oshima's most notorious film culminates with a truly shocking ending, encapsulating the sheer force of self-destructive passion between Kichi (Tatsuya Fuji) and Sada (Eiko Matsuda). It's an apt, inevitable climax. The film sees a master, Kichi, take a servant, Sada, as his concubine. The balance of power quickly shifts, however, as Kichi struggles to come to terms with Sada's insatiable, and increasingly dangerous, sensual appetite. Together they push away a prudish world that would label them perverts; with the help of a carefully inserted boiled egg, they even mock the institution of procreation. Though notions of class are touched upon (Sada, drawn from prostitution and servitude, refers to her desire to be "respectable" when with Kichi as well as a particularly paternal client), really this is a film about sex and death. You certainly can't fault it for scope of ambition, and yet its narrow - nay blinkered - focus on its deliriously conflicted protagonists is perhaps its greatest strength. After the opening scenes, Kichi and Sada dominate every last coital frame. I've found the film becomes sadder, more poignant, with repeated viewings. The addiction is palpable, the self-annihilation agonising - not only in the characters' actions but in their changing faces: the terrible anxiety that what they share is transient; the haunting knowledge that death at the zenith is preferable to a slow decline. I'll paddle into the art versus porn debate by saying that those looking for titillation from this film will probably find it - but they will also find a heartfelt, insightful and ultimately devastating portrait of extreme human desire.

    Perverted eroticism or work of art? This will be a long debate. To be honest I saw this film after seeing The Gray man (2007), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), and Albert Fish: In Sin He found Salvation (2007), Dahmer (2002), The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), To Catch a Killer (TV 1992). The above films I have mentioned all contain a theme: sex oriented killings due to an unfulfilled sexual fantasy. This film proves what sex beyond the limits can lead to. Sex should be done lovingly, with romance and understanding between the couple. Both should be deeply in love with one another and be satisfied with that. A wife is NOT A PROSTITUTE, she is YOUR COMPANION FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You are her shield and protector and to think of another woman is committing a grave sin. Sex with another woman while you are married to a faithful wife is adultery and you are only cheating yourself. If your wife fails to take an interest in sex, there are sex therapists available and counseling as well. You could even go on a vacation and re-ignite your love life. Also you could try out new sex positions you have never explored. There are DVD's which teach advanced lovemaking techniques. THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY.

"Love & Cascrate" as the motif , is explicitly illustrated in the most shocking scenes & it's difficult to watch for a general viewer. honestly i never understood what is it all about, but tough buffs of this movie(& they are many) believe in Oshmia's perfect use of mise en scene in describing a mentally-disturbed female character. no wonder that it's the most favorite movie of Catherine Breillat.( top ten choosing in Sight n Sound 2002)

    An adulterer's favorite partner's obsessions continually worsen, unchecked. The extreme results of this true story inspired the making of 'In the Realm of the Senses'. Not everyone will appreciate the straightforward telling of this story. You must be okay with viewing graphic nudity, explicit sex acts and consensual violence. Most countries limit viewing to adults. Some have outlawed it entirely. No English audio exists  just subtitles. Pros include: 1. The uncensored escalation of risks accepted by an over-trusting man. 2. Contextual foundations leading to each scene. This is not director-fantasy pornography. 3. Good acting, cinematography and flow of events. Cons include: 1. The storyline is too narrow. Although sex was exclusively what led to the events, such focus belongs in a documentary format rather than in a traditional movie. 2. Way too visual for today's free audiences. For most people, it likely evokes either abhorrence or sexual arousal, leaving less of the viewer's attention on the story itself (for those who care). OVERALL 6/10: 'In the Realm of the Senses' is A FAIR MOVIE FOR WATCHING ALONE or with like-minded people either a) as porn; or b) for analytical comparisons with crime or religion or psychology. As general entertainment, though, it is of VERY LOW VALUE.

    Nagisa "Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence" Oshima's most notorious film culminates with a truly shocking ending, encapsulating the sheer force of self-destructive passion between Kichi (Tatsuya Fuji) and Sada (Eiko Matsuda). It's an apt, inevitable climax. The film sees a master, Kichi, take a servant, Sada, as his concubine. The balance of power quickly shifts, however, as Kichi struggles to come to terms with Sada's insatiable, and increasingly dangerous, sensual appetite. Together they push away a prudish world that would label them perverts; with the help of a carefully inserted boiled egg, they even mock the institution of procreation. Though notions of class are touched upon (Sada, drawn from prostitution and servitude, refers to her desire to be "respectable" when with Kichi as well as a particularly paternal client), really this is a film about sex and death. You certainly can't fault it for scope of ambition, and yet its narrow - nay blinkered - focus on its deliriously conflicted protagonists is perhaps its greatest strength. After the opening scenes, Kichi and Sada dominate every last coital frame. I've found the film becomes sadder, more poignant, with repeated viewings. The addiction is palpable, the self-annihilation agonising - not only in the characters' actions but in their changing faces: the terrible anxiety that what they share is transient; the haunting knowledge that death at the zenith is preferable to a slow decline. I'll paddle into the art versus porn debate by saying that those looking for titillation from this film will probably find it - but they will also find a heartfelt, insightful and ultimately devastating portrait of extreme human desire.

    Perverted eroticism or work of art? This will be a long debate. To be honest I saw this film after seeing The Gray man (2007), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), and Albert Fish: In Sin He found Salvation (2007), Dahmer (2002), The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), To Catch a Killer (TV 1992). The above films I have mentioned all contain a theme: sex oriented killings due to an unfulfilled sexual fantasy. This film proves what sex beyond the limits can lead to. Sex should be done lovingly, with romance and understanding between the couple. Both should be deeply in love with one another and be satisfied with that. A wife is NOT A PROSTITUTE, she is YOUR COMPANION FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You are her shield and protector and to think of another woman is committing a grave sin. Sex with another woman while you are married to a faithful wife is adultery and you are only cheating yourself. If your wife fails to take an interest in sex, there are sex therapists available and counseling as well. You could even go on a vacation and re-ignite your love life. Also you could try out new sex positions you have never explored. There are DVD's which teach advanced lovemaking techniques. THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. This is the most HORRIFYING aspect of the film. THAT IT REALLY OCCURRED AS PORTRAYED IN THE FILM. Plot: Kichizo Ishida a married man falls in love with a woman called Sada Abe. Ishida is unsatisfied with his own wife due to his abnormally high libido. Sada Aba appears to be what we now call a nymphomaniac who cannot be satisfied by a normal man. This chance meeting leads to an explosion of unrestricted sex between the two which goes out of control towards the climax of the film, where Sada strangles and kills Ishida (only after he gives her his full consent to do it). Later she severs his penis. Director Noboru Tanaka's film: A Woman Called Sada Abe is another more sexually oriented film of the same story. Many critics have written that the film is also an exploration of how eroticism in Japanese culture is often morbid or death-obsessed. The film's director Nagisa &Ocirc;shima was also criticized for using explicit sex to draw attention to the film, but the director has stated that the explicitness is an integral part of the movie's design. Controversy: Strict censorship laws would not have allowed the film to be completed as per Oshima's vision in Japan. To get around this, the production was officially listed as a French enterprise, and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for processing and editing. At its premi&egrave;re in Japan, the sexual activity was optically censored. In the US, the film was initially banned upon its premi&egrave;re at the 1976 New York Film Festival, but later screened uncut; a similar fate awaited the film when it was released in Germany. The film was not available on home video until 1990. The British Board of Film Censors, at the time of its first limited screenings in the UK, recommended it be shown under private 'cinema club' conditions to avoid the need for cuts to be made, but only after the Obscene Publications Act had been extended to films (in 1977) to avoid potential legal problems. More recently the BBFC has granted the film an "18" certificate (suitable for adults only), leaving all of the adult sexual activity intact, but ordered that a shot showing a prepubescent boy having his penis pulled as punishment be optically reframed so that the act itself was not shown.The film has been made available, however, in completely uncut form in France, the United States (including the current The Criterion Collection DVD), the Netherlands, and several other territories. In Canada, when originally submitted to the provincial film boards in the 1970s, the film was rejected in all jurisdictions except Quebec. It was not until 1991 that individual provinces approved the film and gave it a certificate. However, in the Maritimes the film was rejected again as the policies followed in the 1970s were still enforced. You can watch Noboru Tanaka's film after this one. Also L'amant (1992) a.k.a. The Lover is another good film to see. Basic Instinct (1992) is another film that immediately springs to mind, as well as Fatal Attraction (1987). If you are a film lover and want recommendations.

    This French-Japanese film, also known as Ai No Corrida, I knew was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but then I found out that it featured real sexual intercourse, oral and various other intimate acts, so I had to see if a good story fit with it as well. Basically in 1936, Tokyo, former prostitute Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) works now as a maid in a hotel, and she is molested by the owner of the hotel Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji), but she is not offended by it and the two of them begin an intense affair. They make love passionately with all kinds of sexual experimentation, drinking and other various forms of self-indulgence, and they do not seem to be bothered with people walking in on them, and to pursue his affair with her Ishida leaves his wife and family. As time passes Abe for some reason becomes jealous of Ishida, probably in terms of receiving pleasure, and she also becomes very possessive, but all he ever wants to do is make her happy, whether it means more intense experimental sex. They become so obsessed with their escalating attempts to achieve the ultimate love making experience and orgasm that he allows her to engage in sadomasochism, this mostly involves her strangling during lovemaking. Eventually it comes to the point when Ishida is killed by Abe strangling him to death, but she is not completely phased by his death, in fact she goes as far to cut off his penis and testicles, and with his blood write the words "Sada Kichi the two of us forever" on his chest. Being based on a true event the real woman was arrested for the crime of murder, but in fact many people who heard about the story were empathetic towards her because of the passionate love she had for the man. Also starring Aoi Nakajima as Toku, Meika Seri as Maid Matsuko and Taiji Tonoyama as Old Beggar. I will be honest and say first that I was most intrigued to see real lovemaking on screen, and it is not something I have seen often in a foreign film regarded by critics, but then I remembered seeing a clip of the controversial ending on a programme, very hard to watch, it is a very interesting insight into how extreme passion can sometimes go too far, a most watchable erotic drama based on a true story. It was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    This was disturbing to watch. First of all, one needs to buy into its cultural me milieu. Then we need to begin to accept the two fundamental characters and how they meld into that setting. This is a story of unbridled sensualism. It's soft one moment and hideous the next. The movie is incredibly graphic and I'm sure the release frightened and confused its patrons. I have to admit, I never really fell under its spell. As a matter of fact, I think I felt that I was invading a sick kind of world. Was I seeing people or monsters? There is great effort at times to prevent it from moving into the next level. The performances aren't really sexual as much as sadistic. This is proved out.

    I found myself confused about what the film maker was trying to convey. It is true that there are graphic sex scenes that caused me to press the forward button. I felt the movie was about a woman's toxic obsession and the man's willing to do whatever it took to fulfill her insatiable desires. I must say that the director and actors were daring to be willing to take part telling this true story, which I Googled after watching the movie. I would say to watch the movie for yourself and decide what you think. I found it interesting that the story seemed to be told without judgment of the characters. It was just a frank narrative of a tragic story of a twisted love affair. This movie is not for the faint at heart.

    A former prostitute, Sada, starts working as a maid at a hotel and is assaulted by the owner, Kichizo, and the two soon begin a torrid affair with many sado masochistic aspects to the relationship. Kichizo leaves his wife and family to please his demanding lover. He becomes obsessively jealous of his insatiable soul mate. The lovemaking becomes more and more violent until Kichizo requests that Sada strangle him while they are engaged in the act. In the realm of the senses is an extremely graphic film for a main stream movie, so if you are offended by explicit sex and gory violence, stay away from this and rent a Disney feature instead.

    For better or for worse, there aren't a lot of movies out there like In the Realm of the Senses. Well, there's porn, but this isn't really porn -- it lets the ugliness as well as the beauty of sex shine through, and through all the cinematographic haze it seems considerably more real than depictions of sex in even "regular" movies. There's a narrative here, told through the slowly-unfolding patterns of debauchery, one of a terrifying spiral of hedonism. In the end, despite all of its explicitness, it's more of a conservative cautionary tale than anything else. What makes In The Realm of the Senses work as well as it does is the beautiful images and almost mystical pacing of director Oshima. I won't lie and say that there aren't times when the film is tedious and even dull, or that its final conclusion is extremely profound. But it's one hell of an experience, and a disgusting gonzo film that needed to be made. It's one of those films that you don't watch, you live through.

    In the realm of senses is quite simply a movie like no other. There are simply no words to describe what the movie was like. Without giving away the details, I can say that this movie is about a very obsessive sexual relationship between a man and his servant. So obsessive that they actually don't give a darn about anything that happens. Where their obsession takes them in the end is basically the story of the film. Although the premise seems rather off-beat, the story was handled very well by the director Nagisa Oshima and the actors did a very good job. The art was good and the music was effective enough. The deeper you go into the movie, the deeper the characters go into their sexual unhealthy obsession and the more concerned you become about their fate. This movie is, in NO WAY, a PORNO. You can call it naked art if you want. And yes, the sex was not dry. But who would watch an entire 100 minutes of a movie like this by only focusing on the story? The sex scenes were pretty explicit and real(as in UN-simulated). Still, all of them had their part in the story-telling. Also, one very important point to be considered while trying to interpret this film, if one would want to, is that the story is completely character-driven. Looking at the movie in this perspective helps in a better viewing. The movie goes beyond it's NC-17 rating, but more importantly, the movie goes beyond the day-to-day reality and shows something that is so shocking, so disturbing and so depressing that in the end, you will be left utterly speechless. It is indeed, beyond the realm of senses, showing how related yet far-away, love and sex are. I watched this movie three days ago and it still hasn't left me, quite literally. If not for anything else, watch it for the guts it shows in handling such a daring taboo-breaking subject very well and being very artistic without becoming sleazy and filthy for even one moment. A horribly under-rated masterpiece which only demands an open mind from the user to perform in its fullest. A truly UN-forgettable experience.
