 <sinopse>
  A parody of Jane Austen's novel Emma, about Cher, a popular girl who spends her days playing matchmaker, helping friends with fashion choices, advising the new girl at school on a makeover, and looking for a boyfriend.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Cher, a high school student in Beverly Hills, must survive the ups and downs of adolescent life. Her external demeanor at first seems superficial, but rather it hides her wit, charm, and intelligence which help her to deal with relationships, friends, family, school, and the all-important teenage social life.

    Clueless is a romantic comedy about a group of extremely wealthy teens in Beverly Hills. Cher's (Alicia Silverstone) life revolves around clothes, boys and basically just getting whatever she wants. She can talk her way into or out of anything. Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) decide to make the new girl, Tai (Brittany Murphy), their project and make her as popular as they are. Soon Cher realizes she is the one who actually needs a makeover; only she needs to makeover her soul. She emerges a more caring less clueless individual and finally has found herself that Baldwin she was looking for too. This movie is a great coming of age film about a girl finally realizing that there are more things to life than shopping. Throughout the movie we get to watch and laugh as Cher develops into a far less clueless being than she was, although still pretty clueless. She matures as a character just as the kids of The Breakfast Club do. She actually reminds me of a modern Claire. The story line of the movies while different definitely has some similarities as well. The characters all realize that who you hang out with and where you come from are not as important as the person inside. Cher as well as The Breakfast Club all come out of their experience more mature and with some new great friends. There is a scene where the camera zooms in on Cher as she is thinking of what everyone else does to contribute to the world. It gets in close so that you can her expression and that she truly wants to better herself. Then she says that she wants to help. She decides to head up the disaster relief campaign. I also think it shows a great enlightening moment for her when she is walking and she figures out that she loves Josh (Paul Rudd). All the lights from the fountain that light up behind her and then the music plays with the trumpets right before she looks into the camera. It really pulls you into the scene and makes you feel like it is a magical discovery that has hit her to her core. It changes her entire demeanor around him after this moment too. She gets fidgety and nervous. I think this scene is one of the turning points in Cher maturing as a character. I think this film was a great way to combine a coming of age film with a comedy instead of just a regular drama. You got to watch Cher grow as an individual and get some laughs on the way. I think this movie is an overall good viewing experience.

    I thought this was a wonderful teen h.s. movie.. yeah it's a lot of over the top material sure and some of the stuff that happens in the movie i'm sure actually goes on at high school. I thought that Ms. Silverstone did a really wonderful job with this and should have picked up at least a few awards for her work in the movie. she's funny intelligent, witty, and of course super sexy.. I liked all the different characters in the movie,, it made you kinda sorta wanna care about them in a way... Cher our character has many issues in this movie,, trying to take care of her dad,, finding a boyfriend,, playing miss i'm gonna save the world,, being the most popular girl at school,, doing makeover's for her friends and the like,, all in all I thought that this was a wonderful movie to watch.

    Clueless is almost a film about nothing. We follow the story of sixteen-year-old schoolgirl Cher who is popular, rich and beautiful, and has everybody around her at her fingertips. She's manipulative, selfish and a snob who seems to only have one other high school friend Dionne. Yet despite her major flaws that would generally have the audience hating her, we don't. Cher comes through as a character we really adore and care about due to one major reason, her childish innocence or as the title of the movie puts it her cluelessness. The general synopsis of the film follows Cher (Alicia Silverstone) as she attempts to con and manipulate her teachers into increasing her low grades. A feat her lawyer father encourages and praises her for. She soon gets a taste for meddling into peoples lives and takes in upon herself to give a new girl at the school Tai (Britney Murphy) a makeover and spring her into popularity. Much of the story then follows her naivety in controlling other people and the dynamics of her friendships with a loose love story coming into play towards the end. Despite the weak plot much of what makes Clueless work well as a film is the subtle humor and innocently naive characters you grow to appreciate. It's the film that propelled Alicia Silverstone into the Hollywood spotlight, and of course was also the late Britney Murphy's break through role. It's a high school movie classic that will cause you to laugh out loud many times and a must see for the 90s nostalgia. If you really enjoy the movie check out the 90s follow up TV series of Clueless which see's much of the cast from the movie reunited minus Miss Silverstone.

    Well, after nearly 20 years of only seeing certain scenes in this movie (I was working as an usher when this came out and snuck in some movie-watching time in between shows), I finally watched the whole thing with my mom just now on Netflix disc. In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.

    OK, I know. I'm deliriously in love with Alicia Silverstone. And I know she's already married. A perfectly written film, also directed by Amy Heckerling. The trials and tribulations of affluent high school kids includes Alicia's quest to 'make-over' her heart and soul. Her flawless comedic talent is accompanied by other attractive actors such as Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash, and Justin Walker. Lots of fun for the more mature folks in the audience as well as the younger crowd. Choice music enlivens the soundtrack. Now to more important things..... Alicia, will you marry me?! :)

    This is yet again another trashy adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma. It features downright stupid performances and writing featuring a story that is, even with its "clever" spin on it, clich&eacute; and downright 90's. It's incredible how terrible this film has aged, as there is purely not one thing that made me laugh, care, or interested. Actually, Clueless is just that. It is an emotionless smorgasbord of annoying ideas and teen angst that would be better left never considered and crafted into a film. A film is where we can explore the imagination of the director, experience convincing emotional reward from the cast, and be transported to a different world. Clueless is completely the opposite. The characters are stupid, contrived, silly, and downright unlikeable. There's no artistic value in any of the shots, as it is stuck in that weird 90's limbo of "hey, the 90's are great, let's include everything that we think is great about the 90's in this film." Yeah, that will work, but nearly 20 years later and this film is just plain ugly and gross to look at. Plus, all of the drug and teen partying content is nasty. The last thing we want are girls growing up and watching this and saying "hey, going to parties, getting drunk, smoking weed (among other things) is a perfect way to become popular and find my soul mate!" Really. REALLY? People actually enjoy this dribble? But I digress, just never ever see this film. While nothing is graphic or done strongly, the morals and messages that this film conveys are entirely too stupid to be believable, and I don't care if she changes her heart or becomes a better person or whatever. Only a simpleton would live like Cher, much less like this film. It belongs in the 1990's garbage bin.

    As ifyou haven't seen this 1990s classic, you should now. Back in the mid to upper 1990s, I first saw Clueless and as much as I laughed hard and thoroughly enjoyed it, I knew right then, as fresh as it was, it was going to be a dated movie. Fast forward 18 years, and it's  totally!  still enjoyable, but I agree with my original thought. So, I can see someone saying that it's dated nowadays, especially kids, or anyone that missed it back then. Luckily, I caught it new and still love it just as much. Normally, I hate to be around or watch either bimbos or mimbos, but I had a feeling this movie wasn't glorifying them; instead, they were severely mocking them. But, when the very talented (at least for this role) Alicia Silverstone can play someone with less than half a brain and selfish and yet, contains a full heart, I admire the movie  and her performance  even more. Totally Valley Cher (Silverstone) and her pal, Dionne, spend their time: using up their rich family's money by incessantly shopping, grouping fellow high school kids into segregations and occasionally caring about "the lesser and unfortunate" people, which, in real life, have more going for them than 3 of both Cher and Dionne combined. But, this is a slapstick kind of comedy, so let's try not to get too deep. The first half of the movie is just one example after the next of perky Cher and her high zest in life and an actual "second movie" appears when the ultrathin plot is revealed: Cher's outward appearance doesn't match her insides. She wants companionship and the movie tries to convey that with little success, but enough to give the movie a slight spark of a conflict. It's the second half where the film, unfortunately, loses a little steam and overstays its welcome a bit. All of that doesn't matter; Clueless is not really just that. In a lot of ways, it's brilliant, absolutely hilarious, contains fantastic secondary characters and has both some enormously quotable lines and very funny scenes. Not to mention, the incredible soundtrack that I recall buying immediately following my first viewing. While I like practically every song on the album, Kids in America, the opening title song to the motion picture, is one of my all time movie favorite songs. Since I was part of the pack that saw this before it became pass&eacute;, I believe it still holds up today and it was great to revisit a lot of the scenes, lines and songs I grew up loving. See it, gurl! Side Note: Oh, and Paul (Rudd): I had a huge crush on you back then, and still today. You look so young here, at 26, even though you haven't seemed like you've aged much since. Many people credit this as your first movie, but I knew better  I first noticed, and fell head over heels for you, in the atrocious Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Waitoh, that's why you want people to believe this is your first role. Good call. Side Note II: As many lines in this I still quote today, this was my first introduction to the phrase "A Friend of Dorothy," which means, um, "Not a Fan of Hustler." I died laughing hearing that for the first time, even though it was obvious to whom they were referring to as such in the movie. Maybe, Cher was, in fact, Clueless. Um. Maybe?

    Clueless is a fantastic movie with a good story line,which is a common teen movie story,but the movies comedic cast and hilarious characters make it more fun for all ages.Alicia Silverstone plays the lead character,she is very funny in the movie and also extremely attractive.My favourite part of the movie is Paul Rudd's character Josh,I have never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like,and his characters are always very funny and down to earth,like I imagine he is.I think the whole family can enjoy this movie and I was extremely surprised with how much I enjoyed it. Cher (Alicia Silverstone) lives a high-profile life living with her rich father,and spends most of her time with her friends and putting people together,but Cher realises its time for her to find a boyfriend of her own.

    "Clueless" is one of the classic teen movies from the 1990s. It is feel-good, hilarious and witty. A majority of teen movies tend to involve exaggerated characters, grotesque behaviour and bland dialogues. Not this one. The lead female character, Cher, is spoilt, arrogant, manipulative, good-looking, fashion-obsessed and a daughter of a rich lawyer. Her attempts to help the others improve their personal lives are either motived by her selfish interests or are helpful distractions from her own loneliness, which is mainly a side-effect of her arrogance. Despite all that, her character is in fact very likable, simply because there is no real malice in anything that she does. Plus, she is a genuinely caring daughter. Even her needling jokes at the expense of her a couple of years' older ex step-brother are in fact relatively benign reactions to his unjustifiably stereotypical opinion of her. The other characters are very entertaining and tend to end up looking a lot deeper than what a viewer might think of them when they are first introduced. This is actually quite a refreshing trait of this film. Anyway, what really sets this movie apart from much of the rest of the genre is an abundance of witty retorts. This is what makes you not feel like you can hardly wait for the predictable ending. In sum, "Clueless" is one of the very few movies from the teen comedy genre that I cannot fault.

    Clueless is about a sweet rich girl who is totally clueless about most things in life except for shopping. It sounds terrible, but actually, it's presented in an adorable way. You get attached to the main character very quickly and root her efforts to make the world a better place. It's all setup in the world of the very rich, yet you can't help yourself. Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd have excellent chemistry and are giving us very good acting. The rest of the ensemble is of lesser value, but nothing to detract our attention. The story is simple, elegant, and nice to embark upon. The only thing that I have to pick at? The phones are getting old. And that hat! (You'll see what I mean.) See it, it's sweet.

Since I was part of the pack that saw this before it became pass&eacute;, I believe it still holds up today and it was great to revisit a lot of the scenes, lines and songs I grew up loving. See it, gurl! Side Note: Oh, and Paul (Rudd): I had a huge crush on you back then, and still today. You look so young here, at 26, even though you haven't seemed like you've aged much since. Many people credit this as your first movie, but I knew better  I first noticed, and fell head over heels for you, in the atrocious Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Waitoh, that's why you want people to believe this is your first role. Good call. Side Note II: As many lines in this I still quote today, this was my first introduction to the phrase "A Friend of Dorothy," which means, um, "Not a Fan of Hustler." I died laughing hearing that for the first time, even though it was obvious to whom they were referring to as such in the movie. Maybe, Cher was, in fact, Clueless. Um. Maybe?

    Clueless is a fantastic movie with a good story line,which is a common teen movie story,but the movies comedic cast and hilarious characters make it more fun for all ages.Alicia Silverstone plays the lead character,she is very funny in the movie and also extremely attractive.My favourite part of the movie is Paul Rudd's character Josh,I have never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like,and his characters are always very funny and down to earth,like I imagine he is.I think the whole family can enjoy this movie and I was extremely surprised with how much I enjoyed it. Cher (Alicia Silverstone) lives a high-profile life living with her rich father,and spends most of her time with her friends and putting people together,but Cher realises its time for her to find a boyfriend of her own.

    "Clueless" is one of the classic teen movies from the 1990s. It is feel-good, hilarious and witty. A majority of teen movies tend to involve exaggerated characters, grotesque behaviour and bland dialogues. Not this one. The lead female character, Cher, is spoilt, arrogant, manipulative, good-looking, fashion-obsessed and a daughter of a rich lawyer. Her attempts to help the others improve their personal lives are either motived by her selfish interests or are helpful distractions from her own loneliness, which is mainly a side-effect of her arrogance. Despite all that, her character is in fact very likable, simply because there is no real malice in anything that she does. Plus, she is a genuinely caring daughter. Even her needling jokes at the expense of her a couple of years' older ex step-brother are in fact relatively benign reactions to his unjustifiably stereotypical opinion of her. The other characters are very entertaining and tend to end up looking a lot deeper than what a viewer might think of them when they are first introduced. This is actually quite a refreshing trait of this film. Anyway, what really sets this movie apart from much of the rest of the genre is an abundance of witty retorts. This is what makes you not feel like you can hardly wait for the predictable ending. In sum, "Clueless" is one of the very few movies from the teen comedy genre that I cannot fault.

    Clueless is about a sweet rich girl who is totally clueless about most things in life except for shopping. It sounds terrible, but actually, it's presented in an adorable way. You get attached to the main character very quickly and root her efforts to make the world a better place. It's all setup in the world of the very rich, yet you can't help yourself. Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd have excellent chemistry and are giving us very good acting. The rest of the ensemble is of lesser value, but nothing to detract our attention. The story is simple, elegant, and nice to embark upon. The only thing that I have to pick at? The phones are getting old. And that hat! (You'll see what I mean.) See it, it's sweet.

    Clueless is a romantic comedy about a group of extremely wealthy teens in Beverly Hills. Cher's (Alicia Silverstone) life revolves around clothes, boys and basically just getting whatever she wants. She can talk her way into or out of anything. Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) decide to make the new girl, Tai (Brittany Murphy), their project and make her as popular as they are. Soon Cher realizes she is the one who actually needs a makeover; only she needs to makeover her soul. She emerges a more caring less clueless individual and finally has found herself that Baldwin she was looking for too. This movie is a great coming of age film about a girl finally realizing that there are more things to life than shopping. Throughout the movie we get to watch and laugh as Cher develops into a far less clueless being than she was, although still pretty clueless. She matures as a character just as the kids of The Breakfast Club do. She actually reminds me of a modern Claire. The story line of the movies while different definitely has some similarities as well. The characters all realize that who you hang out with and where you come from are not as important as the person inside. Cher as well as The Breakfast Club all come out of their experience more mature and with some new great friends. There is a scene where the camera zooms in on Cher as she is thinking of what everyone else does to contribute to the world. It gets in close so that you can her expression and that she truly wants to better herself. Then she says that she wants to help. She decides to head up the disaster relief campaign. I also think it shows a great enlightening moment for her when she is walking and she figures out that she loves Josh (Paul Rudd). All the lights from the fountain that light up behind her and then the music plays with the trumpets right before she looks into the camera. It really pulls you into the scene and makes you feel like it is a magical discovery that has hit her to her core. It changes her entire demeanor around him after this moment too. She gets fidgety and nervous. I think this scene is one of the turning points in Cher maturing as a character. I think this film was a great way to combine a coming of age film with a comedy instead of just a regular drama. You got to watch Cher grow as an individual and get some laughs on the way. I think this movie is an overall good viewing experience.

    I thought this was a wonderful teen h.s. movie.. yeah it's a lot of over the top material sure and some of the stuff that happens in the movie i'm sure actually goes on at high school. I thought that Ms. Silverstone did a really wonderful job with this and should have picked up at least a few awards for her work in the movie. she's funny intelligent, witty, and of course super sexy.. I liked all the different characters in the movie,, it made you kinda sorta wanna care about them in a way... Cher our character has many issues in this movie,, trying to take care of her dad,, finding a boyfriend,, playing miss i'm gonna save the world,, being the most popular girl at school,, doing makeover's for her friends and the like,, all in all I thought that this was a wonderful movie to watch.

    Clueless is almost a film about nothing. We follow the story of sixteen-year-old schoolgirl Cher who is popular, rich and beautiful, and has everybody around her at her fingertips. She's manipulative, selfish and a snob who seems to only have one other high school friend Dionne. Yet despite her major flaws that would generally have the audience hating her, we don't. Cher comes through as a character we really adore and care about due to one major reason, her childish innocence or as the title of the movie puts it her cluelessness. The general synopsis of the film follows Cher (Alicia Silverstone) as she attempts to con and manipulate her teachers into increasing her low grades. A feat her lawyer father encourages and praises her for. She soon gets a taste for meddling into peoples lives and takes in upon herself to give a new girl at the school Tai (Britney Murphy) a makeover and spring her into popularity. Much of the story then follows her naivety in controlling other people and the dynamics of her friendships with a loose love story coming into play towards the end. Despite the weak plot much of what makes Clueless work well as a film is the subtle humor and innocently naive characters you grow to appreciate. It's the film that propelled Alicia Silverstone into the Hollywood spotlight, and of course was also the late Britney Murphy's break through role. It's a high school movie classic that will cause you to laugh out loud many times and a must see for the 90s nostalgia. If you really enjoy the movie check out the 90s follow up TV series of Clueless which see's much of the cast from the movie reunited minus Miss Silverstone.

    Well, after nearly 20 years of only seeing certain scenes in this movie (I was working as an usher when this came out and snuck in some movie-watching time in between shows), I finally watched the whole thing with my mom just now on Netflix disc. In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.

    OK, I know. I'm deliriously in love with Alicia Silverstone. And I know she's already married. A perfectly written film, also directed by Amy Heckerling. The trials and tribulations of affluent high school kids includes Alicia's quest to 'make-over' her heart and soul. Her flawless comedic talent is accompanied by other attractive actors such as Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash, and Justin Walker. Lots of fun for the more mature folks in the audience as well as the younger crowd. Choice music enlivens the soundtrack. Now to more important things..... Alicia, will you marry me?! :)

    This is yet again another trashy adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma. It features downright stupid performances and writing featuring a story that is, even with its "clever" spin on it, clich&eacute; and downright 90's. It's incredible how terrible this film has aged, as there is purely not one thing that made me laugh, care, or interested. Actually, Clueless is just that. It is an emotionless smorgasbord of annoying ideas and teen angst that would be better left never considered and crafted into a film. A film is where we can explore the imagination of the director, experience convincing emotional reward from the cast, and be transported to a different world. Clueless is completely the opposite. The characters are stupid, contrived, silly, and downright unlikeable. There's no artistic value in any of the shots, as it is stuck in that weird 90's limbo of "hey, the 90's are great, let's include everything that we think is great about the 90's in this film." Yeah, that will work, but nearly 20 years later and this film is just plain ugly and gross to look at. Plus, all of the drug and teen partying content is nasty. The last thing we want are girls growing up and watching this and saying "hey, going to parties, getting drunk, smoking weed (among other things) is a perfect way to become popular and find my soul mate!" Really. REALLY? People actually enjoy this dribble? But I digress, just never ever see this film. While nothing is graphic or done strongly, the morals and messages that this film conveys are entirely too stupid to be believable, and I don't care if she changes her heart or becomes a better person or whatever. Only a simpleton would live like Cher, much less like this film. It belongs in the 1990's garbage bin.

    As ifyou haven't seen this 1990s classic, you should now. Back in the mid to upper 1990s, I first saw Clueless and as much as I laughed hard and thoroughly enjoyed it, I knew right then, as fresh as it was, it was going to be a dated movie. Fast forward 18 years, and it's  totally!  still enjoyable, but I agree with my original thought. So, I can see someone saying that it's dated nowadays, especially kids, or anyone that missed it back then. Luckily, I caught it new and still love it just as much. Normally, I hate to be around or watch either bimbos or mimbos, but I had a feeling this movie wasn't glorifying them; instead, they were severely mocking them. But, when the very talented (at least for this role) Alicia Silverstone can play someone with less than half a brain and selfish and yet, contains a full heart, I admire the movie  and her performance  even more. Totally Valley Cher (Silverstone) and her pal, Dionne, spend their time: using up their rich family's money by incessantly shopping, grouping fellow high school kids into segregations and occasionally caring about "the lesser and unfortunate" people, which, in real life, have more going for them than 3 of both Cher and Dionne combined. But, this is a slapstick kind of comedy, so let's try not to get too deep. The first half of the movie is just one example after the next of perky Cher and her high zest in life and an actual "second movie" appears when the ultrathin plot is revealed: Cher's outward appearance doesn't match her insides. She wants companionship and the movie tries to convey that with little success, but enough to give the movie a slight spark of a conflict. It's the second half where the film, unfortunately, loses a little steam and overstays its welcome a bit. All of that doesn't matter; Clueless is not really just that. In a lot of ways, it's brilliant, absolutely hilarious, contains fantastic secondary characters and has both some enormously quotable lines and very funny scenes. Not to mention, the incredible soundtrack that I recall buying immediately following my first viewing. While I like practically every song on the album, Kids in America, the opening title song to the motion picture, is one of my all time movie favorite songs. Since I was part of the pack that saw this before it became pass&eacute;, I believe it still holds up today and it was great to revisit a lot of the scenes, lines and songs I grew up loving. See it, gurl! Side Note: Oh, and Paul (Rudd): I had a huge crush on you back then, and still today. You look so young here, at 26, even though you haven't seemed like you've aged much since. Many people credit this as your first movie, but I knew better  I first noticed, and fell head over heels for you, in the atrocious Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Waitoh, that's why you want people to believe this is your first role. Good call. Side Note II: As many lines in this I still quote today, this was my first introduction to the phrase "A Friend of Dorothy," which means, um, "Not a Fan of Hustler." I died laughing hearing that for the first time, even though it was obvious to whom they were referring to as such in the movie. Maybe, Cher was, in fact, Clueless. Um. Maybe?

The last thing we want are girls growing up and watching this and saying "hey, going to parties, getting drunk, smoking weed (among other things) is a perfect way to become popular and find my soul mate!" Really. REALLY? People actually enjoy this dribble? But I digress, just never ever see this film. While nothing is graphic or done strongly, the morals and messages that this film conveys are entirely too stupid to be believable, and I don't care if she changes her heart or becomes a better person or whatever. Only a simpleton would live like Cher, much less like this film. It belongs in the 1990's garbage bin.

    As ifyou haven't seen this 1990s classic, you should now. Back in the mid to upper 1990s, I first saw Clueless and as much as I laughed hard and thoroughly enjoyed it, I knew right then, as fresh as it was, it was going to be a dated movie. Fast forward 18 years, and it's  totally!  still enjoyable, but I agree with my original thought. So, I can see someone saying that it's dated nowadays, especially kids, or anyone that missed it back then. Luckily, I caught it new and still love it just as much. Normally, I hate to be around or watch either bimbos or mimbos, but I had a feeling this movie wasn't glorifying them; instead, they were severely mocking them. But, when the very talented (at least for this role) Alicia Silverstone can play someone with less than half a brain and selfish and yet, contains a full heart, I admire the movie  and her performance  even more. Totally Valley Cher (Silverstone) and her pal, Dionne, spend their time: using up their rich family's money by incessantly shopping, grouping fellow high school kids into segregations and occasionally caring about "the lesser and unfortunate" people, which, in real life, have more going for them than 3 of both Cher and Dionne combined. But, this is a slapstick kind of comedy, so let's try not to get too deep. The first half of the movie is just one example after the next of perky Cher and her high zest in life and an actual "second movie" appears when the ultrathin plot is revealed: Cher's outward appearance doesn't match her insides. She wants companionship and the movie tries to convey that with little success, but enough to give the movie a slight spark of a conflict. It's the second half where the film, unfortunately, loses a little steam and overstays its welcome a bit. All of that doesn't matter; Clueless is not really just that. In a lot of ways, it's brilliant, absolutely hilarious, contains fantastic secondary characters and has both some enormously quotable lines and very funny scenes. Not to mention, the incredible soundtrack that I recall buying immediately following my first viewing. While I like practically every song on the album, Kids in America, the opening title song to the motion picture, is one of my all time movie favorite songs. Since I was part of the pack that saw this before it became pass&eacute;, I believe it still holds up today and it was great to revisit a lot of the scenes, lines and songs I grew up loving. See it, gurl! Side Note: Oh, and Paul (Rudd): I had a huge crush on you back then, and still today. You look so young here, at 26, even though you haven't seemed like you've aged much since. Many people credit this as your first movie, but I knew better  I first noticed, and fell head over heels for you, in the atrocious Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Waitoh, that's why you want people to believe this is your first role. Good call. Side Note II: As many lines in this I still quote today, this was my first introduction to the phrase "A Friend of Dorothy," which means, um, "Not a Fan of Hustler." I died laughing hearing that for the first time, even though it was obvious to whom they were referring to as such in the movie. Maybe, Cher was, in fact, Clueless. Um. Maybe?

    Clueless is a fantastic movie with a good story line,which is a common teen movie story,but the movies comedic cast and hilarious characters make it more fun for all ages.Alicia Silverstone plays the lead character,she is very funny in the movie and also extremely attractive.My favourite part of the movie is Paul Rudd's character Josh,I have never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like,and his characters are always very funny and down to earth,like I imagine he is.I think the whole family can enjoy this movie and I was extremely surprised with how much I enjoyed it. Cher (Alicia Silverstone) lives a high-profile life living with her rich father,and spends most of her time with her friends and putting people together,but Cher realises its time for her to find a boyfriend of her own.

    "Clueless" is one of the classic teen movies from the 1990s. It is feel-good, hilarious and witty. A majority of teen movies tend to involve exaggerated characters, grotesque behaviour and bland dialogues. Not this one. The lead female character, Cher, is spoilt, arrogant, manipulative, good-looking, fashion-obsessed and a daughter of a rich lawyer. Her attempts to help the others improve their personal lives are either motived by her selfish interests or are helpful distractions from her own loneliness, which is mainly a side-effect of her arrogance. Despite all that, her character is in fact very likable, simply because there is no real malice in anything that she does. Plus, she is a genuinely caring daughter. Even her needling jokes at the expense of her a couple of years' older ex step-brother are in fact relatively benign reactions to his unjustifiably stereotypical opinion of her. The other characters are very entertaining and tend to end up looking a lot deeper than what a viewer might think of them when they are first introduced. This is actually quite a refreshing trait of this film. Anyway, what really sets this movie apart from much of the rest of the genre is an abundance of witty retorts. This is what makes you not feel like you can hardly wait for the predictable ending. In sum, "Clueless" is one of the very few movies from the teen comedy genre that I cannot fault.

    Clueless is about a sweet rich girl who is totally clueless about most things in life except for shopping. It sounds terrible, but actually, it's presented in an adorable way. You get attached to the main character very quickly and root her efforts to make the world a better place. It's all setup in the world of the very rich, yet you can't help yourself. Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd have excellent chemistry and are giving us very good acting. The rest of the ensemble is of lesser value, but nothing to detract our attention. The story is simple, elegant, and nice to embark upon. The only thing that I have to pick at? The phones are getting old. And that hat! (You'll see what I mean.) See it, it's sweet.

    Clueless is a romantic comedy about a group of extremely wealthy teens in Beverly Hills. Cher's (Alicia Silverstone) life revolves around clothes, boys and basically just getting whatever she wants. She can talk her way into or out of anything. Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) decide to make the new girl, Tai (Brittany Murphy), their project and make her as popular as they are. Soon Cher realizes she is the one who actually needs a makeover; only she needs to makeover her soul. She emerges a more caring less clueless individual and finally has found herself that Baldwin she was looking for too. This movie is a great coming of age film about a girl finally realizing that there are more things to life than shopping. Throughout the movie we get to watch and laugh as Cher develops into a far less clueless being than she was, although still pretty clueless. She matures as a character just as the kids of The Breakfast Club do. She actually reminds me of a modern Claire. The story line of the movies while different definitely has some similarities as well. The characters all realize that who you hang out with and where you come from are not as important as the person inside. Cher as well as The Breakfast Club all come out of their experience more mature and with some new great friends. There is a scene where the camera zooms in on Cher as she is thinking of what everyone else does to contribute to the world. It gets in close so that you can her expression and that she truly wants to better herself. Then she says that she wants to help. She decides to head up the disaster relief campaign. I also think it shows a great enlightening moment for her when she is walking and she figures out that she loves Josh (Paul Rudd). All the lights from the fountain that light up behind her and then the music plays with the trumpets right before she looks into the camera. It really pulls you into the scene and makes you feel like it is a magical discovery that has hit her to her core. It changes her entire demeanor around him after this moment too. She gets fidgety and nervous. I think this scene is one of the turning points in Cher maturing as a character. I think this film was a great way to combine a coming of age film with a comedy instead of just a regular drama. You got to watch Cher grow as an individual and get some laughs on the way. I think this movie is an overall good viewing experience.

    I thought this was a wonderful teen h.s. movie.. yeah it's a lot of over the top material sure and some of the stuff that happens in the movie i'm sure actually goes on at high school. I thought that Ms. Silverstone did a really wonderful job with this and should have picked up at least a few awards for her work in the movie. she's funny intelligent, witty, and of course super sexy.. I liked all the different characters in the movie,, it made you kinda sorta wanna care about them in a way... Cher our character has many issues in this movie,, trying to take care of her dad,, finding a boyfriend,, playing miss i'm gonna save the world,, being the most popular girl at school,, doing makeover's for her friends and the like,, all in all I thought that this was a wonderful movie to watch.

    Clueless is almost a film about nothing. We follow the story of sixteen-year-old schoolgirl Cher who is popular, rich and beautiful, and has everybody around her at her fingertips. She's manipulative, selfish and a snob who seems to only have one other high school friend Dionne. Yet despite her major flaws that would generally have the audience hating her, we don't. Cher comes through as a character we really adore and care about due to one major reason, her childish innocence or as the title of the movie puts it her cluelessness. The general synopsis of the film follows Cher (Alicia Silverstone) as she attempts to con and manipulate her teachers into increasing her low grades. A feat her lawyer father encourages and praises her for. She soon gets a taste for meddling into peoples lives and takes in upon herself to give a new girl at the school Tai (Britney Murphy) a makeover and spring her into popularity. Much of the story then follows her naivety in controlling other people and the dynamics of her friendships with a loose love story coming into play towards the end. Despite the weak plot much of what makes Clueless work well as a film is the subtle humor and innocently naive characters you grow to appreciate. It's the film that propelled Alicia Silverstone into the Hollywood spotlight, and of course was also the late Britney Murphy's break through role. It's a high school movie classic that will cause you to laugh out loud many times and a must see for the 90s nostalgia. If you really enjoy the movie check out the 90s follow up TV series of Clueless which see's much of the cast from the movie reunited minus Miss Silverstone.

    Well, after nearly 20 years of only seeing certain scenes in this movie (I was working as an usher when this came out and snuck in some movie-watching time in between shows), I finally watched the whole thing with my mom just now on Netflix disc. In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.

    OK, I know. I'm deliriously in love with Alicia Silverstone. And I know she's already married. A perfectly written film, also directed by Amy Heckerling. The trials and tribulations of affluent high school kids includes Alicia's quest to 'make-over' her heart and soul. Her flawless comedic talent is accompanied by other attractive actors such as Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash, and Justin Walker. Lots of fun for the more mature folks in the audience as well as the younger crowd. Choice music enlivens the soundtrack. Now to more important things..... Alicia, will you marry me?! :)

    This is yet again another trashy adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma. It features downright stupid performances and writing featuring a story that is, even with its "clever" spin on it, clich&eacute; and downright 90's. It's incredible how terrible this film has aged, as there is purely not one thing that made me laugh, care, or interested. Actually, Clueless is just that. It is an emotionless smorgasbord of annoying ideas and teen angst that would be better left never considered and crafted into a film. A film is where we can explore the imagination of the director, experience convincing emotional reward from the cast, and be transported to a different world. Clueless is completely the opposite. The characters are stupid, contrived, silly, and downright unlikeable. There's no artistic value in any of the shots, as it is stuck in that weird 90's limbo of "hey, the 90's are great, let's include everything that we think is great about the 90's in this film." Yeah, that will work, but nearly 20 years later and this film is just plain ugly and gross to look at. Plus, all of the drug and teen partying content is nasty. The last thing we want are girls growing up and watching this and saying "hey, going to parties, getting drunk, smoking weed (among other things) is a perfect way to become popular and find my soul mate!" Really. REALLY? People actually enjoy this dribble? But I digress, just never ever see this film. While nothing is graphic or done strongly, the morals and messages that this film conveys are entirely too stupid to be believable, and I don't care if she changes her heart or becomes a better person or whatever. Only a simpleton would live like Cher, much less like this film. It belongs in the 1990's garbage bin.

In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.

    OK, I know. I'm deliriously in love with Alicia Silverstone. And I know she's already married. A perfectly written film, also directed by Amy Heckerling. The trials and tribulations of affluent high school kids includes Alicia's quest to 'make-over' her heart and soul. Her flawless comedic talent is accompanied by other attractive actors such as Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash, and Justin Walker. Lots of fun for the more mature folks in the audience as well as the younger crowd. Choice music enlivens the soundtrack. Now to more important things..... Alicia, will you marry me?! :)

    This is yet again another trashy adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma. It features downright stupid performances and writing featuring a story that is, even with its "clever" spin on it, clich&eacute; and downright 90's. It's incredible how terrible this film has aged, as there is purely not one thing that made me laugh, care, or interested. Actually, Clueless is just that. It is an emotionless smorgasbord of annoying ideas and teen angst that would be better left never considered and crafted into a film. A film is where we can explore the imagination of the director, experience convincing emotional reward from the cast, and be transported to a different world. Clueless is completely the opposite. The characters are stupid, contrived, silly, and downright unlikeable. There's no artistic value in any of the shots, as it is stuck in that weird 90's limbo of "hey, the 90's are great, let's include everything that we think is great about the 90's in this film." Yeah, that will work, but nearly 20 years later and this film is just plain ugly and gross to look at. Plus, all of the drug and teen partying content is nasty. The last thing we want are girls growing up and watching this and saying "hey, going to parties, getting drunk, smoking weed (among other things) is a perfect way to become popular and find my soul mate!" Really. REALLY? People actually enjoy this dribble? But I digress, just never ever see this film. While nothing is graphic or done strongly, the morals and messages that this film conveys are entirely too stupid to be believable, and I don't care if she changes her heart or becomes a better person or whatever. Only a simpleton would live like Cher, much less like this film. It belongs in the 1990's garbage bin.

    As ifyou haven't seen this 1990s classic, you should now. Back in the mid to upper 1990s, I first saw Clueless and as much as I laughed hard and thoroughly enjoyed it, I knew right then, as fresh as it was, it was going to be a dated movie. Fast forward 18 years, and it's  totally!  still enjoyable, but I agree with my original thought. So, I can see someone saying that it's dated nowadays, especially kids, or anyone that missed it back then. Luckily, I caught it new and still love it just as much. Normally, I hate to be around or watch either bimbos or mimbos, but I had a feeling this movie wasn't glorifying them; instead, they were severely mocking them. But, when the very talented (at least for this role) Alicia Silverstone can play someone with less than half a brain and selfish and yet, contains a full heart, I admire the movie  and her performance  even more. Totally Valley Cher (Silverstone) and her pal, Dionne, spend their time: using up their rich family's money by incessantly shopping, grouping fellow high school kids into segregations and occasionally caring about "the lesser and unfortunate" people, which, in real life, have more going for them than 3 of both Cher and Dionne combined. But, this is a slapstick kind of comedy, so let's try not to get too deep. The first half of the movie is just one example after the next of perky Cher and her high zest in life and an actual "second movie" appears when the ultrathin plot is revealed: Cher's outward appearance doesn't match her insides. She wants companionship and the movie tries to convey that with little success, but enough to give the movie a slight spark of a conflict. It's the second half where the film, unfortunately, loses a little steam and overstays its welcome a bit. All of that doesn't matter; Clueless is not really just that. In a lot of ways, it's brilliant, absolutely hilarious, contains fantastic secondary characters and has both some enormously quotable lines and very funny scenes. Not to mention, the incredible soundtrack that I recall buying immediately following my first viewing. While I like practically every song on the album, Kids in America, the opening title song to the motion picture, is one of my all time movie favorite songs. Since I was part of the pack that saw this before it became pass&eacute;, I believe it still holds up today and it was great to revisit a lot of the scenes, lines and songs I grew up loving. See it, gurl! Side Note: Oh, and Paul (Rudd): I had a huge crush on you back then, and still today. You look so young here, at 26, even though you haven't seemed like you've aged much since. Many people credit this as your first movie, but I knew better  I first noticed, and fell head over heels for you, in the atrocious Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Waitoh, that's why you want people to believe this is your first role. Good call. Side Note II: As many lines in this I still quote today, this was my first introduction to the phrase "A Friend of Dorothy," which means, um, "Not a Fan of Hustler." I died laughing hearing that for the first time, even though it was obvious to whom they were referring to as such in the movie. Maybe, Cher was, in fact, Clueless. Um. Maybe?

    Clueless is a fantastic movie with a good story line,which is a common teen movie story,but the movies comedic cast and hilarious characters make it more fun for all ages.Alicia Silverstone plays the lead character,she is very funny in the movie and also extremely attractive.My favourite part of the movie is Paul Rudd's character Josh,I have never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like,and his characters are always very funny and down to earth,like I imagine he is.I think the whole family can enjoy this movie and I was extremely surprised with how much I enjoyed it. Cher (Alicia Silverstone) lives a high-profile life living with her rich father,and spends most of her time with her friends and putting people together,but Cher realises its time for her to find a boyfriend of her own.

    "Clueless" is one of the classic teen movies from the 1990s. It is feel-good, hilarious and witty. A majority of teen movies tend to involve exaggerated characters, grotesque behaviour and bland dialogues. Not this one. The lead female character, Cher, is spoilt, arrogant, manipulative, good-looking, fashion-obsessed and a daughter of a rich lawyer. Her attempts to help the others improve their personal lives are either motived by her selfish interests or are helpful distractions from her own loneliness, which is mainly a side-effect of her arrogance. Despite all that, her character is in fact very likable, simply because there is no real malice in anything that she does. Plus, she is a genuinely caring daughter. Even her needling jokes at the expense of her a couple of years' older ex step-brother are in fact relatively benign reactions to his unjustifiably stereotypical opinion of her. The other characters are very entertaining and tend to end up looking a lot deeper than what a viewer might think of them when they are first introduced. This is actually quite a refreshing trait of this film. Anyway, what really sets this movie apart from much of the rest of the genre is an abundance of witty retorts. This is what makes you not feel like you can hardly wait for the predictable ending. In sum, "Clueless" is one of the very few movies from the teen comedy genre that I cannot fault.

    Clueless is about a sweet rich girl who is totally clueless about most things in life except for shopping. It sounds terrible, but actually, it's presented in an adorable way. You get attached to the main character very quickly and root her efforts to make the world a better place. It's all setup in the world of the very rich, yet you can't help yourself. Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd have excellent chemistry and are giving us very good acting. The rest of the ensemble is of lesser value, but nothing to detract our attention. The story is simple, elegant, and nice to embark upon. The only thing that I have to pick at? The phones are getting old. And that hat! (You'll see what I mean.) See it, it's sweet.

    Clueless is a romantic comedy about a group of extremely wealthy teens in Beverly Hills. Cher's (Alicia Silverstone) life revolves around clothes, boys and basically just getting whatever she wants. She can talk her way into or out of anything. Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) decide to make the new girl, Tai (Brittany Murphy), their project and make her as popular as they are. Soon Cher realizes she is the one who actually needs a makeover; only she needs to makeover her soul. She emerges a more caring less clueless individual and finally has found herself that Baldwin she was looking for too. This movie is a great coming of age film about a girl finally realizing that there are more things to life than shopping. Throughout the movie we get to watch and laugh as Cher develops into a far less clueless being than she was, although still pretty clueless. She matures as a character just as the kids of The Breakfast Club do. She actually reminds me of a modern Claire. The story line of the movies while different definitely has some similarities as well. The characters all realize that who you hang out with and where you come from are not as important as the person inside. Cher as well as The Breakfast Club all come out of their experience more mature and with some new great friends. There is a scene where the camera zooms in on Cher as she is thinking of what everyone else does to contribute to the world. It gets in close so that you can her expression and that she truly wants to better herself. Then she says that she wants to help. She decides to head up the disaster relief campaign. I also think it shows a great enlightening moment for her when she is walking and she figures out that she loves Josh (Paul Rudd). All the lights from the fountain that light up behind her and then the music plays with the trumpets right before she looks into the camera. It really pulls you into the scene and makes you feel like it is a magical discovery that has hit her to her core. It changes her entire demeanor around him after this moment too. She gets fidgety and nervous. I think this scene is one of the turning points in Cher maturing as a character. I think this film was a great way to combine a coming of age film with a comedy instead of just a regular drama. You got to watch Cher grow as an individual and get some laughs on the way. I think this movie is an overall good viewing experience.

    I thought this was a wonderful teen h.s. movie.. yeah it's a lot of over the top material sure and some of the stuff that happens in the movie i'm sure actually goes on at high school. I thought that Ms. Silverstone did a really wonderful job with this and should have picked up at least a few awards for her work in the movie. she's funny intelligent, witty, and of course super sexy.. I liked all the different characters in the movie,, it made you kinda sorta wanna care about them in a way... Cher our character has many issues in this movie,, trying to take care of her dad,, finding a boyfriend,, playing miss i'm gonna save the world,, being the most popular girl at school,, doing makeover's for her friends and the like,, all in all I thought that this was a wonderful movie to watch.

    Clueless is almost a film about nothing. We follow the story of sixteen-year-old schoolgirl Cher who is popular, rich and beautiful, and has everybody around her at her fingertips. She's manipulative, selfish and a snob who seems to only have one other high school friend Dionne. Yet despite her major flaws that would generally have the audience hating her, we don't. Cher comes through as a character we really adore and care about due to one major reason, her childish innocence or as the title of the movie puts it her cluelessness. The general synopsis of the film follows Cher (Alicia Silverstone) as she attempts to con and manipulate her teachers into increasing her low grades. A feat her lawyer father encourages and praises her for. She soon gets a taste for meddling into peoples lives and takes in upon herself to give a new girl at the school Tai (Britney Murphy) a makeover and spring her into popularity. Much of the story then follows her naivety in controlling other people and the dynamics of her friendships with a loose love story coming into play towards the end. Despite the weak plot much of what makes Clueless work well as a film is the subtle humor and innocently naive characters you grow to appreciate. It's the film that propelled Alicia Silverstone into the Hollywood spotlight, and of course was also the late Britney Murphy's break through role. It's a high school movie classic that will cause you to laugh out loud many times and a must see for the 90s nostalgia. If you really enjoy the movie check out the 90s follow up TV series of Clueless which see's much of the cast from the movie reunited minus Miss Silverstone.

    Well, after nearly 20 years of only seeing certain scenes in this movie (I was working as an usher when this came out and snuck in some movie-watching time in between shows), I finally watched the whole thing with my mom just now on Netflix disc. In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.

I thought that Ms. Silverstone did a really wonderful job with this and should have picked up at least a few awards for her work in the movie. she's funny intelligent, witty, and of course super sexy.. I liked all the different characters in the movie,, it made you kinda sorta wanna care about them in a way... Cher our character has many issues in this movie,, trying to take care of her dad,, finding a boyfriend,, playing miss i'm gonna save the world,, being the most popular girl at school,, doing makeover's for her friends and the like,, all in all I thought that this was a wonderful movie to watch.

    Clueless is almost a film about nothing. We follow the story of sixteen-year-old schoolgirl Cher who is popular, rich and beautiful, and has everybody around her at her fingertips. She's manipulative, selfish and a snob who seems to only have one other high school friend Dionne. Yet despite her major flaws that would generally have the audience hating her, we don't. Cher comes through as a character we really adore and care about due to one major reason, her childish innocence or as the title of the movie puts it her cluelessness. The general synopsis of the film follows Cher (Alicia Silverstone) as she attempts to con and manipulate her teachers into increasing her low grades. A feat her lawyer father encourages and praises her for. She soon gets a taste for meddling into peoples lives and takes in upon herself to give a new girl at the school Tai (Britney Murphy) a makeover and spring her into popularity. Much of the story then follows her naivety in controlling other people and the dynamics of her friendships with a loose love story coming into play towards the end. Despite the weak plot much of what makes Clueless work well as a film is the subtle humor and innocently naive characters you grow to appreciate. It's the film that propelled Alicia Silverstone into the Hollywood spotlight, and of course was also the late Britney Murphy's break through role. It's a high school movie classic that will cause you to laugh out loud many times and a must see for the 90s nostalgia. If you really enjoy the movie check out the 90s follow up TV series of Clueless which see's much of the cast from the movie reunited minus Miss Silverstone.

    Well, after nearly 20 years of only seeing certain scenes in this movie (I was working as an usher when this came out and snuck in some movie-watching time in between shows), I finally watched the whole thing with my mom just now on Netflix disc. In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.

    OK, I know. I'm deliriously in love with Alicia Silverstone. And I know she's already married. A perfectly written film, also directed by Amy Heckerling. The trials and tribulations of affluent high school kids includes Alicia's quest to 'make-over' her heart and soul. Her flawless comedic talent is accompanied by other attractive actors such as Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash, and Justin Walker. Lots of fun for the more mature folks in the audience as well as the younger crowd. Choice music enlivens the soundtrack. Now to more important things..... Alicia, will you marry me?! :)

    This is yet again another trashy adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma. It features downright stupid performances and writing featuring a story that is, even with its "clever" spin on it, clich&eacute; and downright 90's. It's incredible how terrible this film has aged, as there is purely not one thing that made me laugh, care, or interested. Actually, Clueless is just that. It is an emotionless smorgasbord of annoying ideas and teen angst that would be better left never considered and crafted into a film. A film is where we can explore the imagination of the director, experience convincing emotional reward from the cast, and be transported to a different world. Clueless is completely the opposite. The characters are stupid, contrived, silly, and downright unlikeable. There's no artistic value in any of the shots, as it is stuck in that weird 90's limbo of "hey, the 90's are great, let's include everything that we think is great about the 90's in this film." Yeah, that will work, but nearly 20 years later and this film is just plain ugly and gross to look at. Plus, all of the drug and teen partying content is nasty. The last thing we want are girls growing up and watching this and saying "hey, going to parties, getting drunk, smoking weed (among other things) is a perfect way to become popular and find my soul mate!" Really. REALLY? People actually enjoy this dribble? But I digress, just never ever see this film. While nothing is graphic or done strongly, the morals and messages that this film conveys are entirely too stupid to be believable, and I don't care if she changes her heart or becomes a better person or whatever. Only a simpleton would live like Cher, much less like this film. It belongs in the 1990's garbage bin.

    As ifyou haven't seen this 1990s classic, you should now. Back in the mid to upper 1990s, I first saw Clueless and as much as I laughed hard and thoroughly enjoyed it, I knew right then, as fresh as it was, it was going to be a dated movie. Fast forward 18 years, and it's  totally!  still enjoyable, but I agree with my original thought. So, I can see someone saying that it's dated nowadays, especially kids, or anyone that missed it back then. Luckily, I caught it new and still love it just as much. Normally, I hate to be around or watch either bimbos or mimbos, but I had a feeling this movie wasn't glorifying them; instead, they were severely mocking them. But, when the very talented (at least for this role) Alicia Silverstone can play someone with less than half a brain and selfish and yet, contains a full heart, I admire the movie  and her performance  even more. Totally Valley Cher (Silverstone) and her pal, Dionne, spend their time: using up their rich family's money by incessantly shopping, grouping fellow high school kids into segregations and occasionally caring about "the lesser and unfortunate" people, which, in real life, have more going for them than 3 of both Cher and Dionne combined. But, this is a slapstick kind of comedy, so let's try not to get too deep. The first half of the movie is just one example after the next of perky Cher and her high zest in life and an actual "second movie" appears when the ultrathin plot is revealed: Cher's outward appearance doesn't match her insides. She wants companionship and the movie tries to convey that with little success, but enough to give the movie a slight spark of a conflict. It's the second half where the film, unfortunately, loses a little steam and overstays its welcome a bit. All of that doesn't matter; Clueless is not really just that. In a lot of ways, it's brilliant, absolutely hilarious, contains fantastic secondary characters and has both some enormously quotable lines and very funny scenes. Not to mention, the incredible soundtrack that I recall buying immediately following my first viewing. While I like practically every song on the album, Kids in America, the opening title song to the motion picture, is one of my all time movie favorite songs. Since I was part of the pack that saw this before it became pass&eacute;, I believe it still holds up today and it was great to revisit a lot of the scenes, lines and songs I grew up loving. See it, gurl! Side Note: Oh, and Paul (Rudd): I had a huge crush on you back then, and still today. You look so young here, at 26, even though you haven't seemed like you've aged much since. Many people credit this as your first movie, but I knew better  I first noticed, and fell head over heels for you, in the atrocious Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Waitoh, that's why you want people to believe this is your first role. Good call. Side Note II: As many lines in this I still quote today, this was my first introduction to the phrase "A Friend of Dorothy," which means, um, "Not a Fan of Hustler." I died laughing hearing that for the first time, even though it was obvious to whom they were referring to as such in the movie. Maybe, Cher was, in fact, Clueless. Um. Maybe?

    Clueless is a fantastic movie with a good story line,which is a common teen movie story,but the movies comedic cast and hilarious characters make it more fun for all ages.Alicia Silverstone plays the lead character,she is very funny in the movie and also extremely attractive.My favourite part of the movie is Paul Rudd's character Josh,I have never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like,and his characters are always very funny and down to earth,like I imagine he is.I think the whole family can enjoy this movie and I was extremely surprised with how much I enjoyed it. Cher (Alicia Silverstone) lives a high-profile life living with her rich father,and spends most of her time with her friends and putting people together,but Cher realises its time for her to find a boyfriend of her own.

    "Clueless" is one of the classic teen movies from the 1990s. It is feel-good, hilarious and witty. A majority of teen movies tend to involve exaggerated characters, grotesque behaviour and bland dialogues. Not this one. The lead female character, Cher, is spoilt, arrogant, manipulative, good-looking, fashion-obsessed and a daughter of a rich lawyer. Her attempts to help the others improve their personal lives are either motived by her selfish interests or are helpful distractions from her own loneliness, which is mainly a side-effect of her arrogance. Despite all that, her character is in fact very likable, simply because there is no real malice in anything that she does. Plus, she is a genuinely caring daughter. Even her needling jokes at the expense of her a couple of years' older ex step-brother are in fact relatively benign reactions to his unjustifiably stereotypical opinion of her. The other characters are very entertaining and tend to end up looking a lot deeper than what a viewer might think of them when they are first introduced. This is actually quite a refreshing trait of this film. Anyway, what really sets this movie apart from much of the rest of the genre is an abundance of witty retorts. This is what makes you not feel like you can hardly wait for the predictable ending. In sum, "Clueless" is one of the very few movies from the teen comedy genre that I cannot fault.

    Clueless is about a sweet rich girl who is totally clueless about most things in life except for shopping. It sounds terrible, but actually, it's presented in an adorable way. You get attached to the main character very quickly and root her efforts to make the world a better place. It's all setup in the world of the very rich, yet you can't help yourself. Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd have excellent chemistry and are giving us very good acting. The rest of the ensemble is of lesser value, but nothing to detract our attention. The story is simple, elegant, and nice to embark upon. The only thing that I have to pick at? The phones are getting old. And that hat! (You'll see what I mean.) See it, it's sweet.

    Clueless is a romantic comedy about a group of extremely wealthy teens in Beverly Hills. Cher's (Alicia Silverstone) life revolves around clothes, boys and basically just getting whatever she wants. She can talk her way into or out of anything. Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) decide to make the new girl, Tai (Brittany Murphy), their project and make her as popular as they are. Soon Cher realizes she is the one who actually needs a makeover; only she needs to makeover her soul. She emerges a more caring less clueless individual and finally has found herself that Baldwin she was looking for too. This movie is a great coming of age film about a girl finally realizing that there are more things to life than shopping. Throughout the movie we get to watch and laugh as Cher develops into a far less clueless being than she was, although still pretty clueless. She matures as a character just as the kids of The Breakfast Club do. She actually reminds me of a modern Claire. The story line of the movies while different definitely has some similarities as well. The characters all realize that who you hang out with and where you come from are not as important as the person inside. Cher as well as The Breakfast Club all come out of their experience more mature and with some new great friends. There is a scene where the camera zooms in on Cher as she is thinking of what everyone else does to contribute to the world. It gets in close so that you can her expression and that she truly wants to better herself. Then she says that she wants to help. She decides to head up the disaster relief campaign. I also think it shows a great enlightening moment for her when she is walking and she figures out that she loves Josh (Paul Rudd). All the lights from the fountain that light up behind her and then the music plays with the trumpets right before she looks into the camera. It really pulls you into the scene and makes you feel like it is a magical discovery that has hit her to her core. It changes her entire demeanor around him after this moment too. She gets fidgety and nervous. I think this scene is one of the turning points in Cher maturing as a character. I think this film was a great way to combine a coming of age film with a comedy instead of just a regular drama. You got to watch Cher grow as an individual and get some laughs on the way. I think this movie is an overall good viewing experience.

    Clueless is a romantic comedy about a group of extremely wealthy teens in Beverly Hills. Cher's (Alicia Silverstone) life revolves around clothes, boys and basically just getting whatever she wants. She can talk her way into or out of anything. Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) decide to make the new girl, Tai (Brittany Murphy), their project and make her as popular as they are. Soon Cher realizes she is the one who actually needs a makeover; only she needs to makeover her soul. She emerges a more caring less clueless individual and finally has found herself that Baldwin she was looking for too. This movie is a great coming of age film about a girl finally realizing that there are more things to life than shopping. Throughout the movie we get to watch and laugh as Cher develops into a far less clueless being than she was, although still pretty clueless. She matures as a character just as the kids of The Breakfast Club do. She actually reminds me of a modern Claire. The story line of the movies while different definitely has some similarities as well. The characters all realize that who you hang out with and where you come from are not as important as the person inside. Cher as well as The Breakfast Club all come out of their experience more mature and with some new great friends. There is a scene where the camera zooms in on Cher as she is thinking of what everyone else does to contribute to the world. It gets in close so that you can her expression and that she truly wants to better herself. Then she says that she wants to help. She decides to head up the disaster relief campaign. I also think it shows a great enlightening moment for her when she is walking and she figures out that she loves Josh (Paul Rudd). All the lights from the fountain that light up behind her and then the music plays with the trumpets right before she looks into the camera. It really pulls you into the scene and makes you feel like it is a magical discovery that has hit her to her core. It changes her entire demeanor around him after this moment too. She gets fidgety and nervous. I think this scene is one of the turning points in Cher maturing as a character. I think this film was a great way to combine a coming of age film with a comedy instead of just a regular drama. You got to watch Cher grow as an individual and get some laughs on the way. I think this movie is an overall good viewing experience.

    I thought this was a wonderful teen h.s. movie.. yeah it's a lot of over the top material sure and some of the stuff that happens in the movie i'm sure actually goes on at high school. I thought that Ms. Silverstone did a really wonderful job with this and should have picked up at least a few awards for her work in the movie. she's funny intelligent, witty, and of course super sexy.. I liked all the different characters in the movie,, it made you kinda sorta wanna care about them in a way... Cher our character has many issues in this movie,, trying to take care of her dad,, finding a boyfriend,, playing miss i'm gonna save the world,, being the most popular girl at school,, doing makeover's for her friends and the like,, all in all I thought that this was a wonderful movie to watch.

    Clueless is almost a film about nothing. We follow the story of sixteen-year-old schoolgirl Cher who is popular, rich and beautiful, and has everybody around her at her fingertips. She's manipulative, selfish and a snob who seems to only have one other high school friend Dionne. Yet despite her major flaws that would generally have the audience hating her, we don't. Cher comes through as a character we really adore and care about due to one major reason, her childish innocence or as the title of the movie puts it her cluelessness. The general synopsis of the film follows Cher (Alicia Silverstone) as she attempts to con and manipulate her teachers into increasing her low grades. A feat her lawyer father encourages and praises her for. She soon gets a taste for meddling into peoples lives and takes in upon herself to give a new girl at the school Tai (Britney Murphy) a makeover and spring her into popularity. Much of the story then follows her naivety in controlling other people and the dynamics of her friendships with a loose love story coming into play towards the end. Despite the weak plot much of what makes Clueless work well as a film is the subtle humor and innocently naive characters you grow to appreciate. It's the film that propelled Alicia Silverstone into the Hollywood spotlight, and of course was also the late Britney Murphy's break through role. It's a high school movie classic that will cause you to laugh out loud many times and a must see for the 90s nostalgia. If you really enjoy the movie check out the 90s follow up TV series of Clueless which see's much of the cast from the movie reunited minus Miss Silverstone.

    Well, after nearly 20 years of only seeing certain scenes in this movie (I was working as an usher when this came out and snuck in some movie-watching time in between shows), I finally watched the whole thing with my mom just now on Netflix disc. In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.

    OK, I know. I'm deliriously in love with Alicia Silverstone. And I know she's already married. A perfectly written film, also directed by Amy Heckerling. The trials and tribulations of affluent high school kids includes Alicia's quest to 'make-over' her heart and soul. Her flawless comedic talent is accompanied by other attractive actors such as Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash, and Justin Walker. Lots of fun for the more mature folks in the audience as well as the younger crowd. Choice music enlivens the soundtrack. Now to more important things..... Alicia, will you marry me?! :)

    This is yet again another trashy adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma. It features downright stupid performances and writing featuring a story that is, even with its "clever" spin on it, clich&eacute; and downright 90's. It's incredible how terrible this film has aged, as there is purely not one thing that made me laugh, care, or interested. Actually, Clueless is just that. It is an emotionless smorgasbord of annoying ideas and teen angst that would be better left never considered and crafted into a film. A film is where we can explore the imagination of the director, experience convincing emotional reward from the cast, and be transported to a different world. Clueless is completely the opposite. The characters are stupid, contrived, silly, and downright unlikeable. There's no artistic value in any of the shots, as it is stuck in that weird 90's limbo of "hey, the 90's are great, let's include everything that we think is great about the 90's in this film." Yeah, that will work, but nearly 20 years later and this film is just plain ugly and gross to look at. Plus, all of the drug and teen partying content is nasty. The last thing we want are girls growing up and watching this and saying "hey, going to parties, getting drunk, smoking weed (among other things) is a perfect way to become popular and find my soul mate!" Really. REALLY? People actually enjoy this dribble? But I digress, just never ever see this film. While nothing is graphic or done strongly, the morals and messages that this film conveys are entirely too stupid to be believable, and I don't care if she changes her heart or becomes a better person or whatever. Only a simpleton would live like Cher, much less like this film. It belongs in the 1990's garbage bin.

    As ifyou haven't seen this 1990s classic, you should now. Back in the mid to upper 1990s, I first saw Clueless and as much as I laughed hard and thoroughly enjoyed it, I knew right then, as fresh as it was, it was going to be a dated movie. Fast forward 18 years, and it's  totally!  still enjoyable, but I agree with my original thought. So, I can see someone saying that it's dated nowadays, especially kids, or anyone that missed it back then. Luckily, I caught it new and still love it just as much. Normally, I hate to be around or watch either bimbos or mimbos, but I had a feeling this movie wasn't glorifying them; instead, they were severely mocking them. But, when the very talented (at least for this role) Alicia Silverstone can play someone with less than half a brain and selfish and yet, contains a full heart, I admire the movie  and her performance  even more. Totally Valley Cher (Silverstone) and her pal, Dionne, spend their time: using up their rich family's money by incessantly shopping, grouping fellow high school kids into segregations and occasionally caring about "the lesser and unfortunate" people, which, in real life, have more going for them than 3 of both Cher and Dionne combined. But, this is a slapstick kind of comedy, so let's try not to get too deep. The first half of the movie is just one example after the next of perky Cher and her high zest in life and an actual "second movie" appears when the ultrathin plot is revealed: Cher's outward appearance doesn't match her insides. She wants companionship and the movie tries to convey that with little success, but enough to give the movie a slight spark of a conflict. It's the second half where the film, unfortunately, loses a little steam and overstays its welcome a bit. All of that doesn't matter; Clueless is not really just that. In a lot of ways, it's brilliant, absolutely hilarious, contains fantastic secondary characters and has both some enormously quotable lines and very funny scenes. Not to mention, the incredible soundtrack that I recall buying immediately following my first viewing. While I like practically every song on the album, Kids in America, the opening title song to the motion picture, is one of my all time movie favorite songs. Since I was part of the pack that saw this before it became pass&eacute;, I believe it still holds up today and it was great to revisit a lot of the scenes, lines and songs I grew up loving. See it, gurl! Side Note: Oh, and Paul (Rudd): I had a huge crush on you back then, and still today. You look so young here, at 26, even though you haven't seemed like you've aged much since. Many people credit this as your first movie, but I knew better  I first noticed, and fell head over heels for you, in the atrocious Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Waitoh, that's why you want people to believe this is your first role. Good call. Side Note II: As many lines in this I still quote today, this was my first introduction to the phrase "A Friend of Dorothy," which means, um, "Not a Fan of Hustler." I died laughing hearing that for the first time, even though it was obvious to whom they were referring to as such in the movie. Maybe, Cher was, in fact, Clueless. Um. Maybe?

    Clueless is a fantastic movie with a good story line,which is a common teen movie story,but the movies comedic cast and hilarious characters make it more fun for all ages.Alicia Silverstone plays the lead character,she is very funny in the movie and also extremely attractive.My favourite part of the movie is Paul Rudd's character Josh,I have never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like,and his characters are always very funny and down to earth,like I imagine he is.I think the whole family can enjoy this movie and I was extremely surprised with how much I enjoyed it. Cher (Alicia Silverstone) lives a high-profile life living with her rich father,and spends most of her time with her friends and putting people together,but Cher realises its time for her to find a boyfriend of her own.

    "Clueless" is one of the classic teen movies from the 1990s. It is feel-good, hilarious and witty. A majority of teen movies tend to involve exaggerated characters, grotesque behaviour and bland dialogues. Not this one. The lead female character, Cher, is spoilt, arrogant, manipulative, good-looking, fashion-obsessed and a daughter of a rich lawyer. Her attempts to help the others improve their personal lives are either motived by her selfish interests or are helpful distractions from her own loneliness, which is mainly a side-effect of her arrogance. Despite all that, her character is in fact very likable, simply because there is no real malice in anything that she does. Plus, she is a genuinely caring daughter. Even her needling jokes at the expense of her a couple of years' older ex step-brother are in fact relatively benign reactions to his unjustifiably stereotypical opinion of her. The other characters are very entertaining and tend to end up looking a lot deeper than what a viewer might think of them when they are first introduced. This is actually quite a refreshing trait of this film. Anyway, what really sets this movie apart from much of the rest of the genre is an abundance of witty retorts. This is what makes you not feel like you can hardly wait for the predictable ending. In sum, "Clueless" is one of the very few movies from the teen comedy genre that I cannot fault.

    Clueless is about a sweet rich girl who is totally clueless about most things in life except for shopping. It sounds terrible, but actually, it's presented in an adorable way. You get attached to the main character very quickly and root her efforts to make the world a better place. It's all setup in the world of the very rich, yet you can't help yourself. Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd have excellent chemistry and are giving us very good acting. The rest of the ensemble is of lesser value, but nothing to detract our attention. The story is simple, elegant, and nice to embark upon. The only thing that I have to pick at? The phones are getting old. And that hat! (You'll see what I mean.) See it, it's sweet.
