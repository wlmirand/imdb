    A man's fear of heights lead to one woman falling off a church steeple, one woman purposely falling of the church steeple, and one man getting away with murder and stealing boat loads of money. But after I watched it the first time I said aloud, "What?" Vertigo, explicitly based off of The Living and the Dead by Bolieau-Narcjac, is based in San Francisco. To avoid spoilers, and make the movie sound interesting, a retired detective follows his lover all the way to death. But throughout the movie, it's a piece of deception, not just for the affected main character but also to the audience. You are literally blindsided at the end due to a "emotional shock" episode. But, don't get too comfortable when you watch the movie. There are moments of high suspense with extreme darkness and extreme light. There are also odd moments of excitement. Even with these odd moments, the ending is very abrupt. Even with the alternative ending, it didn't seemed fully complete. According to Turner Classic Movies, Hitchcock was never fully satisfied with the script. Three different writers re-wrote the movie till Hitchcock was the least dissatisfied. Odd moments like Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) leaving the psychiatric hospital talking to Scottie's (James Stewart) doctor and the "off" transition between her and the doctor was weird. After that, it was the last time we saw Midge. After Scottie left the hospital, it was never recognized again throughout the movie. Scottie's uncomfortably close watch of Madeline (Kim Novak.) Scottie's inquiries at Agory's Book Shop, the screen suddenly get dark, making you think the brightness on your device has had a lapse. Aside from scenes, looking at the film again, the foreshadowing is overwhelmingly obvious. Elster's (Tom Helmore) calm mode talking about his wife's, Madeline psychotic episodes, Madeline's whore-ish attitude toward Scottie, the cover of the film, and the unveiling of the deception two-thirds into the film. Even when Elster's wife jumped into the bay, her "husband" didn't care. The acting did a sure fire justice to screenplay.

    Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold. James Stewart is rather wooden in his role but is suitably matched by Kim Novak, whose pencilled eyebrows have more screen presence than the rest of her (not surprising given how huge they are!); Hitch must have been directing on Valium, such is the slowness of the pace; and the story is really mundane, with little in the way of excitement or suspense save for the opening rooftop chase scene. Quite what other Hitchcock fans are raving about when they claim this is amongst his best work is beyond meÂ—I struggled to stay awake.

    I've seen a total of 18 Hitchcock films since I started watching his films this year, and I've enjoyed all his works. I've been impressed with a good number of them, but after watching "Vertigo" for a 2nd time, I now believe this was Hitchcock's best work, and hence, his true masterpiece. The direction, the style, the story, the visuals, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the performances are all fantastic. I think it might be James Stewart's best performance out of all the films I've seen him in. Kim Novak also did a great job. Many Hitchcock films I've rated a 9/10, but in my opinion, this one deserves a 10/10! It's in my top ten favourite films of all time!

    This is probably the most divisive Hitchcock Movie. Dismissed in 1958 as unremarkable, slow, depressing, and was a Box-Office Flop, it is the more modern Viewers and Critics that now praise this as hypnotic, haunting, captivating, and deep. With some dissent it is Today considered one of the best Films ever, a Masterpiece, and definitive work of Art. Heaped with endless adulation and glowing, wordy essays, it is without doubt complex, meditative, and dreamlike in a way that is asking you to either fall for its impudent implications or not. The Film, in terms of Film Craft, contains impeccable Camera Work, a chilling Score, ethereal Color Schemes, some fine Acting and a Director who just might have bared His Soul for all to see becoming not the usual Voyeur but an Exhibionist. A flip flop of a Plot and Psychological maladies that are pure Hitchcockian. You could spend weeks reading up on the Film's nuances and find giddy Geek Writers wale endlessly on its meanings and double meanings, Doppelgangers and assorted dementia and neurosis. There are some who think this is dull, long, hammy, miscast, ridiculous, ludicrous, stiff, convoluted, and in the end not so much. But they would be in a very small minority. This is a Slow-Burner for sure, but beware, you might just get sucked into the Vortex, with its dizzying displays, morbid fascinations, and a nightmare ambiance.

    Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected-as I'm not the biggest fan of old movies- But not a great deal. I was rather confused throughout most the film. I did however like the story near more the beginning; the mystery around the whole madeleine character was rather intriguing, especially when the hotel housekeeper said she had not visited her room. I also liked how the audience saw the story threw Scotties eyes, not knowing about Judy until the flashback revealing everything. However I lost interest greatly when the flashback was shown as it answered the mystery of what was happening/happened to Madeleine (personally I would have kept the flashback till Scotty takes Judy to the tower) I think the Characters are a little boring, it took me a while to because interested and invested in the character, it did weird me out a bit when Scottie went a bit phyco and abusive towards Judy as he didn't seem to be that type of character up to that point. For the time it was made in I think the production values are very good, the only thing I thought was bad was whenever someone fell, it looked so bad but I could cope with it. I don't really think I would personally recommend it to my friends as it's not really a film they would be interested in. Nor do I think it's a film that really sticks out as memorable. For me personally I would not rate this in my top list of films. I would not class it in the worst films I've ever seen. It would probably be somewhere in the lower middle quarter. My main issue was it took too long to get into the main story line. I also don't understand why the nun scarred Judy so much, that was actually a little unrealistic. Although then again when I watched this alone I did get scared, but I mean if someone else was there I would not go slip off a building.

    Vertigo is like a roller-coaster. Not a good roller coaster, the type of roller coaster that takes half an hour to get up to the top and then when it finally gets to the first drop it starts to pick up speed before grinding to a sudden halt again. Vertigo was written by Alfred Hitchcock and released in theatres in 1958. The film is regarded as a classic and commonly seen as some of Hitchcock's best work, and honestly, after watching I can understand how people where able to come to this conclusion. The majority of the main cast is excellent, but the standout actor for me was certainly James Stewart plays our main character, John Ferguson, who deserves a large amount of praise for how convincingly he played his role throughout the film, as he changes from a sympathetic protagonist into a rather obsessive crazy psychopath driven by his grief throughout the film. The film overall has a very strong plot with numerous unpredictable twists throughout that I would not even dare spoil. However in many ways the movie's age shows. Nowhere is this clearer than in the dated special effects in the film and the incredibly cheesy soundtrack that many of the older Hitchcock films are known for. Personally I do not have a problem either of these, as I find these aspects add to the classic feeling of the film; however, I can see it putting off some potential viewers. The only problem I had with the film was, as I mentioned above, is the films pacing. The film starts incredibly slow and is rather boring for the first thirty minutes before it begins picking up pace, however it then grinds to a second halt later on after the courtroom scene for another half hour before it finally picks up again for the climax of the film. While I can certainly forgive this in some ways, since the film is very entertaining when it is going at a decent pace, I still felt that it was quite jarring at several points during the movie. Overall I did enjoy Vertigo lot despite some issues I had with the pacing, but even with that issue I still feel that the film is a very entertaining watch, due to its unpredictable plot and the strong performances delivered by the lead actors. It is due to this that I am willing to rate Vertigo as an 8/10.

    Vertigo was a film that was ahead of its time when it was released. Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there. Sure in 1958 this movie was full of suspense and thought provoking cinema however in this era it just seems dull and lacks the suspense needed to make it enjoyable. The fact this film is called a 'suspense thriller' is almost laughable. The film seems to meander around shots of walking and driving and stalking for a good 40 minutes, something which when the film didn't start that great in the first place doesn't help its cause. The storyline was fairly obvious as well, even for a simpleton like me to guess, in addition to the dull as ditch water dialogue (even at the time) that's teemed with it. The directing as I've mentioned is not to blame and the use of colours and sound are brilliant by Hitchcock but that cannot make up for Vertigo which promised so much and produced so very little on the big screen. I would recommend this film to Hitchcock fans but it is by no means his best film, not even close. The lack of suspense and boring storyline despite the cleverness of Hitchcock means this film has to have 5 stars

    Though I enjoyed this film I think at times it can be overrated by various critics and members of the public. I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not 'a timeless classic' as it is often called. The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending. The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending. Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard. Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.

    . . . and craven coward John "Scottie" Ferguson (played here by James Stewart, in perhaps the most reprehensible role during his long film career as the Tom Hanks of his day) sure as heck doesn't give two hoots about the woman he's tossing away like a used facial tissue, either. Nor does Judy-from-Kansas' previous sugar daddy, John's college chum Gavin, who has foisted her off upon John in an overly complicated plot to help himself to an ahead-of-its-time no-fault divorce. John, a completely amoral "whited sepulcher," has no qualms about putting it to Judy when she's masquerading as Gavin's troubled wife, Madeleine. But as soon as John realizes that he is NOT having kinky hand-me-down sex with Gavin's actual discarded spouse, he scrapes Judy out of his life like "Doggie Doo-Doo" on the bottom of his shoe, with the help of the Catholic Church in the guise of a nun who "thought she heard voices." The latter woman intones "God have mercy"--as surely no one on the Corrupt Coast ever had had when poor deluded Judy was still alive--to close out this overwrought "sex mystery" (to use director Alfred Hitchcock's later genre description of MARNIE). Judy\"Madeleine's" downfall was never realizing she was living among the morally bankrupt, and coming to grips with the fact that she definitely "was not in Kansas anymore"!

    Since nearly 600 people have already reviewed this film on IMDb, I was going to skip it. But, it's sucked me in, so here goes. First I have to say that I have a far different view of Hitchcock's career than do most. First, I don't like any of Hitchcock's pre-Hollywood films, and detest some of them (e.g., "Murder!"). Then, in 1940, with "Rebecca", he seems to break out of the British fog and the films are suddenly almost all terrific...if not brilliant (with a rare exception here and there; e.g., "Lifeboat". But then, suddenly, in 1960, for me it all falls apart with "Psycho". The film has some redeeming qualities in terms of scenes, but in general I don't see it as much more than a cheap slasher movie with a little more psychology tossed in. And "The Birds" is for the birds...cheap horror inspired by Rachel Carson's "A Silent Spring". I can sit through "Torn Curtain", but more due to the star quality than the film itself. In terms of "Vertigo", there seem to be two sticking points for many people. One is the age of Jimmy Stewart (50) and Kim Novak (25). First, this is similar in many pictures with many stars -- an older male star with a younger female star. The only place it ever really bothered me was with Gary Cooper (age 56) and Audrey Hepburn (age 28) in "Love In The Afternoon"; and then it was more about Cooper's haggard looks than the actual age difference. Here, Stewart is a rather young looking 50, and in my view, Novak plays a character more in her mid to later 30s, despite her real age. Consider the age of her husband in the film, the actor being 54 years old. The other catching point for some is the flashback scene about 1:40 into the film. Some think that the scene gives too much away, while others think it gives the film context. I watched for it in this, my third viewing of the film. I can take it either way, because in my view, in many films it's not where you're going that's as important as how you get there. A third thing sometimes criticized about the film is its length at 2:08. I don't see that as so long, and I rather like that Hitchcock lingered a bit with his scenes of San Francisco and some other locations. One thing I will criticize about many Hitchcock films is the cheapness of many of the scenes which he shot in front of a projection screen. It ruined "To Catch A Thief" for me, and is pretty bad in this film as well. Is this where he often tried to save money? Another thing about this film that is interesting to me is how it changes focus after the initial death of Novak's character. Up until then, the real focus has been on Novak, even though Stewart got more screen time and far more dialog. But after that initial death, the focus is even more on Stewart and his obsessions. That sudden change in focus is quite marvelous, although Stewart's obsession with the vertigo is clear in the beginning of the film...but later we see he is quite an obsessive character in many ways. One thing I am not clear on is the character played by Barbara Bel Geddes. I don't quite see the purpose...unless it is just a way to have Stewart bounce some ideas off of her. There are really only 5 actors worth mentioning in this film. I personally feel this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best roles. I'm very undecided overall about Kim Novak as an actress, but she was good here. I found Barbara Bel Geddes to be very comfortable on the screen; I wish she would have done more movie work, but I guess the blacklist soured her career for a while. Tom Helmore was good as the scheming husband; a dependable character actor. Henry Jones had a small role as the coroner, but I just love his voice inflections. The bottom line is -- is it a Hitchcock masterpiece. Although flawed, I would say yes, although not in his top 5, but somewhere in his top 10. Recommended.

Nowhere is this clearer than in the dated special effects in the film and the incredibly cheesy soundtrack that many of the older Hitchcock films are known for. Personally I do not have a problem either of these, as I find these aspects add to the classic feeling of the film; however, I can see it putting off some potential viewers. The only problem I had with the film was, as I mentioned above, is the films pacing. The film starts incredibly slow and is rather boring for the first thirty minutes before it begins picking up pace, however it then grinds to a second halt later on after the courtroom scene for another half hour before it finally picks up again for the climax of the film. While I can certainly forgive this in some ways, since the film is very entertaining when it is going at a decent pace, I still felt that it was quite jarring at several points during the movie. Overall I did enjoy Vertigo lot despite some issues I had with the pacing, but even with that issue I still feel that the film is a very entertaining watch, due to its unpredictable plot and the strong performances delivered by the lead actors. It is due to this that I am willing to rate Vertigo as an 8/10.

    Vertigo was a film that was ahead of its time when it was released. Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there. Sure in 1958 this movie was full of suspense and thought provoking cinema however in this era it just seems dull and lacks the suspense needed to make it enjoyable. The fact this film is called a 'suspense thriller' is almost laughable. The film seems to meander around shots of walking and driving and stalking for a good 40 minutes, something which when the film didn't start that great in the first place doesn't help its cause. The storyline was fairly obvious as well, even for a simpleton like me to guess, in addition to the dull as ditch water dialogue (even at the time) that's teemed with it. The directing as I've mentioned is not to blame and the use of colours and sound are brilliant by Hitchcock but that cannot make up for Vertigo which promised so much and produced so very little on the big screen. I would recommend this film to Hitchcock fans but it is by no means his best film, not even close. The lack of suspense and boring storyline despite the cleverness of Hitchcock means this film has to have 5 stars

    Though I enjoyed this film I think at times it can be overrated by various critics and members of the public. I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not 'a timeless classic' as it is often called. The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending. The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending. Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard. Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.

    . . . and craven coward John "Scottie" Ferguson (played here by James Stewart, in perhaps the most reprehensible role during his long film career as the Tom Hanks of his day) sure as heck doesn't give two hoots about the woman he's tossing away like a used facial tissue, either. Nor does Judy-from-Kansas' previous sugar daddy, John's college chum Gavin, who has foisted her off upon John in an overly complicated plot to help himself to an ahead-of-its-time no-fault divorce. John, a completely amoral "whited sepulcher," has no qualms about putting it to Judy when she's masquerading as Gavin's troubled wife, Madeleine. But as soon as John realizes that he is NOT having kinky hand-me-down sex with Gavin's actual discarded spouse, he scrapes Judy out of his life like "Doggie Doo-Doo" on the bottom of his shoe, with the help of the Catholic Church in the guise of a nun who "thought she heard voices." The latter woman intones "God have mercy"--as surely no one on the Corrupt Coast ever had had when poor deluded Judy was still alive--to close out this overwrought "sex mystery" (to use director Alfred Hitchcock's later genre description of MARNIE). Judy\"Madeleine's" downfall was never realizing she was living among the morally bankrupt, and coming to grips with the fact that she definitely "was not in Kansas anymore"!

    Since nearly 600 people have already reviewed this film on IMDb, I was going to skip it. But, it's sucked me in, so here goes. First I have to say that I have a far different view of Hitchcock's career than do most. First, I don't like any of Hitchcock's pre-Hollywood films, and detest some of them (e.g., "Murder!"). Then, in 1940, with "Rebecca", he seems to break out of the British fog and the films are suddenly almost all terrific...if not brilliant (with a rare exception here and there; e.g., "Lifeboat". But then, suddenly, in 1960, for me it all falls apart with "Psycho". The film has some redeeming qualities in terms of scenes, but in general I don't see it as much more than a cheap slasher movie with a little more psychology tossed in. And "The Birds" is for the birds...cheap horror inspired by Rachel Carson's "A Silent Spring". I can sit through "Torn Curtain", but more due to the star quality than the film itself. In terms of "Vertigo", there seem to be two sticking points for many people. One is the age of Jimmy Stewart (50) and Kim Novak (25). First, this is similar in many pictures with many stars -- an older male star with a younger female star. The only place it ever really bothered me was with Gary Cooper (age 56) and Audrey Hepburn (age 28) in "Love In The Afternoon"; and then it was more about Cooper's haggard looks than the actual age difference. Here, Stewart is a rather young looking 50, and in my view, Novak plays a character more in her mid to later 30s, despite her real age. Consider the age of her husband in the film, the actor being 54 years old. The other catching point for some is the flashback scene about 1:40 into the film. Some think that the scene gives too much away, while others think it gives the film context. I watched for it in this, my third viewing of the film. I can take it either way, because in my view, in many films it's not where you're going that's as important as how you get there. A third thing sometimes criticized about the film is its length at 2:08. I don't see that as so long, and I rather like that Hitchcock lingered a bit with his scenes of San Francisco and some other locations. One thing I will criticize about many Hitchcock films is the cheapness of many of the scenes which he shot in front of a projection screen. It ruined "To Catch A Thief" for me, and is pretty bad in this film as well. Is this where he often tried to save money? Another thing about this film that is interesting to me is how it changes focus after the initial death of Novak's character. Up until then, the real focus has been on Novak, even though Stewart got more screen time and far more dialog. But after that initial death, the focus is even more on Stewart and his obsessions. That sudden change in focus is quite marvelous, although Stewart's obsession with the vertigo is clear in the beginning of the film...but later we see he is quite an obsessive character in many ways. One thing I am not clear on is the character played by Barbara Bel Geddes. I don't quite see the purpose...unless it is just a way to have Stewart bounce some ideas off of her. There are really only 5 actors worth mentioning in this film. I personally feel this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best roles. I'm very undecided overall about Kim Novak as an actress, but she was good here. I found Barbara Bel Geddes to be very comfortable on the screen; I wish she would have done more movie work, but I guess the blacklist soured her career for a while. Tom Helmore was good as the scheming husband; a dependable character actor. Henry Jones had a small role as the coroner, but I just love his voice inflections. The bottom line is -- is it a Hitchcock masterpiece. Although flawed, I would say yes, although not in his top 5, but somewhere in his top 10. Recommended.

    A man's fear of heights lead to one woman falling off a church steeple, one woman purposely falling of the church steeple, and one man getting away with murder and stealing boat loads of money. But after I watched it the first time I said aloud, "What?" Vertigo, explicitly based off of The Living and the Dead by Bolieau-Narcjac, is based in San Francisco. To avoid spoilers, and make the movie sound interesting, a retired detective follows his lover all the way to death. But throughout the movie, it's a piece of deception, not just for the affected main character but also to the audience. You are literally blindsided at the end due to a "emotional shock" episode. But, don't get too comfortable when you watch the movie. There are moments of high suspense with extreme darkness and extreme light. There are also odd moments of excitement. Even with these odd moments, the ending is very abrupt. Even with the alternative ending, it didn't seemed fully complete. According to Turner Classic Movies, Hitchcock was never fully satisfied with the script. Three different writers re-wrote the movie till Hitchcock was the least dissatisfied. Odd moments like Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) leaving the psychiatric hospital talking to Scottie's (James Stewart) doctor and the "off" transition between her and the doctor was weird. After that, it was the last time we saw Midge. After Scottie left the hospital, it was never recognized again throughout the movie. Scottie's uncomfortably close watch of Madeline (Kim Novak.) Scottie's inquiries at Agory's Book Shop, the screen suddenly get dark, making you think the brightness on your device has had a lapse. Aside from scenes, looking at the film again, the foreshadowing is overwhelmingly obvious. Elster's (Tom Helmore) calm mode talking about his wife's, Madeline psychotic episodes, Madeline's whore-ish attitude toward Scottie, the cover of the film, and the unveiling of the deception two-thirds into the film. Even when Elster's wife jumped into the bay, her "husband" didn't care. The acting did a sure fire justice to screenplay.

    Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold. James Stewart is rather wooden in his role but is suitably matched by Kim Novak, whose pencilled eyebrows have more screen presence than the rest of her (not surprising given how huge they are!); Hitch must have been directing on Valium, such is the slowness of the pace; and the story is really mundane, with little in the way of excitement or suspense save for the opening rooftop chase scene. Quite what other Hitchcock fans are raving about when they claim this is amongst his best work is beyond meÂ—I struggled to stay awake.

    I've seen a total of 18 Hitchcock films since I started watching his films this year, and I've enjoyed all his works. I've been impressed with a good number of them, but after watching "Vertigo" for a 2nd time, I now believe this was Hitchcock's best work, and hence, his true masterpiece. The direction, the style, the story, the visuals, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the performances are all fantastic. I think it might be James Stewart's best performance out of all the films I've seen him in. Kim Novak also did a great job. Many Hitchcock films I've rated a 9/10, but in my opinion, this one deserves a 10/10! It's in my top ten favourite films of all time!

    This is probably the most divisive Hitchcock Movie. Dismissed in 1958 as unremarkable, slow, depressing, and was a Box-Office Flop, it is the more modern Viewers and Critics that now praise this as hypnotic, haunting, captivating, and deep. With some dissent it is Today considered one of the best Films ever, a Masterpiece, and definitive work of Art. Heaped with endless adulation and glowing, wordy essays, it is without doubt complex, meditative, and dreamlike in a way that is asking you to either fall for its impudent implications or not. The Film, in terms of Film Craft, contains impeccable Camera Work, a chilling Score, ethereal Color Schemes, some fine Acting and a Director who just might have bared His Soul for all to see becoming not the usual Voyeur but an Exhibionist. A flip flop of a Plot and Psychological maladies that are pure Hitchcockian. You could spend weeks reading up on the Film's nuances and find giddy Geek Writers wale endlessly on its meanings and double meanings, Doppelgangers and assorted dementia and neurosis. There are some who think this is dull, long, hammy, miscast, ridiculous, ludicrous, stiff, convoluted, and in the end not so much. But they would be in a very small minority. This is a Slow-Burner for sure, but beware, you might just get sucked into the Vortex, with its dizzying displays, morbid fascinations, and a nightmare ambiance.

    Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected-as I'm not the biggest fan of old movies- But not a great deal. I was rather confused throughout most the film. I did however like the story near more the beginning; the mystery around the whole madeleine character was rather intriguing, especially when the hotel housekeeper said she had not visited her room. I also liked how the audience saw the story threw Scotties eyes, not knowing about Judy until the flashback revealing everything. However I lost interest greatly when the flashback was shown as it answered the mystery of what was happening/happened to Madeleine (personally I would have kept the flashback till Scotty takes Judy to the tower) I think the Characters are a little boring, it took me a while to because interested and invested in the character, it did weird me out a bit when Scottie went a bit phyco and abusive towards Judy as he didn't seem to be that type of character up to that point. For the time it was made in I think the production values are very good, the only thing I thought was bad was whenever someone fell, it looked so bad but I could cope with it. I don't really think I would personally recommend it to my friends as it's not really a film they would be interested in. Nor do I think it's a film that really sticks out as memorable. For me personally I would not rate this in my top list of films. I would not class it in the worst films I've ever seen. It would probably be somewhere in the lower middle quarter. My main issue was it took too long to get into the main story line. I also don't understand why the nun scarred Judy so much, that was actually a little unrealistic. Although then again when I watched this alone I did get scared, but I mean if someone else was there I would not go slip off a building.

    Vertigo is like a roller-coaster. Not a good roller coaster, the type of roller coaster that takes half an hour to get up to the top and then when it finally gets to the first drop it starts to pick up speed before grinding to a sudden halt again. Vertigo was written by Alfred Hitchcock and released in theatres in 1958. The film is regarded as a classic and commonly seen as some of Hitchcock's best work, and honestly, after watching I can understand how people where able to come to this conclusion. The majority of the main cast is excellent, but the standout actor for me was certainly James Stewart plays our main character, John Ferguson, who deserves a large amount of praise for how convincingly he played his role throughout the film, as he changes from a sympathetic protagonist into a rather obsessive crazy psychopath driven by his grief throughout the film.

To avoid spoilers, and make the movie sound interesting, a retired detective follows his lover all the way to death. But throughout the movie, it's a piece of deception, not just for the affected main character but also to the audience. You are literally blindsided at the end due to a "emotional shock" episode. But, don't get too comfortable when you watch the movie. There are moments of high suspense with extreme darkness and extreme light. There are also odd moments of excitement. Even with these odd moments, the ending is very abrupt. Even with the alternative ending, it didn't seemed fully complete. According to Turner Classic Movies, Hitchcock was never fully satisfied with the script. Three different writers re-wrote the movie till Hitchcock was the least dissatisfied. Odd moments like Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) leaving the psychiatric hospital talking to Scottie's (James Stewart) doctor and the "off" transition between her and the doctor was weird. After that, it was the last time we saw Midge. After Scottie left the hospital, it was never recognized again throughout the movie. Scottie's uncomfortably close watch of Madeline (Kim Novak.) Scottie's inquiries at Agory's Book Shop, the screen suddenly get dark, making you think the brightness on your device has had a lapse. Aside from scenes, looking at the film again, the foreshadowing is overwhelmingly obvious. Elster's (Tom Helmore) calm mode talking about his wife's, Madeline psychotic episodes, Madeline's whore-ish attitude toward Scottie, the cover of the film, and the unveiling of the deception two-thirds into the film. Even when Elster's wife jumped into the bay, her "husband" didn't care. The acting did a sure fire justice to screenplay.

    Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold. James Stewart is rather wooden in his role but is suitably matched by Kim Novak, whose pencilled eyebrows have more screen presence than the rest of her (not surprising given how huge they are!); Hitch must have been directing on Valium, such is the slowness of the pace; and the story is really mundane, with little in the way of excitement or suspense save for the opening rooftop chase scene. Quite what other Hitchcock fans are raving about when they claim this is amongst his best work is beyond meÂ—I struggled to stay awake.

    I've seen a total of 18 Hitchcock films since I started watching his films this year, and I've enjoyed all his works. I've been impressed with a good number of them, but after watching "Vertigo" for a 2nd time, I now believe this was Hitchcock's best work, and hence, his true masterpiece. The direction, the style, the story, the visuals, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the performances are all fantastic. I think it might be James Stewart's best performance out of all the films I've seen him in. Kim Novak also did a great job. Many Hitchcock films I've rated a 9/10, but in my opinion, this one deserves a 10/10! It's in my top ten favourite films of all time!

    This is probably the most divisive Hitchcock Movie. Dismissed in 1958 as unremarkable, slow, depressing, and was a Box-Office Flop, it is the more modern Viewers and Critics that now praise this as hypnotic, haunting, captivating, and deep. With some dissent it is Today considered one of the best Films ever, a Masterpiece, and definitive work of Art. Heaped with endless adulation and glowing, wordy essays, it is without doubt complex, meditative, and dreamlike in a way that is asking you to either fall for its impudent implications or not. The Film, in terms of Film Craft, contains impeccable Camera Work, a chilling Score, ethereal Color Schemes, some fine Acting and a Director who just might have bared His Soul for all to see becoming not the usual Voyeur but an Exhibionist. A flip flop of a Plot and Psychological maladies that are pure Hitchcockian. You could spend weeks reading up on the Film's nuances and find giddy Geek Writers wale endlessly on its meanings and double meanings, Doppelgangers and assorted dementia and neurosis. There are some who think this is dull, long, hammy, miscast, ridiculous, ludicrous, stiff, convoluted, and in the end not so much. But they would be in a very small minority. This is a Slow-Burner for sure, but beware, you might just get sucked into the Vortex, with its dizzying displays, morbid fascinations, and a nightmare ambiance.

    Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected-as I'm not the biggest fan of old movies- But not a great deal. I was rather confused throughout most the film. I did however like the story near more the beginning; the mystery around the whole madeleine character was rather intriguing, especially when the hotel housekeeper said she had not visited her room. I also liked how the audience saw the story threw Scotties eyes, not knowing about Judy until the flashback revealing everything. However I lost interest greatly when the flashback was shown as it answered the mystery of what was happening/happened to Madeleine (personally I would have kept the flashback till Scotty takes Judy to the tower) I think the Characters are a little boring, it took me a while to because interested and invested in the character, it did weird me out a bit when Scottie went a bit phyco and abusive towards Judy as he didn't seem to be that type of character up to that point. For the time it was made in I think the production values are very good, the only thing I thought was bad was whenever someone fell, it looked so bad but I could cope with it. I don't really think I would personally recommend it to my friends as it's not really a film they would be interested in. Nor do I think it's a film that really sticks out as memorable. For me personally I would not rate this in my top list of films. I would not class it in the worst films I've ever seen. It would probably be somewhere in the lower middle quarter. My main issue was it took too long to get into the main story line. I also don't understand why the nun scarred Judy so much, that was actually a little unrealistic. Although then again when I watched this alone I did get scared, but I mean if someone else was there I would not go slip off a building.

    Vertigo is like a roller-coaster. Not a good roller coaster, the type of roller coaster that takes half an hour to get up to the top and then when it finally gets to the first drop it starts to pick up speed before grinding to a sudden halt again. Vertigo was written by Alfred Hitchcock and released in theatres in 1958. The film is regarded as a classic and commonly seen as some of Hitchcock's best work, and honestly, after watching I can understand how people where able to come to this conclusion. The majority of the main cast is excellent, but the standout actor for me was certainly James Stewart plays our main character, John Ferguson, who deserves a large amount of praise for how convincingly he played his role throughout the film, as he changes from a sympathetic protagonist into a rather obsessive crazy psychopath driven by his grief throughout the film. The film overall has a very strong plot with numerous unpredictable twists throughout that I would not even dare spoil. However in many ways the movie's age shows. Nowhere is this clearer than in the dated special effects in the film and the incredibly cheesy soundtrack that many of the older Hitchcock films are known for. Personally I do not have a problem either of these, as I find these aspects add to the classic feeling of the film; however, I can see it putting off some potential viewers. The only problem I had with the film was, as I mentioned above, is the films pacing. The film starts incredibly slow and is rather boring for the first thirty minutes before it begins picking up pace, however it then grinds to a second halt later on after the courtroom scene for another half hour before it finally picks up again for the climax of the film. While I can certainly forgive this in some ways, since the film is very entertaining when it is going at a decent pace, I still felt that it was quite jarring at several points during the movie. Overall I did enjoy Vertigo lot despite some issues I had with the pacing, but even with that issue I still feel that the film is a very entertaining watch, due to its unpredictable plot and the strong performances delivered by the lead actors. It is due to this that I am willing to rate Vertigo as an 8/10.

    Vertigo was a film that was ahead of its time when it was released. Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there. Sure in 1958 this movie was full of suspense and thought provoking cinema however in this era it just seems dull and lacks the suspense needed to make it enjoyable. The fact this film is called a 'suspense thriller' is almost laughable. The film seems to meander around shots of walking and driving and stalking for a good 40 minutes, something which when the film didn't start that great in the first place doesn't help its cause. The storyline was fairly obvious as well, even for a simpleton like me to guess, in addition to the dull as ditch water dialogue (even at the time) that's teemed with it. The directing as I've mentioned is not to blame and the use of colours and sound are brilliant by Hitchcock but that cannot make up for Vertigo which promised so much and produced so very little on the big screen. I would recommend this film to Hitchcock fans but it is by no means his best film, not even close. The lack of suspense and boring storyline despite the cleverness of Hitchcock means this film has to have 5 stars

    Though I enjoyed this film I think at times it can be overrated by various critics and members of the public. I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not 'a timeless classic' as it is often called. The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending. The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending. Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard. Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.

    . . . and craven coward John "Scottie" Ferguson (played here by James Stewart, in perhaps the most reprehensible role during his long film career as the Tom Hanks of his day) sure as heck doesn't give two hoots about the woman he's tossing away like a used facial tissue, either. Nor does Judy-from-Kansas' previous sugar daddy, John's college chum Gavin, who has foisted her off upon John in an overly complicated plot to help himself to an ahead-of-its-time no-fault divorce. John, a completely amoral "whited sepulcher," has no qualms about putting it to Judy when she's masquerading as Gavin's troubled wife, Madeleine. But as soon as John realizes that he is NOT having kinky hand-me-down sex with Gavin's actual discarded spouse, he scrapes Judy out of his life like "Doggie Doo-Doo" on the bottom of his shoe, with the help of the Catholic Church in the guise of a nun who "thought she heard voices." The latter woman intones "God have mercy"--as surely no one on the Corrupt Coast ever had had when poor deluded Judy was still alive--to close out this overwrought "sex mystery" (to use director Alfred Hitchcock's later genre description of MARNIE). Judy\"Madeleine's" downfall was never realizing she was living among the morally bankrupt, and coming to grips with the fact that she definitely "was not in Kansas anymore"!

    Since nearly 600 people have already reviewed this film on IMDb, I was going to skip it. But, it's sucked me in, so here goes. First I have to say that I have a far different view of Hitchcock's career than do most. First, I don't like any of Hitchcock's pre-Hollywood films, and detest some of them (e.g., "Murder!"). Then, in 1940, with "Rebecca", he seems to break out of the British fog and the films are suddenly almost all terrific...if not brilliant (with a rare exception here and there; e.g., "Lifeboat". But then, suddenly, in 1960, for me it all falls apart with "Psycho". The film has some redeeming qualities in terms of scenes, but in general I don't see it as much more than a cheap slasher movie with a little more psychology tossed in. And "The Birds" is for the birds...cheap horror inspired by Rachel Carson's "A Silent Spring". I can sit through "Torn Curtain", but more due to the star quality than the film itself. In terms of "Vertigo", there seem to be two sticking points for many people. One is the age of Jimmy Stewart (50) and Kim Novak (25). First, this is similar in many pictures with many stars -- an older male star with a younger female star. The only place it ever really bothered me was with Gary Cooper (age 56) and Audrey Hepburn (age 28) in "Love In The Afternoon"; and then it was more about Cooper's haggard looks than the actual age difference. Here, Stewart is a rather young looking 50, and in my view, Novak plays a character more in her mid to later 30s, despite her real age. Consider the age of her husband in the film, the actor being 54 years old. The other catching point for some is the flashback scene about 1:40 into the film. Some think that the scene gives too much away, while others think it gives the film context. I watched for it in this, my third viewing of the film. I can take it either way, because in my view, in many films it's not where you're going that's as important as how you get there. A third thing sometimes criticized about the film is its length at 2:08. I don't see that as so long, and I rather like that Hitchcock lingered a bit with his scenes of San Francisco and some other locations. One thing I will criticize about many Hitchcock films is the cheapness of many of the scenes which he shot in front of a projection screen. It ruined "To Catch A Thief" for me, and is pretty bad in this film as well. Is this where he often tried to save money? Another thing about this film that is interesting to me is how it changes focus after the initial death of Novak's character. Up until then, the real focus has been on Novak, even though Stewart got more screen time and far more dialog. But after that initial death, the focus is even more on Stewart and his obsessions. That sudden change in focus is quite marvelous, although Stewart's obsession with the vertigo is clear in the beginning of the film...but later we see he is quite an obsessive character in many ways. One thing I am not clear on is the character played by Barbara Bel Geddes. I don't quite see the purpose...unless it is just a way to have Stewart bounce some ideas off of her. There are really only 5 actors worth mentioning in this film. I personally feel this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best roles. I'm very undecided overall about Kim Novak as an actress, but she was good here. I found Barbara Bel Geddes to be very comfortable on the screen; I wish she would have done more movie work, but I guess the blacklist soured her career for a while. Tom Helmore was good as the scheming husband; a dependable character actor. Henry Jones had a small role as the coroner, but I just love his voice inflections. The bottom line is -- is it a Hitchcock masterpiece. Although flawed, I would say yes, although not in his top 5, but somewhere in his top 10. Recommended.

The directing as I've mentioned is not to blame and the use of colours and sound are brilliant by Hitchcock but that cannot make up for Vertigo which promised so much and produced so very little on the big screen. I would recommend this film to Hitchcock fans but it is by no means his best film, not even close. The lack of suspense and boring storyline despite the cleverness of Hitchcock means this film has to have 5 stars

    Though I enjoyed this film I think at times it can be overrated by various critics and members of the public. I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not 'a timeless classic' as it is often called. The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending. The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending. Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard. Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.

    . . . and craven coward John "Scottie" Ferguson (played here by James Stewart, in perhaps the most reprehensible role during his long film career as the Tom Hanks of his day) sure as heck doesn't give two hoots about the woman he's tossing away like a used facial tissue, either. Nor does Judy-from-Kansas' previous sugar daddy, John's college chum Gavin, who has foisted her off upon John in an overly complicated plot to help himself to an ahead-of-its-time no-fault divorce. John, a completely amoral "whited sepulcher," has no qualms about putting it to Judy when she's masquerading as Gavin's troubled wife, Madeleine. But as soon as John realizes that he is NOT having kinky hand-me-down sex with Gavin's actual discarded spouse, he scrapes Judy out of his life like "Doggie Doo-Doo" on the bottom of his shoe, with the help of the Catholic Church in the guise of a nun who "thought she heard voices." The latter woman intones "God have mercy"--as surely no one on the Corrupt Coast ever had had when poor deluded Judy was still alive--to close out this overwrought "sex mystery" (to use director Alfred Hitchcock's later genre description of MARNIE). Judy\"Madeleine's" downfall was never realizing she was living among the morally bankrupt, and coming to grips with the fact that she definitely "was not in Kansas anymore"!

    Since nearly 600 people have already reviewed this film on IMDb, I was going to skip it. But, it's sucked me in, so here goes. First I have to say that I have a far different view of Hitchcock's career than do most. First, I don't like any of Hitchcock's pre-Hollywood films, and detest some of them (e.g., "Murder!"). Then, in 1940, with "Rebecca", he seems to break out of the British fog and the films are suddenly almost all terrific...if not brilliant (with a rare exception here and there; e.g., "Lifeboat". But then, suddenly, in 1960, for me it all falls apart with "Psycho". The film has some redeeming qualities in terms of scenes, but in general I don't see it as much more than a cheap slasher movie with a little more psychology tossed in. And "The Birds" is for the birds...cheap horror inspired by Rachel Carson's "A Silent Spring". I can sit through "Torn Curtain", but more due to the star quality than the film itself. In terms of "Vertigo", there seem to be two sticking points for many people. One is the age of Jimmy Stewart (50) and Kim Novak (25). First, this is similar in many pictures with many stars -- an older male star with a younger female star. The only place it ever really bothered me was with Gary Cooper (age 56) and Audrey Hepburn (age 28) in "Love In The Afternoon"; and then it was more about Cooper's haggard looks than the actual age difference. Here, Stewart is a rather young looking 50, and in my view, Novak plays a character more in her mid to later 30s, despite her real age. Consider the age of her husband in the film, the actor being 54 years old. The other catching point for some is the flashback scene about 1:40 into the film. Some think that the scene gives too much away, while others think it gives the film context. I watched for it in this, my third viewing of the film. I can take it either way, because in my view, in many films it's not where you're going that's as important as how you get there. A third thing sometimes criticized about the film is its length at 2:08. I don't see that as so long, and I rather like that Hitchcock lingered a bit with his scenes of San Francisco and some other locations. One thing I will criticize about many Hitchcock films is the cheapness of many of the scenes which he shot in front of a projection screen. It ruined "To Catch A Thief" for me, and is pretty bad in this film as well. Is this where he often tried to save money? Another thing about this film that is interesting to me is how it changes focus after the initial death of Novak's character. Up until then, the real focus has been on Novak, even though Stewart got more screen time and far more dialog. But after that initial death, the focus is even more on Stewart and his obsessions. That sudden change in focus is quite marvelous, although Stewart's obsession with the vertigo is clear in the beginning of the film...but later we see he is quite an obsessive character in many ways. One thing I am not clear on is the character played by Barbara Bel Geddes. I don't quite see the purpose...unless it is just a way to have Stewart bounce some ideas off of her. There are really only 5 actors worth mentioning in this film. I personally feel this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best roles. I'm very undecided overall about Kim Novak as an actress, but she was good here. I found Barbara Bel Geddes to be very comfortable on the screen; I wish she would have done more movie work, but I guess the blacklist soured her career for a while. Tom Helmore was good as the scheming husband; a dependable character actor. Henry Jones had a small role as the coroner, but I just love his voice inflections. The bottom line is -- is it a Hitchcock masterpiece. Although flawed, I would say yes, although not in his top 5, but somewhere in his top 10. Recommended.

    A man's fear of heights lead to one woman falling off a church steeple, one woman purposely falling of the church steeple, and one man getting away with murder and stealing boat loads of money. But after I watched it the first time I said aloud, "What?" Vertigo, explicitly based off of The Living and the Dead by Bolieau-Narcjac, is based in San Francisco. To avoid spoilers, and make the movie sound interesting, a retired detective follows his lover all the way to death. But throughout the movie, it's a piece of deception, not just for the affected main character but also to the audience. You are literally blindsided at the end due to a "emotional shock" episode. But, don't get too comfortable when you watch the movie. There are moments of high suspense with extreme darkness and extreme light. There are also odd moments of excitement. Even with these odd moments, the ending is very abrupt. Even with the alternative ending, it didn't seemed fully complete. According to Turner Classic Movies, Hitchcock was never fully satisfied with the script. Three different writers re-wrote the movie till Hitchcock was the least dissatisfied. Odd moments like Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) leaving the psychiatric hospital talking to Scottie's (James Stewart) doctor and the "off" transition between her and the doctor was weird. After that, it was the last time we saw Midge. After Scottie left the hospital, it was never recognized again throughout the movie. Scottie's uncomfortably close watch of Madeline (Kim Novak.) Scottie's inquiries at Agory's Book Shop, the screen suddenly get dark, making you think the brightness on your device has had a lapse. Aside from scenes, looking at the film again, the foreshadowing is overwhelmingly obvious. Elster's (Tom Helmore) calm mode talking about his wife's, Madeline psychotic episodes, Madeline's whore-ish attitude toward Scottie, the cover of the film, and the unveiling of the deception two-thirds into the film. Even when Elster's wife jumped into the bay, her "husband" didn't care. The acting did a sure fire justice to screenplay.

    Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold. James Stewart is rather wooden in his role but is suitably matched by Kim Novak, whose pencilled eyebrows have more screen presence than the rest of her (not surprising given how huge they are!); Hitch must have been directing on Valium, such is the slowness of the pace; and the story is really mundane, with little in the way of excitement or suspense save for the opening rooftop chase scene. Quite what other Hitchcock fans are raving about when they claim this is amongst his best work is beyond meÂ—I struggled to stay awake.

    I've seen a total of 18 Hitchcock films since I started watching his films this year, and I've enjoyed all his works. I've been impressed with a good number of them, but after watching "Vertigo" for a 2nd time, I now believe this was Hitchcock's best work, and hence, his true masterpiece. The direction, the style, the story, the visuals, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the performances are all fantastic. I think it might be James Stewart's best performance out of all the films I've seen him in. Kim Novak also did a great job. Many Hitchcock films I've rated a 9/10, but in my opinion, this one deserves a 10/10! It's in my top ten favourite films of all time!

    This is probably the most divisive Hitchcock Movie. Dismissed in 1958 as unremarkable, slow, depressing, and was a Box-Office Flop, it is the more modern Viewers and Critics that now praise this as hypnotic, haunting, captivating, and deep. With some dissent it is Today considered one of the best Films ever, a Masterpiece, and definitive work of Art. Heaped with endless adulation and glowing, wordy essays, it is without doubt complex, meditative, and dreamlike in a way that is asking you to either fall for its impudent implications or not. The Film, in terms of Film Craft, contains impeccable Camera Work, a chilling Score, ethereal Color Schemes, some fine Acting and a Director who just might have bared His Soul for all to see becoming not the usual Voyeur but an Exhibionist. A flip flop of a Plot and Psychological maladies that are pure Hitchcockian. You could spend weeks reading up on the Film's nuances and find giddy Geek Writers wale endlessly on its meanings and double meanings, Doppelgangers and assorted dementia and neurosis. There are some who think this is dull, long, hammy, miscast, ridiculous, ludicrous, stiff, convoluted, and in the end not so much. But they would be in a very small minority. This is a Slow-Burner for sure, but beware, you might just get sucked into the Vortex, with its dizzying displays, morbid fascinations, and a nightmare ambiance.

    Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected-as I'm not the biggest fan of old movies- But not a great deal. I was rather confused throughout most the film. I did however like the story near more the beginning; the mystery around the whole madeleine character was rather intriguing, especially when the hotel housekeeper said she had not visited her room. I also liked how the audience saw the story threw Scotties eyes, not knowing about Judy until the flashback revealing everything. However I lost interest greatly when the flashback was shown as it answered the mystery of what was happening/happened to Madeleine (personally I would have kept the flashback till Scotty takes Judy to the tower) I think the Characters are a little boring, it took me a while to because interested and invested in the character, it did weird me out a bit when Scottie went a bit phyco and abusive towards Judy as he didn't seem to be that type of character up to that point. For the time it was made in I think the production values are very good, the only thing I thought was bad was whenever someone fell, it looked so bad but I could cope with it. I don't really think I would personally recommend it to my friends as it's not really a film they would be interested in. Nor do I think it's a film that really sticks out as memorable. For me personally I would not rate this in my top list of films. I would not class it in the worst films I've ever seen. It would probably be somewhere in the lower middle quarter. My main issue was it took too long to get into the main story line. I also don't understand why the nun scarred Judy so much, that was actually a little unrealistic. Although then again when I watched this alone I did get scared, but I mean if someone else was there I would not go slip off a building.

    Vertigo is like a roller-coaster. Not a good roller coaster, the type of roller coaster that takes half an hour to get up to the top and then when it finally gets to the first drop it starts to pick up speed before grinding to a sudden halt again. Vertigo was written by Alfred Hitchcock and released in theatres in 1958. The film is regarded as a classic and commonly seen as some of Hitchcock's best work, and honestly, after watching I can understand how people where able to come to this conclusion. The majority of the main cast is excellent, but the standout actor for me was certainly James Stewart plays our main character, John Ferguson, who deserves a large amount of praise for how convincingly he played his role throughout the film, as he changes from a sympathetic protagonist into a rather obsessive crazy psychopath driven by his grief throughout the film. The film overall has a very strong plot with numerous unpredictable twists throughout that I would not even dare spoil. However in many ways the movie's age shows. Nowhere is this clearer than in the dated special effects in the film and the incredibly cheesy soundtrack that many of the older Hitchcock films are known for. Personally I do not have a problem either of these, as I find these aspects add to the classic feeling of the film; however, I can see it putting off some potential viewers. The only problem I had with the film was, as I mentioned above, is the films pacing. The film starts incredibly slow and is rather boring for the first thirty minutes before it begins picking up pace, however it then grinds to a second halt later on after the courtroom scene for another half hour before it finally picks up again for the climax of the film. While I can certainly forgive this in some ways, since the film is very entertaining when it is going at a decent pace, I still felt that it was quite jarring at several points during the movie. Overall I did enjoy Vertigo lot despite some issues I had with the pacing, but even with that issue I still feel that the film is a very entertaining watch, due to its unpredictable plot and the strong performances delivered by the lead actors. It is due to this that I am willing to rate Vertigo as an 8/10.

    Vertigo was a film that was ahead of its time when it was released. Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there. Sure in 1958 this movie was full of suspense and thought provoking cinema however in this era it just seems dull and lacks the suspense needed to make it enjoyable. The fact this film is called a 'suspense thriller' is almost laughable. The film seems to meander around shots of walking and driving and stalking for a good 40 minutes, something which when the film didn't start that great in the first place doesn't help its cause. The storyline was fairly obvious as well, even for a simpleton like me to guess, in addition to the dull as ditch water dialogue (even at the time) that's teemed with it.

    I've seen a total of 18 Hitchcock films since I started watching his films this year, and I've enjoyed all his works. I've been impressed with a good number of them, but after watching "Vertigo" for a 2nd time, I now believe this was Hitchcock's best work, and hence, his true masterpiece. The direction, the style, the story, the visuals, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the performances are all fantastic. I think it might be James Stewart's best performance out of all the films I've seen him in. Kim Novak also did a great job. Many Hitchcock films I've rated a 9/10, but in my opinion, this one deserves a 10/10! It's in my top ten favourite films of all time!

    This is probably the most divisive Hitchcock Movie. Dismissed in 1958 as unremarkable, slow, depressing, and was a Box-Office Flop, it is the more modern Viewers and Critics that now praise this as hypnotic, haunting, captivating, and deep. With some dissent it is Today considered one of the best Films ever, a Masterpiece, and definitive work of Art. Heaped with endless adulation and glowing, wordy essays, it is without doubt complex, meditative, and dreamlike in a way that is asking you to either fall for its impudent implications or not. The Film, in terms of Film Craft, contains impeccable Camera Work, a chilling Score, ethereal Color Schemes, some fine Acting and a Director who just might have bared His Soul for all to see becoming not the usual Voyeur but an Exhibionist. A flip flop of a Plot and Psychological maladies that are pure Hitchcockian. You could spend weeks reading up on the Film's nuances and find giddy Geek Writers wale endlessly on its meanings and double meanings, Doppelgangers and assorted dementia and neurosis. There are some who think this is dull, long, hammy, miscast, ridiculous, ludicrous, stiff, convoluted, and in the end not so much. But they would be in a very small minority. This is a Slow-Burner for sure, but beware, you might just get sucked into the Vortex, with its dizzying displays, morbid fascinations, and a nightmare ambiance.

    Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected-as I'm not the biggest fan of old movies- But not a great deal. I was rather confused throughout most the film. I did however like the story near more the beginning; the mystery around the whole madeleine character was rather intriguing, especially when the hotel housekeeper said she had not visited her room. I also liked how the audience saw the story threw Scotties eyes, not knowing about Judy until the flashback revealing everything. However I lost interest greatly when the flashback was shown as it answered the mystery of what was happening/happened to Madeleine (personally I would have kept the flashback till Scotty takes Judy to the tower) I think the Characters are a little boring, it took me a while to because interested and invested in the character, it did weird me out a bit when Scottie went a bit phyco and abusive towards Judy as he didn't seem to be that type of character up to that point. For the time it was made in I think the production values are very good, the only thing I thought was bad was whenever someone fell, it looked so bad but I could cope with it. I don't really think I would personally recommend it to my friends as it's not really a film they would be interested in. Nor do I think it's a film that really sticks out as memorable. For me personally I would not rate this in my top list of films. I would not class it in the worst films I've ever seen. It would probably be somewhere in the lower middle quarter. My main issue was it took too long to get into the main story line. I also don't understand why the nun scarred Judy so much, that was actually a little unrealistic. Although then again when I watched this alone I did get scared, but I mean if someone else was there I would not go slip off a building.

    Vertigo is like a roller-coaster. Not a good roller coaster, the type of roller coaster that takes half an hour to get up to the top and then when it finally gets to the first drop it starts to pick up speed before grinding to a sudden halt again. Vertigo was written by Alfred Hitchcock and released in theatres in 1958. The film is regarded as a classic and commonly seen as some of Hitchcock's best work, and honestly, after watching I can understand how people where able to come to this conclusion. The majority of the main cast is excellent, but the standout actor for me was certainly James Stewart plays our main character, John Ferguson, who deserves a large amount of praise for how convincingly he played his role throughout the film, as he changes from a sympathetic protagonist into a rather obsessive crazy psychopath driven by his grief throughout the film. The film overall has a very strong plot with numerous unpredictable twists throughout that I would not even dare spoil. However in many ways the movie's age shows. Nowhere is this clearer than in the dated special effects in the film and the incredibly cheesy soundtrack that many of the older Hitchcock films are known for. Personally I do not have a problem either of these, as I find these aspects add to the classic feeling of the film; however, I can see it putting off some potential viewers. The only problem I had with the film was, as I mentioned above, is the films pacing. The film starts incredibly slow and is rather boring for the first thirty minutes before it begins picking up pace, however it then grinds to a second halt later on after the courtroom scene for another half hour before it finally picks up again for the climax of the film. While I can certainly forgive this in some ways, since the film is very entertaining when it is going at a decent pace, I still felt that it was quite jarring at several points during the movie. Overall I did enjoy Vertigo lot despite some issues I had with the pacing, but even with that issue I still feel that the film is a very entertaining watch, due to its unpredictable plot and the strong performances delivered by the lead actors. It is due to this that I am willing to rate Vertigo as an 8/10.

    Vertigo was a film that was ahead of its time when it was released. Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there. Sure in 1958 this movie was full of suspense and thought provoking cinema however in this era it just seems dull and lacks the suspense needed to make it enjoyable. The fact this film is called a 'suspense thriller' is almost laughable. The film seems to meander around shots of walking and driving and stalking for a good 40 minutes, something which when the film didn't start that great in the first place doesn't help its cause. The storyline was fairly obvious as well, even for a simpleton like me to guess, in addition to the dull as ditch water dialogue (even at the time) that's teemed with it. The directing as I've mentioned is not to blame and the use of colours and sound are brilliant by Hitchcock but that cannot make up for Vertigo which promised so much and produced so very little on the big screen. I would recommend this film to Hitchcock fans but it is by no means his best film, not even close. The lack of suspense and boring storyline despite the cleverness of Hitchcock means this film has to have 5 stars

    Though I enjoyed this film I think at times it can be overrated by various critics and members of the public. I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not 'a timeless classic' as it is often called. The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending. The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending. Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard. Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.

    . . . and craven coward John "Scottie" Ferguson (played here by James Stewart, in perhaps the most reprehensible role during his long film career as the Tom Hanks of his day) sure as heck doesn't give two hoots about the woman he's tossing away like a used facial tissue, either. Nor does Judy-from-Kansas' previous sugar daddy, John's college chum Gavin, who has foisted her off upon John in an overly complicated plot to help himself to an ahead-of-its-time no-fault divorce. John, a completely amoral "whited sepulcher," has no qualms about putting it to Judy when she's masquerading as Gavin's troubled wife, Madeleine. But as soon as John realizes that he is NOT having kinky hand-me-down sex with Gavin's actual discarded spouse, he scrapes Judy out of his life like "Doggie Doo-Doo" on the bottom of his shoe, with the help of the Catholic Church in the guise of a nun who "thought she heard voices." The latter woman intones "God have mercy"--as surely no one on the Corrupt Coast ever had had when poor deluded Judy was still alive--to close out this overwrought "sex mystery" (to use director Alfred Hitchcock's later genre description of MARNIE). Judy\"Madeleine's" downfall was never realizing she was living among the morally bankrupt, and coming to grips with the fact that she definitely "was not in Kansas anymore"!

    Since nearly 600 people have already reviewed this film on IMDb, I was going to skip it. But, it's sucked me in, so here goes. First I have to say that I have a far different view of Hitchcock's career than do most. First, I don't like any of Hitchcock's pre-Hollywood films, and detest some of them (e.g., "Murder!"). Then, in 1940, with "Rebecca", he seems to break out of the British fog and the films are suddenly almost all terrific...if not brilliant (with a rare exception here and there; e.g., "Lifeboat". But then, suddenly, in 1960, for me it all falls apart with "Psycho". The film has some redeeming qualities in terms of scenes, but in general I don't see it as much more than a cheap slasher movie with a little more psychology tossed in. And "The Birds" is for the birds...cheap horror inspired by Rachel Carson's "A Silent Spring". I can sit through "Torn Curtain", but more due to the star quality than the film itself. In terms of "Vertigo", there seem to be two sticking points for many people. One is the age of Jimmy Stewart (50) and Kim Novak (25). First, this is similar in many pictures with many stars -- an older male star with a younger female star. The only place it ever really bothered me was with Gary Cooper (age 56) and Audrey Hepburn (age 28) in "Love In The Afternoon"; and then it was more about Cooper's haggard looks than the actual age difference. Here, Stewart is a rather young looking 50, and in my view, Novak plays a character more in her mid to later 30s, despite her real age. Consider the age of her husband in the film, the actor being 54 years old. The other catching point for some is the flashback scene about 1:40 into the film. Some think that the scene gives too much away, while others think it gives the film context. I watched for it in this, my third viewing of the film. I can take it either way, because in my view, in many films it's not where you're going that's as important as how you get there. A third thing sometimes criticized about the film is its length at 2:08. I don't see that as so long, and I rather like that Hitchcock lingered a bit with his scenes of San Francisco and some other locations. One thing I will criticize about many Hitchcock films is the cheapness of many of the scenes which he shot in front of a projection screen. It ruined "To Catch A Thief" for me, and is pretty bad in this film as well. Is this where he often tried to save money? Another thing about this film that is interesting to me is how it changes focus after the initial death of Novak's character. Up until then, the real focus has been on Novak, even though Stewart got more screen time and far more dialog. But after that initial death, the focus is even more on Stewart and his obsessions. That sudden change in focus is quite marvelous, although Stewart's obsession with the vertigo is clear in the beginning of the film...but later we see he is quite an obsessive character in many ways. One thing I am not clear on is the character played by Barbara Bel Geddes. I don't quite see the purpose...unless it is just a way to have Stewart bounce some ideas off of her. There are really only 5 actors worth mentioning in this film. I personally feel this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best roles. I'm very undecided overall about Kim Novak as an actress, but she was good here. I found Barbara Bel Geddes to be very comfortable on the screen; I wish she would have done more movie work, but I guess the blacklist soured her career for a while. Tom Helmore was good as the scheming husband; a dependable character actor. Henry Jones had a small role as the coroner, but I just love his voice inflections. The bottom line is -- is it a Hitchcock masterpiece. Although flawed, I would say yes, although not in his top 5, but somewhere in his top 10. Recommended.

    A man's fear of heights lead to one woman falling off a church steeple, one woman purposely falling of the church steeple, and one man getting away with murder and stealing boat loads of money. But after I watched it the first time I said aloud, "What?" Vertigo, explicitly based off of The Living and the Dead by Bolieau-Narcjac, is based in San Francisco. To avoid spoilers, and make the movie sound interesting, a retired detective follows his lover all the way to death. But throughout the movie, it's a piece of deception, not just for the affected main character but also to the audience. You are literally blindsided at the end due to a "emotional shock" episode. But, don't get too comfortable when you watch the movie. There are moments of high suspense with extreme darkness and extreme light. There are also odd moments of excitement. Even with these odd moments, the ending is very abrupt. Even with the alternative ending, it didn't seemed fully complete. According to Turner Classic Movies, Hitchcock was never fully satisfied with the script. Three different writers re-wrote the movie till Hitchcock was the least dissatisfied. Odd moments like Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) leaving the psychiatric hospital talking to Scottie's (James Stewart) doctor and the "off" transition between her and the doctor was weird. After that, it was the last time we saw Midge. After Scottie left the hospital, it was never recognized again throughout the movie. Scottie's uncomfortably close watch of Madeline (Kim Novak.) Scottie's inquiries at Agory's Book Shop, the screen suddenly get dark, making you think the brightness on your device has had a lapse. Aside from scenes, looking at the film again, the foreshadowing is overwhelmingly obvious. Elster's (Tom Helmore) calm mode talking about his wife's, Madeline psychotic episodes, Madeline's whore-ish attitude toward Scottie, the cover of the film, and the unveiling of the deception two-thirds into the film. Even when Elster's wife jumped into the bay, her "husband" didn't care. The acting did a sure fire justice to screenplay.

    Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold. James Stewart is rather wooden in his role but is suitably matched by Kim Novak, whose pencilled eyebrows have more screen presence than the rest of her (not surprising given how huge they are!); Hitch must have been directing on Valium, such is the slowness of the pace; and the story is really mundane, with little in the way of excitement or suspense save for the opening rooftop chase scene. Quite what other Hitchcock fans are raving about when they claim this is amongst his best work is beyond meÂ—I struggled to stay awake.

John, a completely amoral "whited sepulcher," has no qualms about putting it to Judy when she's masquerading as Gavin's troubled wife, Madeleine. But as soon as John realizes that he is NOT having kinky hand-me-down sex with Gavin's actual discarded spouse, he scrapes Judy out of his life like "Doggie Doo-Doo" on the bottom of his shoe, with the help of the Catholic Church in the guise of a nun who "thought she heard voices." The latter woman intones "God have mercy"--as surely no one on the Corrupt Coast ever had had when poor deluded Judy was still alive--to close out this overwrought "sex mystery" (to use director Alfred Hitchcock's later genre description of MARNIE). Judy\"Madeleine's" downfall was never realizing she was living among the morally bankrupt, and coming to grips with the fact that she definitely "was not in Kansas anymore"!

    Since nearly 600 people have already reviewed this film on IMDb, I was going to skip it. But, it's sucked me in, so here goes. First I have to say that I have a far different view of Hitchcock's career than do most. First, I don't like any of Hitchcock's pre-Hollywood films, and detest some of them (e.g., "Murder!"). Then, in 1940, with "Rebecca", he seems to break out of the British fog and the films are suddenly almost all terrific...if not brilliant (with a rare exception here and there; e.g., "Lifeboat". But then, suddenly, in 1960, for me it all falls apart with "Psycho". The film has some redeeming qualities in terms of scenes, but in general I don't see it as much more than a cheap slasher movie with a little more psychology tossed in. And "The Birds" is for the birds...cheap horror inspired by Rachel Carson's "A Silent Spring". I can sit through "Torn Curtain", but more due to the star quality than the film itself. In terms of "Vertigo", there seem to be two sticking points for many people. One is the age of Jimmy Stewart (50) and Kim Novak (25). First, this is similar in many pictures with many stars -- an older male star with a younger female star. The only place it ever really bothered me was with Gary Cooper (age 56) and Audrey Hepburn (age 28) in "Love In The Afternoon"; and then it was more about Cooper's haggard looks than the actual age difference. Here, Stewart is a rather young looking 50, and in my view, Novak plays a character more in her mid to later 30s, despite her real age. Consider the age of her husband in the film, the actor being 54 years old. The other catching point for some is the flashback scene about 1:40 into the film. Some think that the scene gives too much away, while others think it gives the film context. I watched for it in this, my third viewing of the film. I can take it either way, because in my view, in many films it's not where you're going that's as important as how you get there. A third thing sometimes criticized about the film is its length at 2:08. I don't see that as so long, and I rather like that Hitchcock lingered a bit with his scenes of San Francisco and some other locations. One thing I will criticize about many Hitchcock films is the cheapness of many of the scenes which he shot in front of a projection screen. It ruined "To Catch A Thief" for me, and is pretty bad in this film as well. Is this where he often tried to save money? Another thing about this film that is interesting to me is how it changes focus after the initial death of Novak's character. Up until then, the real focus has been on Novak, even though Stewart got more screen time and far more dialog. But after that initial death, the focus is even more on Stewart and his obsessions. That sudden change in focus is quite marvelous, although Stewart's obsession with the vertigo is clear in the beginning of the film...but later we see he is quite an obsessive character in many ways. One thing I am not clear on is the character played by Barbara Bel Geddes. I don't quite see the purpose...unless it is just a way to have Stewart bounce some ideas off of her. There are really only 5 actors worth mentioning in this film. I personally feel this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best roles. I'm very undecided overall about Kim Novak as an actress, but she was good here. I found Barbara Bel Geddes to be very comfortable on the screen; I wish she would have done more movie work, but I guess the blacklist soured her career for a while. Tom Helmore was good as the scheming husband; a dependable character actor. Henry Jones had a small role as the coroner, but I just love his voice inflections. The bottom line is -- is it a Hitchcock masterpiece. Although flawed, I would say yes, although not in his top 5, but somewhere in his top 10. Recommended.

    A man's fear of heights lead to one woman falling off a church steeple, one woman purposely falling of the church steeple, and one man getting away with murder and stealing boat loads of money. But after I watched it the first time I said aloud, "What?" Vertigo, explicitly based off of The Living and the Dead by Bolieau-Narcjac, is based in San Francisco. To avoid spoilers, and make the movie sound interesting, a retired detective follows his lover all the way to death. But throughout the movie, it's a piece of deception, not just for the affected main character but also to the audience. You are literally blindsided at the end due to a "emotional shock" episode. But, don't get too comfortable when you watch the movie. There are moments of high suspense with extreme darkness and extreme light. There are also odd moments of excitement. Even with these odd moments, the ending is very abrupt. Even with the alternative ending, it didn't seemed fully complete. According to Turner Classic Movies, Hitchcock was never fully satisfied with the script. Three different writers re-wrote the movie till Hitchcock was the least dissatisfied. Odd moments like Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) leaving the psychiatric hospital talking to Scottie's (James Stewart) doctor and the "off" transition between her and the doctor was weird. After that, it was the last time we saw Midge. After Scottie left the hospital, it was never recognized again throughout the movie. Scottie's uncomfortably close watch of Madeline (Kim Novak.) Scottie's inquiries at Agory's Book Shop, the screen suddenly get dark, making you think the brightness on your device has had a lapse. Aside from scenes, looking at the film again, the foreshadowing is overwhelmingly obvious. Elster's (Tom Helmore) calm mode talking about his wife's, Madeline psychotic episodes, Madeline's whore-ish attitude toward Scottie, the cover of the film, and the unveiling of the deception two-thirds into the film. Even when Elster's wife jumped into the bay, her "husband" didn't care. The acting did a sure fire justice to screenplay.

    Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold. James Stewart is rather wooden in his role but is suitably matched by Kim Novak, whose pencilled eyebrows have more screen presence than the rest of her (not surprising given how huge they are!); Hitch must have been directing on Valium, such is the slowness of the pace; and the story is really mundane, with little in the way of excitement or suspense save for the opening rooftop chase scene. Quite what other Hitchcock fans are raving about when they claim this is amongst his best work is beyond meÂ—I struggled to stay awake.

    I've seen a total of 18 Hitchcock films since I started watching his films this year, and I've enjoyed all his works. I've been impressed with a good number of them, but after watching "Vertigo" for a 2nd time, I now believe this was Hitchcock's best work, and hence, his true masterpiece. The direction, the style, the story, the visuals, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the performances are all fantastic. I think it might be James Stewart's best performance out of all the films I've seen him in. Kim Novak also did a great job. Many Hitchcock films I've rated a 9/10, but in my opinion, this one deserves a 10/10! It's in my top ten favourite films of all time!

    This is probably the most divisive Hitchcock Movie. Dismissed in 1958 as unremarkable, slow, depressing, and was a Box-Office Flop, it is the more modern Viewers and Critics that now praise this as hypnotic, haunting, captivating, and deep. With some dissent it is Today considered one of the best Films ever, a Masterpiece, and definitive work of Art. Heaped with endless adulation and glowing, wordy essays, it is without doubt complex, meditative, and dreamlike in a way that is asking you to either fall for its impudent implications or not. The Film, in terms of Film Craft, contains impeccable Camera Work, a chilling Score, ethereal Color Schemes, some fine Acting and a Director who just might have bared His Soul for all to see becoming not the usual Voyeur but an Exhibionist. A flip flop of a Plot and Psychological maladies that are pure Hitchcockian. You could spend weeks reading up on the Film's nuances and find giddy Geek Writers wale endlessly on its meanings and double meanings, Doppelgangers and assorted dementia and neurosis. There are some who think this is dull, long, hammy, miscast, ridiculous, ludicrous, stiff, convoluted, and in the end not so much. But they would be in a very small minority. This is a Slow-Burner for sure, but beware, you might just get sucked into the Vortex, with its dizzying displays, morbid fascinations, and a nightmare ambiance.

    Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected-as I'm not the biggest fan of old movies- But not a great deal. I was rather confused throughout most the film. I did however like the story near more the beginning; the mystery around the whole madeleine character was rather intriguing, especially when the hotel housekeeper said she had not visited her room. I also liked how the audience saw the story threw Scotties eyes, not knowing about Judy until the flashback revealing everything. However I lost interest greatly when the flashback was shown as it answered the mystery of what was happening/happened to Madeleine (personally I would have kept the flashback till Scotty takes Judy to the tower) I think the Characters are a little boring, it took me a while to because interested and invested in the character, it did weird me out a bit when Scottie went a bit phyco and abusive towards Judy as he didn't seem to be that type of character up to that point. For the time it was made in I think the production values are very good, the only thing I thought was bad was whenever someone fell, it looked so bad but I could cope with it. I don't really think I would personally recommend it to my friends as it's not really a film they would be interested in. Nor do I think it's a film that really sticks out as memorable. For me personally I would not rate this in my top list of films. I would not class it in the worst films I've ever seen. It would probably be somewhere in the lower middle quarter. My main issue was it took too long to get into the main story line. I also don't understand why the nun scarred Judy so much, that was actually a little unrealistic. Although then again when I watched this alone I did get scared, but I mean if someone else was there I would not go slip off a building.

    Vertigo is like a roller-coaster. Not a good roller coaster, the type of roller coaster that takes half an hour to get up to the top and then when it finally gets to the first drop it starts to pick up speed before grinding to a sudden halt again. Vertigo was written by Alfred Hitchcock and released in theatres in 1958. The film is regarded as a classic and commonly seen as some of Hitchcock's best work, and honestly, after watching I can understand how people where able to come to this conclusion. The majority of the main cast is excellent, but the standout actor for me was certainly James Stewart plays our main character, John Ferguson, who deserves a large amount of praise for how convincingly he played his role throughout the film, as he changes from a sympathetic protagonist into a rather obsessive crazy psychopath driven by his grief throughout the film. The film overall has a very strong plot with numerous unpredictable twists throughout that I would not even dare spoil. However in many ways the movie's age shows. Nowhere is this clearer than in the dated special effects in the film and the incredibly cheesy soundtrack that many of the older Hitchcock films are known for. Personally I do not have a problem either of these, as I find these aspects add to the classic feeling of the film; however, I can see it putting off some potential viewers. The only problem I had with the film was, as I mentioned above, is the films pacing. The film starts incredibly slow and is rather boring for the first thirty minutes before it begins picking up pace, however it then grinds to a second halt later on after the courtroom scene for another half hour before it finally picks up again for the climax of the film. While I can certainly forgive this in some ways, since the film is very entertaining when it is going at a decent pace, I still felt that it was quite jarring at several points during the movie. Overall I did enjoy Vertigo lot despite some issues I had with the pacing, but even with that issue I still feel that the film is a very entertaining watch, due to its unpredictable plot and the strong performances delivered by the lead actors. It is due to this that I am willing to rate Vertigo as an 8/10.

    Vertigo was a film that was ahead of its time when it was released. Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there. Sure in 1958 this movie was full of suspense and thought provoking cinema however in this era it just seems dull and lacks the suspense needed to make it enjoyable. The fact this film is called a 'suspense thriller' is almost laughable. The film seems to meander around shots of walking and driving and stalking for a good 40 minutes, something which when the film didn't start that great in the first place doesn't help its cause. The storyline was fairly obvious as well, even for a simpleton like me to guess, in addition to the dull as ditch water dialogue (even at the time) that's teemed with it. The directing as I've mentioned is not to blame and the use of colours and sound are brilliant by Hitchcock but that cannot make up for Vertigo which promised so much and produced so very little on the big screen. I would recommend this film to Hitchcock fans but it is by no means his best film, not even close. The lack of suspense and boring storyline despite the cleverness of Hitchcock means this film has to have 5 stars

    Though I enjoyed this film I think at times it can be overrated by various critics and members of the public. I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not 'a timeless classic' as it is often called. The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending. The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending. Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard. Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.

    Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected-as I'm not the biggest fan of old movies- But not a great deal. I was rather confused throughout most the film. I did however like the story near more the beginning; the mystery around the whole madeleine character was rather intriguing, especially when the hotel housekeeper said she had not visited her room. I also liked how the audience saw the story threw Scotties eyes, not knowing about Judy until the flashback revealing everything. However I lost interest greatly when the flashback was shown as it answered the mystery of what was happening/happened to Madeleine (personally I would have kept the flashback till Scotty takes Judy to the tower) I think the Characters are a little boring, it took me a while to because interested and invested in the character, it did weird me out a bit when Scottie went a bit phyco and abusive towards Judy as he didn't seem to be that type of character up to that point. For the time it was made in I think the production values are very good, the only thing I thought was bad was whenever someone fell, it looked so bad but I could cope with it. I don't really think I would personally recommend it to my friends as it's not really a film they would be interested in. Nor do I think it's a film that really sticks out as memorable. For me personally I would not rate this in my top list of films. I would not class it in the worst films I've ever seen. It would probably be somewhere in the lower middle quarter. My main issue was it took too long to get into the main story line. I also don't understand why the nun scarred Judy so much, that was actually a little unrealistic. Although then again when I watched this alone I did get scared, but I mean if someone else was there I would not go slip off a building.

    Vertigo is like a roller-coaster. Not a good roller coaster, the type of roller coaster that takes half an hour to get up to the top and then when it finally gets to the first drop it starts to pick up speed before grinding to a sudden halt again. Vertigo was written by Alfred Hitchcock and released in theatres in 1958. The film is regarded as a classic and commonly seen as some of Hitchcock's best work, and honestly, after watching I can understand how people where able to come to this conclusion. The majority of the main cast is excellent, but the standout actor for me was certainly James Stewart plays our main character, John Ferguson, who deserves a large amount of praise for how convincingly he played his role throughout the film, as he changes from a sympathetic protagonist into a rather obsessive crazy psychopath driven by his grief throughout the film. The film overall has a very strong plot with numerous unpredictable twists throughout that I would not even dare spoil. However in many ways the movie's age shows. Nowhere is this clearer than in the dated special effects in the film and the incredibly cheesy soundtrack that many of the older Hitchcock films are known for. Personally I do not have a problem either of these, as I find these aspects add to the classic feeling of the film; however, I can see it putting off some potential viewers. The only problem I had with the film was, as I mentioned above, is the films pacing. The film starts incredibly slow and is rather boring for the first thirty minutes before it begins picking up pace, however it then grinds to a second halt later on after the courtroom scene for another half hour before it finally picks up again for the climax of the film. While I can certainly forgive this in some ways, since the film is very entertaining when it is going at a decent pace, I still felt that it was quite jarring at several points during the movie. Overall I did enjoy Vertigo lot despite some issues I had with the pacing, but even with that issue I still feel that the film is a very entertaining watch, due to its unpredictable plot and the strong performances delivered by the lead actors. It is due to this that I am willing to rate Vertigo as an 8/10.

    Vertigo was a film that was ahead of its time when it was released. Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there. Sure in 1958 this movie was full of suspense and thought provoking cinema however in this era it just seems dull and lacks the suspense needed to make it enjoyable. The fact this film is called a 'suspense thriller' is almost laughable. The film seems to meander around shots of walking and driving and stalking for a good 40 minutes, something which when the film didn't start that great in the first place doesn't help its cause. The storyline was fairly obvious as well, even for a simpleton like me to guess, in addition to the dull as ditch water dialogue (even at the time) that's teemed with it. The directing as I've mentioned is not to blame and the use of colours and sound are brilliant by Hitchcock but that cannot make up for Vertigo which promised so much and produced so very little on the big screen. I would recommend this film to Hitchcock fans but it is by no means his best film, not even close. The lack of suspense and boring storyline despite the cleverness of Hitchcock means this film has to have 5 stars

    Though I enjoyed this film I think at times it can be overrated by various critics and members of the public. I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not 'a timeless classic' as it is often called. The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending. The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending. Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard. Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.

    . . . and craven coward John "Scottie" Ferguson (played here by James Stewart, in perhaps the most reprehensible role during his long film career as the Tom Hanks of his day) sure as heck doesn't give two hoots about the woman he's tossing away like a used facial tissue, either. Nor does Judy-from-Kansas' previous sugar daddy, John's college chum Gavin, who has foisted her off upon John in an overly complicated plot to help himself to an ahead-of-its-time no-fault divorce. John, a completely amoral "whited sepulcher," has no qualms about putting it to Judy when she's masquerading as Gavin's troubled wife, Madeleine. But as soon as John realizes that he is NOT having kinky hand-me-down sex with Gavin's actual discarded spouse, he scrapes Judy out of his life like "Doggie Doo-Doo" on the bottom of his shoe, with the help of the Catholic Church in the guise of a nun who "thought she heard voices." The latter woman intones "God have mercy"--as surely no one on the Corrupt Coast ever had had when poor deluded Judy was still alive--to close out this overwrought "sex mystery" (to use director Alfred Hitchcock's later genre description of MARNIE). Judy\"Madeleine's" downfall was never realizing she was living among the morally bankrupt, and coming to grips with the fact that she definitely "was not in Kansas anymore"!

    Since nearly 600 people have already reviewed this film on IMDb, I was going to skip it. But, it's sucked me in, so here goes. First I have to say that I have a far different view of Hitchcock's career than do most. First, I don't like any of Hitchcock's pre-Hollywood films, and detest some of them (e.g., "Murder!"). Then, in 1940, with "Rebecca", he seems to break out of the British fog and the films are suddenly almost all terrific...if not brilliant (with a rare exception here and there; e.g., "Lifeboat". But then, suddenly, in 1960, for me it all falls apart with "Psycho". The film has some redeeming qualities in terms of scenes, but in general I don't see it as much more than a cheap slasher movie with a little more psychology tossed in. And "The Birds" is for the birds...cheap horror inspired by Rachel Carson's "A Silent Spring". I can sit through "Torn Curtain", but more due to the star quality than the film itself. In terms of "Vertigo", there seem to be two sticking points for many people. One is the age of Jimmy Stewart (50) and Kim Novak (25). First, this is similar in many pictures with many stars -- an older male star with a younger female star. The only place it ever really bothered me was with Gary Cooper (age 56) and Audrey Hepburn (age 28) in "Love In The Afternoon"; and then it was more about Cooper's haggard looks than the actual age difference. Here, Stewart is a rather young looking 50, and in my view, Novak plays a character more in her mid to later 30s, despite her real age. Consider the age of her husband in the film, the actor being 54 years old. The other catching point for some is the flashback scene about 1:40 into the film. Some think that the scene gives too much away, while others think it gives the film context. I watched for it in this, my third viewing of the film. I can take it either way, because in my view, in many films it's not where you're going that's as important as how you get there. A third thing sometimes criticized about the film is its length at 2:08. I don't see that as so long, and I rather like that Hitchcock lingered a bit with his scenes of San Francisco and some other locations. One thing I will criticize about many Hitchcock films is the cheapness of many of the scenes which he shot in front of a projection screen. It ruined "To Catch A Thief" for me, and is pretty bad in this film as well. Is this where he often tried to save money? Another thing about this film that is interesting to me is how it changes focus after the initial death of Novak's character. Up until then, the real focus has been on Novak, even though Stewart got more screen time and far more dialog. But after that initial death, the focus is even more on Stewart and his obsessions. That sudden change in focus is quite marvelous, although Stewart's obsession with the vertigo is clear in the beginning of the film...but later we see he is quite an obsessive character in many ways. One thing I am not clear on is the character played by Barbara Bel Geddes. I don't quite see the purpose...unless it is just a way to have Stewart bounce some ideas off of her. There are really only 5 actors worth mentioning in this film. I personally feel this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best roles. I'm very undecided overall about Kim Novak as an actress, but she was good here. I found Barbara Bel Geddes to be very comfortable on the screen; I wish she would have done more movie work, but I guess the blacklist soured her career for a while. Tom Helmore was good as the scheming husband; a dependable character actor. Henry Jones had a small role as the coroner, but I just love his voice inflections. The bottom line is -- is it a Hitchcock masterpiece. Although flawed, I would say yes, although not in his top 5, but somewhere in his top 10. Recommended.
