    first off I loved the uncredited role that Emilio Estevez had,, Jean Reno was awesome in a supporting role,, Hollywood tries the ultimate mission,, to re do the mission impossible series on TV in to a movie. Tom cruise plays the leader of the group Ethan Hunt.. his whole crew get's killed,, and their's a mole inside the department,, now on his own and with no one from the department to help him,, he must recruit some old friends if he wants to find out what really happened to his team and who killed them,, his is after a noc list, which is a list of agents,, code names ,, matched with their real names,, and if the bad guys get ahold of this list,, everyone will be in serious jeopardy,, not a bad action adventure,, I think for the most part Holllywood got it right..

    I've read reviews on here from die hard fans who knock this film. Some have even gone as far to rate it a 1? Are you kidding me? Its insanely difficult to make an okay movie. Damn near impossible to make a masterpiece! I think nostalgia is winning the day with the old fans of the show. The show was cool but let's face it..its not all that its now cracked up to be by the fans. It hasn't aged well at all and is hokey at times. the sequels to this film are a fun watch but ultimately crappy. Ill agree with that assessment. This film is superior to the sequels, however. I'm sorry, I disagree with the people that have a heightened sense of some somewhat cloudy nostalgia. I can understand. At least be fair, though. And Tom gets a bad rap from the older gen born in the 60s. I grew up as a child in the 80s and early 90s and from my perspective he is a fine actor and always gives it his all. I of course watched him as an impressionable child so my perspective will be different. Isn't that cool though. I'm sure people are justified in their not being fond of him. His ego I can imagine is quite huge considering he's been so privileged for so long. But we don't have to be friends with him do we? I think its cool that perspectives can be so different and its very telling. I say tom is worthwhile from where I've been sittin and I refuse to pass judgments on the man. This movie is great. Id rate it a 7.8 or 7.9 easily if I could. I don't know about an 8 so ill put down a strong 7 as my rating. Maybe ill change my mind.

    This movie combines pacing similar to Indiana Jones (that is, quick, each scene directly leading into the next) with the plotting of James Bond (that is, telling a fairly simple story in the most convoluted manner possible) to create a very entertaining experience. I know very little of the television series that it's based on, but this movie definitely stands alone. Despite a few callbacks (the self-destructing tape, Jim Phelps), the film introduces completely new characters. Even after a brilliant opening half hour, during which Tom Cruise, IMF agent becomes Tom Cruise, rogue ex-IMF agent, the film continues to bring in memorable characters and set pieces (and also fails to mention exactly what IMF stands for) The movie's best scene comes when Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, is infiltrating CIA headquarters. Like the rest of the film, it looks good and has great suspense, even if you can't think too much about it (if the room is, like, completely sealed, why can you use the computer without setting off the alarm?)

    I was anticipating this movie as I was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s. What a major disappointment this was. The film begins OK, But then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that Hollywood churns out so often. Cruse is totally miss-cast and unconvincing,the point of the series was it's cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things. This was just the biggest disappointment on film I have seen, apart from the even worse 2 follow ups. I am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film, but Mission Impossible it is not. And Jim Phelps turning traitor? Please!!!

    Sort of based off the TV show, Mission Impossible is an action packed movie filled with fun action, a good lead, and some tense moments that are very fun with a few twists. After the opening credits, the film starts with Jon Voight receiving a mission from IMF. He assembles his team to carryout the mission and they do, but when the team starts dying, they try to make a run for it, but all fail but Hunt (Cruise). Then for some reason IMF starts to think that he did this and he makes a run for it and it becomes Hunt against everyone else. The film has good action scenes that are very fun but one problem is that the story is very confusing and is hard to follow at times, but the action is so fun and pointless that we do not care. The film still has one of the most suspenseful scenes ever as Tom Cruise is to extract information from this highly secured computer and needs to do it before this man comes in for work. The scene gets extremely intense and is pretty incredible. Tom Cruise is fun as Ethan Hunt as Hunt is a fun character, but gets serious when on the job and is good at making the quick decision to get out of situations. The end is fun with Jon Voight being bad and I can't remember the reason why and then there are a bunch of other people in it too that Hunt becomes in touch with like Jon's wife and a man he meets on the way. The film is fun pointless action and should be watched at least twice before you get complete appreciation for it. Me: 4/5 Audience: 3.5/5

    Can you imagine seeing a Star Trek movie where Captain Kirk becomes a traitor? Or how about The cookie monster a child abuser, or Luke Skywalker becoming evil? What about Mr. Rogers on the 10 most wanted? That's the kind of nonsense this movie peddles. It is total garbage. And is not a mission impossible story at all. Sure the movie is fine but give it a different name and don't steal any themes from the true mission impossible story. If you are not a mission impossible fan you will find this movie exciting.....but not if you are a true Mission Impossible fan. This is worst then terrible, and obviously not written by someone who understood the series. Rather promoted using the IMF name, music, themes, but not the heart and soul of this great series. I can't imagine the outrage if they did this to Star Trek or had a sequel to the Walton's and now John Boy turns into a death row criminal. The fact someone tried this with our beloved series just goes to show that double espionage can be tried, but we know better and know this is not really mission impossible but an impostor!

    I cant believe they wasted one of the best TV shows EVER simply to make a vehicle for an increasingly geriatric Tom Cruise. and I cant believe that constant bulgy teary eyes, top-gun gape and all caps sentences every annoying moment of the movie is what defines good acting in Hollywood these days... sigh..... And what is there to "think" about in this movie?? Tom Cruise in starting frame. Tom Cruise gets double teamed. Tom Cruise gets mad. Tom Cruise gets teary eyed. Tom Cruise exclaims constantly (DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED!!!!!!!!!). Tom Cruise kills bad guy with a helicopter and a train. Tom Cruise saves the day. Tom Cruise in last frame. Has any Tom Cruise movie been any different?? I wish that helicopter blade had made those two extra inches...sigh.. would have made my day..

    (This review is heavy on spoilersbut it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet) Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission: Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on. And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused  I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses. Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins. The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before. Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT  or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously. And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it  the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off  just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc. Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette  the old 3&frac12; inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie. I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan "Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!" Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good  for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place. Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat  REALLY?  that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart. Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it. The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally. This actually very slow "action" movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience. "I've been disavowed," says Ethan. Don't worry: it won't be your last time.

    Mission: Impossible is a great movie with a well thought out story line,a great cast and plenty of action that will keep you interested from start to finish.Tom Cruise delivers a fantastic performance as Ethan Hunt,and its no surprise these movies are still going today.The story is slightly convoluted at times,but it can still be very exciting,and if you didn't like this movie,I would still recommend you check out the sequels,the second isn't a huge improvement,but the third is brilliant and the fourth one only gets better. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is framed for disloyalty of his organization,and must find out who the real spy is without there help.

    Mission: Impossible (1996) The is a taste thing, but I found this movie playing so hard with movie tricks and spy clich&eacute;s it became weirdly slow at times and weirdly irrelevant. You might say I wasn't supposed to much care about the characters in the twisting plot, but that's like saying they didn't really "intend" to make a great movie, so get over it. I didn't hate this by any means, I just expected more. I think I liked the third MI movie just because it took that ridiculous, high adventure stuff further. That said, there are totally fun and purposely outrageous scenes that almost make the rest of it worthwhile. Mainly, for me, the insane helicopter train chase. Ha. I laughed and had a good time with that. For those who know the MI movies this review is meant to raise the question--what is a movie like this supposed to achieve in the viewer? And how does it compare to the best of, to be obvious, the James Bond movies (I just saw "Skyfall," which for all its own flaws was better)? Or does it hold a candle to the really good Jason Bourne movies? (Not really, though the Bourne movies take themselves so so seriously, they occupy a different zone. James Bond always had a kind of detached humor which works well.) Brian DePalma is a director who knows most of all how to achieve effects. In this way the movie is wonderful--the angles for some simple confrontations, the changing camera angles throughout. His movies always replace substance with style, for sure, and yet the style is so overt and so attractive it almost becomes the substance. You can watch a DePalma movie just with your eyes. I'll admit once last problem I have here--I don't think much of Tom Cruise. He's a plastic caricature. He's not a bad actor, I suppose, but he lacks some kind of intensity or style or something (I'm think Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, or even Matt Damon for some kind of "persona" at work). He's a big part of the movie. My favorite actor/actress in this whole thing is the remarkable Kristin Scott Thomas, and she's in it for just a few minutes. Jon Voigt is always welcome, and does his job. Vanessa Redgrave frankly over does her part, but that's part of the DePalma excess. Fun stuff. In the end, fine, another scene where the weary survivors of an adventure sit and soak up normal cafe life. Take it as it comes. Not half bad, not half good.

You don't even kill him off  just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc. Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette  the old 3&frac12; inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie. I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan "Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!" Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good  for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place. Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat  REALLY?  that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart. Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it. The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally. This actually very slow "action" movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience. "I've been disavowed," says Ethan. Don't worry: it won't be your last time.

    Mission: Impossible is a great movie with a well thought out story line,a great cast and plenty of action that will keep you interested from start to finish.Tom Cruise delivers a fantastic performance as Ethan Hunt,and its no surprise these movies are still going today.The story is slightly convoluted at times,but it can still be very exciting,and if you didn't like this movie,I would still recommend you check out the sequels,the second isn't a huge improvement,but the third is brilliant and the fourth one only gets better. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is framed for disloyalty of his organization,and must find out who the real spy is without there help.

    Mission: Impossible (1996) The is a taste thing, but I found this movie playing so hard with movie tricks and spy clich&eacute;s it became weirdly slow at times and weirdly irrelevant. You might say I wasn't supposed to much care about the characters in the twisting plot, but that's like saying they didn't really "intend" to make a great movie, so get over it. I didn't hate this by any means, I just expected more. I think I liked the third MI movie just because it took that ridiculous, high adventure stuff further. That said, there are totally fun and purposely outrageous scenes that almost make the rest of it worthwhile. Mainly, for me, the insane helicopter train chase. Ha. I laughed and had a good time with that. For those who know the MI movies this review is meant to raise the question--what is a movie like this supposed to achieve in the viewer? And how does it compare to the best of, to be obvious, the James Bond movies (I just saw "Skyfall," which for all its own flaws was better)? Or does it hold a candle to the really good Jason Bourne movies? (Not really, though the Bourne movies take themselves so so seriously, they occupy a different zone. James Bond always had a kind of detached humor which works well.) Brian DePalma is a director who knows most of all how to achieve effects. In this way the movie is wonderful--the angles for some simple confrontations, the changing camera angles throughout. His movies always replace substance with style, for sure, and yet the style is so overt and so attractive it almost becomes the substance. You can watch a DePalma movie just with your eyes. I'll admit once last problem I have here--I don't think much of Tom Cruise. He's a plastic caricature. He's not a bad actor, I suppose, but he lacks some kind of intensity or style or something (I'm think Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, or even Matt Damon for some kind of "persona" at work). He's a big part of the movie. My favorite actor/actress in this whole thing is the remarkable Kristin Scott Thomas, and she's in it for just a few minutes. Jon Voigt is always welcome, and does his job. Vanessa Redgrave frankly over does her part, but that's part of the DePalma excess. Fun stuff. In the end, fine, another scene where the weary survivors of an adventure sit and soak up normal cafe life. Take it as it comes. Not half bad, not half good.

    first off I loved the uncredited role that Emilio Estevez had,, Jean Reno was awesome in a supporting role,, Hollywood tries the ultimate mission,, to re do the mission impossible series on TV in to a movie. Tom cruise plays the leader of the group Ethan Hunt.. his whole crew get's killed,, and their's a mole inside the department,, now on his own and with no one from the department to help him,, he must recruit some old friends if he wants to find out what really happened to his team and who killed them,, his is after a noc list, which is a list of agents,, code names ,, matched with their real names,, and if the bad guys get ahold of this list,, everyone will be in serious jeopardy,, not a bad action adventure,, I think for the most part Holllywood got it right..

    I've read reviews on here from die hard fans who knock this film. Some have even gone as far to rate it a 1? Are you kidding me? Its insanely difficult to make an okay movie. Damn near impossible to make a masterpiece! I think nostalgia is winning the day with the old fans of the show. The show was cool but let's face it..its not all that its now cracked up to be by the fans. It hasn't aged well at all and is hokey at times. the sequels to this film are a fun watch but ultimately crappy. Ill agree with that assessment. This film is superior to the sequels, however. I'm sorry, I disagree with the people that have a heightened sense of some somewhat cloudy nostalgia. I can understand. At least be fair, though. And Tom gets a bad rap from the older gen born in the 60s. I grew up as a child in the 80s and early 90s and from my perspective he is a fine actor and always gives it his all. I of course watched him as an impressionable child so my perspective will be different. Isn't that cool though. I'm sure people are justified in their not being fond of him. His ego I can imagine is quite huge considering he's been so privileged for so long. But we don't have to be friends with him do we? I think its cool that perspectives can be so different and its very telling. I say tom is worthwhile from where I've been sittin and I refuse to pass judgments on the man. This movie is great. Id rate it a 7.8 or 7.9 easily if I could. I don't know about an 8 so ill put down a strong 7 as my rating. Maybe ill change my mind.

    This movie combines pacing similar to Indiana Jones (that is, quick, each scene directly leading into the next) with the plotting of James Bond (that is, telling a fairly simple story in the most convoluted manner possible) to create a very entertaining experience. I know very little of the television series that it's based on, but this movie definitely stands alone. Despite a few callbacks (the self-destructing tape, Jim Phelps), the film introduces completely new characters. Even after a brilliant opening half hour, during which Tom Cruise, IMF agent becomes Tom Cruise, rogue ex-IMF agent, the film continues to bring in memorable characters and set pieces (and also fails to mention exactly what IMF stands for) The movie's best scene comes when Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, is infiltrating CIA headquarters. Like the rest of the film, it looks good and has great suspense, even if you can't think too much about it (if the room is, like, completely sealed, why can you use the computer without setting off the alarm?)

    I was anticipating this movie as I was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s. What a major disappointment this was. The film begins OK, But then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that Hollywood churns out so often. Cruse is totally miss-cast and unconvincing,the point of the series was it's cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things. This was just the biggest disappointment on film I have seen, apart from the even worse 2 follow ups. I am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film, but Mission Impossible it is not. And Jim Phelps turning traitor? Please!!!

    Sort of based off the TV show, Mission Impossible is an action packed movie filled with fun action, a good lead, and some tense moments that are very fun with a few twists. After the opening credits, the film starts with Jon Voight receiving a mission from IMF. He assembles his team to carryout the mission and they do, but when the team starts dying, they try to make a run for it, but all fail but Hunt (Cruise). Then for some reason IMF starts to think that he did this and he makes a run for it and it becomes Hunt against everyone else. The film has good action scenes that are very fun but one problem is that the story is very confusing and is hard to follow at times, but the action is so fun and pointless that we do not care. The film still has one of the most suspenseful scenes ever as Tom Cruise is to extract information from this highly secured computer and needs to do it before this man comes in for work. The scene gets extremely intense and is pretty incredible. Tom Cruise is fun as Ethan Hunt as Hunt is a fun character, but gets serious when on the job and is good at making the quick decision to get out of situations. The end is fun with Jon Voight being bad and I can't remember the reason why and then there are a bunch of other people in it too that Hunt becomes in touch with like Jon's wife and a man he meets on the way. The film is fun pointless action and should be watched at least twice before you get complete appreciation for it. Me: 4/5 Audience: 3.5/5

    Can you imagine seeing a Star Trek movie where Captain Kirk becomes a traitor? Or how about The cookie monster a child abuser, or Luke Skywalker becoming evil? What about Mr. Rogers on the 10 most wanted? That's the kind of nonsense this movie peddles. It is total garbage. And is not a mission impossible story at all. Sure the movie is fine but give it a different name and don't steal any themes from the true mission impossible story. If you are not a mission impossible fan you will find this movie exciting.....but not if you are a true Mission Impossible fan. This is worst then terrible, and obviously not written by someone who understood the series. Rather promoted using the IMF name, music, themes, but not the heart and soul of this great series. I can't imagine the outrage if they did this to Star Trek or had a sequel to the Walton's and now John Boy turns into a death row criminal. The fact someone tried this with our beloved series just goes to show that double espionage can be tried, but we know better and know this is not really mission impossible but an impostor!

    I cant believe they wasted one of the best TV shows EVER simply to make a vehicle for an increasingly geriatric Tom Cruise. and I cant believe that constant bulgy teary eyes, top-gun gape and all caps sentences every annoying moment of the movie is what defines good acting in Hollywood these days... sigh..... And what is there to "think" about in this movie?? Tom Cruise in starting frame. Tom Cruise gets double teamed. Tom Cruise gets mad. Tom Cruise gets teary eyed. Tom Cruise exclaims constantly (DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED!!!!!!!!!). Tom Cruise kills bad guy with a helicopter and a train. Tom Cruise saves the day. Tom Cruise in last frame. Has any Tom Cruise movie been any different?? I wish that helicopter blade had made those two extra inches...sigh.. would have made my day..

    (This review is heavy on spoilersbut it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet) Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission: Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on. And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused  I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses. Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins. The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before. Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT  or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously. And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it  the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off  just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc. Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette  the old 3&frac12; inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie. I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan "Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!" Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good  for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place. Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat  REALLY?  that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart. Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it. The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally.

If you are not a mission impossible fan you will find this movie exciting.....but not if you are a true Mission Impossible fan. This is worst then terrible, and obviously not written by someone who understood the series. Rather promoted using the IMF name, music, themes, but not the heart and soul of this great series. I can't imagine the outrage if they did this to Star Trek or had a sequel to the Walton's and now John Boy turns into a death row criminal. The fact someone tried this with our beloved series just goes to show that double espionage can be tried, but we know better and know this is not really mission impossible but an impostor!

    I cant believe they wasted one of the best TV shows EVER simply to make a vehicle for an increasingly geriatric Tom Cruise. and I cant believe that constant bulgy teary eyes, top-gun gape and all caps sentences every annoying moment of the movie is what defines good acting in Hollywood these days... sigh..... And what is there to "think" about in this movie?? Tom Cruise in starting frame. Tom Cruise gets double teamed. Tom Cruise gets mad. Tom Cruise gets teary eyed. Tom Cruise exclaims constantly (DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED!!!!!!!!!). Tom Cruise kills bad guy with a helicopter and a train. Tom Cruise saves the day. Tom Cruise in last frame. Has any Tom Cruise movie been any different?? I wish that helicopter blade had made those two extra inches...sigh.. would have made my day..

    (This review is heavy on spoilersbut it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet) Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission: Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on. And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused  I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses. Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins. The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before. Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT  or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously. And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it  the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off  just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc. Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette  the old 3&frac12; inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie. I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan "Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!" Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good  for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place. Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat  REALLY?  that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart. Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it. The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally. This actually very slow "action" movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience. "I've been disavowed," says Ethan. Don't worry: it won't be your last time.

    Mission: Impossible is a great movie with a well thought out story line,a great cast and plenty of action that will keep you interested from start to finish.Tom Cruise delivers a fantastic performance as Ethan Hunt,and its no surprise these movies are still going today.The story is slightly convoluted at times,but it can still be very exciting,and if you didn't like this movie,I would still recommend you check out the sequels,the second isn't a huge improvement,but the third is brilliant and the fourth one only gets better. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is framed for disloyalty of his organization,and must find out who the real spy is without there help.

    Mission: Impossible (1996) The is a taste thing, but I found this movie playing so hard with movie tricks and spy clich&eacute;s it became weirdly slow at times and weirdly irrelevant. You might say I wasn't supposed to much care about the characters in the twisting plot, but that's like saying they didn't really "intend" to make a great movie, so get over it. I didn't hate this by any means, I just expected more. I think I liked the third MI movie just because it took that ridiculous, high adventure stuff further. That said, there are totally fun and purposely outrageous scenes that almost make the rest of it worthwhile. Mainly, for me, the insane helicopter train chase. Ha. I laughed and had a good time with that. For those who know the MI movies this review is meant to raise the question--what is a movie like this supposed to achieve in the viewer? And how does it compare to the best of, to be obvious, the James Bond movies (I just saw "Skyfall," which for all its own flaws was better)? Or does it hold a candle to the really good Jason Bourne movies? (Not really, though the Bourne movies take themselves so so seriously, they occupy a different zone. James Bond always had a kind of detached humor which works well.) Brian DePalma is a director who knows most of all how to achieve effects. In this way the movie is wonderful--the angles for some simple confrontations, the changing camera angles throughout. His movies always replace substance with style, for sure, and yet the style is so overt and so attractive it almost becomes the substance. You can watch a DePalma movie just with your eyes. I'll admit once last problem I have here--I don't think much of Tom Cruise. He's a plastic caricature. He's not a bad actor, I suppose, but he lacks some kind of intensity or style or something (I'm think Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, or even Matt Damon for some kind of "persona" at work). He's a big part of the movie. My favorite actor/actress in this whole thing is the remarkable Kristin Scott Thomas, and she's in it for just a few minutes. Jon Voigt is always welcome, and does his job. Vanessa Redgrave frankly over does her part, but that's part of the DePalma excess. Fun stuff. In the end, fine, another scene where the weary survivors of an adventure sit and soak up normal cafe life. Take it as it comes. Not half bad, not half good.

    first off I loved the uncredited role that Emilio Estevez had,, Jean Reno was awesome in a supporting role,, Hollywood tries the ultimate mission,, to re do the mission impossible series on TV in to a movie. Tom cruise plays the leader of the group Ethan Hunt.. his whole crew get's killed,, and their's a mole inside the department,, now on his own and with no one from the department to help him,, he must recruit some old friends if he wants to find out what really happened to his team and who killed them,, his is after a noc list, which is a list of agents,, code names ,, matched with their real names,, and if the bad guys get ahold of this list,, everyone will be in serious jeopardy,, not a bad action adventure,, I think for the most part Holllywood got it right..

    I've read reviews on here from die hard fans who knock this film. Some have even gone as far to rate it a 1? Are you kidding me? Its insanely difficult to make an okay movie. Damn near impossible to make a masterpiece! I think nostalgia is winning the day with the old fans of the show. The show was cool but let's face it..its not all that its now cracked up to be by the fans. It hasn't aged well at all and is hokey at times. the sequels to this film are a fun watch but ultimately crappy. Ill agree with that assessment. This film is superior to the sequels, however. I'm sorry, I disagree with the people that have a heightened sense of some somewhat cloudy nostalgia. I can understand. At least be fair, though. And Tom gets a bad rap from the older gen born in the 60s. I grew up as a child in the 80s and early 90s and from my perspective he is a fine actor and always gives it his all. I of course watched him as an impressionable child so my perspective will be different. Isn't that cool though. I'm sure people are justified in their not being fond of him. His ego I can imagine is quite huge considering he's been so privileged for so long. But we don't have to be friends with him do we? I think its cool that perspectives can be so different and its very telling. I say tom is worthwhile from where I've been sittin and I refuse to pass judgments on the man. This movie is great. Id rate it a 7.8 or 7.9 easily if I could. I don't know about an 8 so ill put down a strong 7 as my rating. Maybe ill change my mind.

    This movie combines pacing similar to Indiana Jones (that is, quick, each scene directly leading into the next) with the plotting of James Bond (that is, telling a fairly simple story in the most convoluted manner possible) to create a very entertaining experience. I know very little of the television series that it's based on, but this movie definitely stands alone. Despite a few callbacks (the self-destructing tape, Jim Phelps), the film introduces completely new characters. Even after a brilliant opening half hour, during which Tom Cruise, IMF agent becomes Tom Cruise, rogue ex-IMF agent, the film continues to bring in memorable characters and set pieces (and also fails to mention exactly what IMF stands for) The movie's best scene comes when Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, is infiltrating CIA headquarters. Like the rest of the film, it looks good and has great suspense, even if you can't think too much about it (if the room is, like, completely sealed, why can you use the computer without setting off the alarm?)

    I was anticipating this movie as I was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s. What a major disappointment this was. The film begins OK, But then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that Hollywood churns out so often. Cruse is totally miss-cast and unconvincing,the point of the series was it's cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things. This was just the biggest disappointment on film I have seen, apart from the even worse 2 follow ups. I am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film, but Mission Impossible it is not. And Jim Phelps turning traitor? Please!!!

    Sort of based off the TV show, Mission Impossible is an action packed movie filled with fun action, a good lead, and some tense moments that are very fun with a few twists. After the opening credits, the film starts with Jon Voight receiving a mission from IMF. He assembles his team to carryout the mission and they do, but when the team starts dying, they try to make a run for it, but all fail but Hunt (Cruise). Then for some reason IMF starts to think that he did this and he makes a run for it and it becomes Hunt against everyone else. The film has good action scenes that are very fun but one problem is that the story is very confusing and is hard to follow at times, but the action is so fun and pointless that we do not care. The film still has one of the most suspenseful scenes ever as Tom Cruise is to extract information from this highly secured computer and needs to do it before this man comes in for work. The scene gets extremely intense and is pretty incredible. Tom Cruise is fun as Ethan Hunt as Hunt is a fun character, but gets serious when on the job and is good at making the quick decision to get out of situations. The end is fun with Jon Voight being bad and I can't remember the reason why and then there are a bunch of other people in it too that Hunt becomes in touch with like Jon's wife and a man he meets on the way. The film is fun pointless action and should be watched at least twice before you get complete appreciation for it. Me: 4/5 Audience: 3.5/5

    Can you imagine seeing a Star Trek movie where Captain Kirk becomes a traitor? Or how about The cookie monster a child abuser, or Luke Skywalker becoming evil? What about Mr. Rogers on the 10 most wanted? That's the kind of nonsense this movie peddles. It is total garbage. And is not a mission impossible story at all. Sure the movie is fine but give it a different name and don't steal any themes from the true mission impossible story.

Like the rest of the film, it looks good and has great suspense, even if you can't think too much about it (if the room is, like, completely sealed, why can you use the computer without setting off the alarm?)

    I was anticipating this movie as I was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s. What a major disappointment this was. The film begins OK, But then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that Hollywood churns out so often. Cruse is totally miss-cast and unconvincing,the point of the series was it's cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things. This was just the biggest disappointment on film I have seen, apart from the even worse 2 follow ups. I am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film, but Mission Impossible it is not. And Jim Phelps turning traitor? Please!!!

    Sort of based off the TV show, Mission Impossible is an action packed movie filled with fun action, a good lead, and some tense moments that are very fun with a few twists. After the opening credits, the film starts with Jon Voight receiving a mission from IMF. He assembles his team to carryout the mission and they do, but when the team starts dying, they try to make a run for it, but all fail but Hunt (Cruise). Then for some reason IMF starts to think that he did this and he makes a run for it and it becomes Hunt against everyone else. The film has good action scenes that are very fun but one problem is that the story is very confusing and is hard to follow at times, but the action is so fun and pointless that we do not care. The film still has one of the most suspenseful scenes ever as Tom Cruise is to extract information from this highly secured computer and needs to do it before this man comes in for work. The scene gets extremely intense and is pretty incredible. Tom Cruise is fun as Ethan Hunt as Hunt is a fun character, but gets serious when on the job and is good at making the quick decision to get out of situations. The end is fun with Jon Voight being bad and I can't remember the reason why and then there are a bunch of other people in it too that Hunt becomes in touch with like Jon's wife and a man he meets on the way. The film is fun pointless action and should be watched at least twice before you get complete appreciation for it. Me: 4/5 Audience: 3.5/5

    Can you imagine seeing a Star Trek movie where Captain Kirk becomes a traitor? Or how about The cookie monster a child abuser, or Luke Skywalker becoming evil? What about Mr. Rogers on the 10 most wanted? That's the kind of nonsense this movie peddles. It is total garbage. And is not a mission impossible story at all. Sure the movie is fine but give it a different name and don't steal any themes from the true mission impossible story. If you are not a mission impossible fan you will find this movie exciting.....but not if you are a true Mission Impossible fan. This is worst then terrible, and obviously not written by someone who understood the series. Rather promoted using the IMF name, music, themes, but not the heart and soul of this great series. I can't imagine the outrage if they did this to Star Trek or had a sequel to the Walton's and now John Boy turns into a death row criminal. The fact someone tried this with our beloved series just goes to show that double espionage can be tried, but we know better and know this is not really mission impossible but an impostor!

    I cant believe they wasted one of the best TV shows EVER simply to make a vehicle for an increasingly geriatric Tom Cruise. and I cant believe that constant bulgy teary eyes, top-gun gape and all caps sentences every annoying moment of the movie is what defines good acting in Hollywood these days... sigh..... And what is there to "think" about in this movie?? Tom Cruise in starting frame. Tom Cruise gets double teamed. Tom Cruise gets mad. Tom Cruise gets teary eyed. Tom Cruise exclaims constantly (DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED!!!!!!!!!). Tom Cruise kills bad guy with a helicopter and a train. Tom Cruise saves the day. Tom Cruise in last frame. Has any Tom Cruise movie been any different?? I wish that helicopter blade had made those two extra inches...sigh.. would have made my day..

    (This review is heavy on spoilersbut it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet) Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission: Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on. And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused  I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses. Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins. The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before. Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT  or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously. And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it  the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off  just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc. Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette  the old 3&frac12; inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie. I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan "Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!" Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good  for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place. Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat  REALLY?  that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart. Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it. The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally. This actually very slow "action" movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience. "I've been disavowed," says Ethan. Don't worry: it won't be your last time.

    Mission: Impossible is a great movie with a well thought out story line,a great cast and plenty of action that will keep you interested from start to finish.Tom Cruise delivers a fantastic performance as Ethan Hunt,and its no surprise these movies are still going today.The story is slightly convoluted at times,but it can still be very exciting,and if you didn't like this movie,I would still recommend you check out the sequels,the second isn't a huge improvement,but the third is brilliant and the fourth one only gets better. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is framed for disloyalty of his organization,and must find out who the real spy is without there help.

    Mission: Impossible (1996) The is a taste thing, but I found this movie playing so hard with movie tricks and spy clich&eacute;s it became weirdly slow at times and weirdly irrelevant. You might say I wasn't supposed to much care about the characters in the twisting plot, but that's like saying they didn't really "intend" to make a great movie, so get over it. I didn't hate this by any means, I just expected more. I think I liked the third MI movie just because it took that ridiculous, high adventure stuff further. That said, there are totally fun and purposely outrageous scenes that almost make the rest of it worthwhile. Mainly, for me, the insane helicopter train chase. Ha. I laughed and had a good time with that. For those who know the MI movies this review is meant to raise the question--what is a movie like this supposed to achieve in the viewer? And how does it compare to the best of, to be obvious, the James Bond movies (I just saw "Skyfall," which for all its own flaws was better)? Or does it hold a candle to the really good Jason Bourne movies? (Not really, though the Bourne movies take themselves so so seriously, they occupy a different zone. James Bond always had a kind of detached humor which works well.) Brian DePalma is a director who knows most of all how to achieve effects. In this way the movie is wonderful--the angles for some simple confrontations, the changing camera angles throughout. His movies always replace substance with style, for sure, and yet the style is so overt and so attractive it almost becomes the substance. You can watch a DePalma movie just with your eyes. I'll admit once last problem I have here--I don't think much of Tom Cruise. He's a plastic caricature. He's not a bad actor, I suppose, but he lacks some kind of intensity or style or something (I'm think Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, or even Matt Damon for some kind of "persona" at work). He's a big part of the movie. My favorite actor/actress in this whole thing is the remarkable Kristin Scott Thomas, and she's in it for just a few minutes. Jon Voigt is always welcome, and does his job. Vanessa Redgrave frankly over does her part, but that's part of the DePalma excess. Fun stuff. In the end, fine, another scene where the weary survivors of an adventure sit and soak up normal cafe life. Take it as it comes. Not half bad, not half good.

    first off I loved the uncredited role that Emilio Estevez had,, Jean Reno was awesome in a supporting role,, Hollywood tries the ultimate mission,, to re do the mission impossible series on TV in to a movie. Tom cruise plays the leader of the group Ethan Hunt.. his whole crew get's killed,, and their's a mole inside the department,, now on his own and with no one from the department to help him,, he must recruit some old friends if he wants to find out what really happened to his team and who killed them,, his is after a noc list, which is a list of agents,, code names ,, matched with their real names,, and if the bad guys get ahold of this list,, everyone will be in serious jeopardy,, not a bad action adventure,, I think for the most part Holllywood got it right..

    I've read reviews on here from die hard fans who knock this film. Some have even gone as far to rate it a 1? Are you kidding me? Its insanely difficult to make an okay movie. Damn near impossible to make a masterpiece! I think nostalgia is winning the day with the old fans of the show. The show was cool but let's face it..its not all that its now cracked up to be by the fans. It hasn't aged well at all and is hokey at times. the sequels to this film are a fun watch but ultimately crappy. Ill agree with that assessment. This film is superior to the sequels, however. I'm sorry, I disagree with the people that have a heightened sense of some somewhat cloudy nostalgia. I can understand. At least be fair, though. And Tom gets a bad rap from the older gen born in the 60s. I grew up as a child in the 80s and early 90s and from my perspective he is a fine actor and always gives it his all. I of course watched him as an impressionable child so my perspective will be different. Isn't that cool though. I'm sure people are justified in their not being fond of him. His ego I can imagine is quite huge considering he's been so privileged for so long. But we don't have to be friends with him do we? I think its cool that perspectives can be so different and its very telling. I say tom is worthwhile from where I've been sittin and I refuse to pass judgments on the man. This movie is great. Id rate it a 7.8 or 7.9 easily if I could. I don't know about an 8 so ill put down a strong 7 as my rating. Maybe ill change my mind.

    This movie combines pacing similar to Indiana Jones (that is, quick, each scene directly leading into the next) with the plotting of James Bond (that is, telling a fairly simple story in the most convoluted manner possible) to create a very entertaining experience. I know very little of the television series that it's based on, but this movie definitely stands alone. Despite a few callbacks (the self-destructing tape, Jim Phelps), the film introduces completely new characters. Even after a brilliant opening half hour, during which Tom Cruise, IMF agent becomes Tom Cruise, rogue ex-IMF agent, the film continues to bring in memorable characters and set pieces (and also fails to mention exactly what IMF stands for) The movie's best scene comes when Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, is infiltrating CIA headquarters. Like the rest of the film, it looks good and has great suspense, even if you can't think too much about it (if the room is, like, completely sealed, why can you use the computer without setting off the alarm?)

    first off I loved the uncredited role that Emilio Estevez had,, Jean Reno was awesome in a supporting role,, Hollywood tries the ultimate mission,, to re do the mission impossible series on TV in to a movie. Tom cruise plays the leader of the group Ethan Hunt.. his whole crew get's killed,, and their's a mole inside the department,, now on his own and with no one from the department to help him,, he must recruit some old friends if he wants to find out what really happened to his team and who killed them,, his is after a noc list, which is a list of agents,, code names ,, matched with their real names,, and if the bad guys get ahold of this list,, everyone will be in serious jeopardy,, not a bad action adventure,, I think for the most part Holllywood got it right..

    I've read reviews on here from die hard fans who knock this film. Some have even gone as far to rate it a 1? Are you kidding me? Its insanely difficult to make an okay movie. Damn near impossible to make a masterpiece! I think nostalgia is winning the day with the old fans of the show. The show was cool but let's face it..its not all that its now cracked up to be by the fans. It hasn't aged well at all and is hokey at times. the sequels to this film are a fun watch but ultimately crappy. Ill agree with that assessment. This film is superior to the sequels, however. I'm sorry, I disagree with the people that have a heightened sense of some somewhat cloudy nostalgia. I can understand. At least be fair, though. And Tom gets a bad rap from the older gen born in the 60s. I grew up as a child in the 80s and early 90s and from my perspective he is a fine actor and always gives it his all. I of course watched him as an impressionable child so my perspective will be different. Isn't that cool though. I'm sure people are justified in their not being fond of him. His ego I can imagine is quite huge considering he's been so privileged for so long. But we don't have to be friends with him do we? I think its cool that perspectives can be so different and its very telling. I say tom is worthwhile from where I've been sittin and I refuse to pass judgments on the man. This movie is great. Id rate it a 7.8 or 7.9 easily if I could. I don't know about an 8 so ill put down a strong 7 as my rating. Maybe ill change my mind.

    This movie combines pacing similar to Indiana Jones (that is, quick, each scene directly leading into the next) with the plotting of James Bond (that is, telling a fairly simple story in the most convoluted manner possible) to create a very entertaining experience. I know very little of the television series that it's based on, but this movie definitely stands alone. Despite a few callbacks (the self-destructing tape, Jim Phelps), the film introduces completely new characters. Even after a brilliant opening half hour, during which Tom Cruise, IMF agent becomes Tom Cruise, rogue ex-IMF agent, the film continues to bring in memorable characters and set pieces (and also fails to mention exactly what IMF stands for) The movie's best scene comes when Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, is infiltrating CIA headquarters. Like the rest of the film, it looks good and has great suspense, even if you can't think too much about it (if the room is, like, completely sealed, why can you use the computer without setting off the alarm?)

    I was anticipating this movie as I was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s. What a major disappointment this was. The film begins OK, But then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that Hollywood churns out so often. Cruse is totally miss-cast and unconvincing,the point of the series was it's cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things. This was just the biggest disappointment on film I have seen, apart from the even worse 2 follow ups. I am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film, but Mission Impossible it is not. And Jim Phelps turning traitor? Please!!!

    Sort of based off the TV show, Mission Impossible is an action packed movie filled with fun action, a good lead, and some tense moments that are very fun with a few twists. After the opening credits, the film starts with Jon Voight receiving a mission from IMF. He assembles his team to carryout the mission and they do, but when the team starts dying, they try to make a run for it, but all fail but Hunt (Cruise). Then for some reason IMF starts to think that he did this and he makes a run for it and it becomes Hunt against everyone else. The film has good action scenes that are very fun but one problem is that the story is very confusing and is hard to follow at times, but the action is so fun and pointless that we do not care. The film still has one of the most suspenseful scenes ever as Tom Cruise is to extract information from this highly secured computer and needs to do it before this man comes in for work. The scene gets extremely intense and is pretty incredible. Tom Cruise is fun as Ethan Hunt as Hunt is a fun character, but gets serious when on the job and is good at making the quick decision to get out of situations. The end is fun with Jon Voight being bad and I can't remember the reason why and then there are a bunch of other people in it too that Hunt becomes in touch with like Jon's wife and a man he meets on the way. The film is fun pointless action and should be watched at least twice before you get complete appreciation for it. Me: 4/5 Audience: 3.5/5

    Can you imagine seeing a Star Trek movie where Captain Kirk becomes a traitor? Or how about The cookie monster a child abuser, or Luke Skywalker becoming evil? What about Mr. Rogers on the 10 most wanted? That's the kind of nonsense this movie peddles. It is total garbage. And is not a mission impossible story at all. Sure the movie is fine but give it a different name and don't steal any themes from the true mission impossible story. If you are not a mission impossible fan you will find this movie exciting.....but not if you are a true Mission Impossible fan. This is worst then terrible, and obviously not written by someone who understood the series. Rather promoted using the IMF name, music, themes, but not the heart and soul of this great series. I can't imagine the outrage if they did this to Star Trek or had a sequel to the Walton's and now John Boy turns into a death row criminal. The fact someone tried this with our beloved series just goes to show that double espionage can be tried, but we know better and know this is not really mission impossible but an impostor!

    I cant believe they wasted one of the best TV shows EVER simply to make a vehicle for an increasingly geriatric Tom Cruise. and I cant believe that constant bulgy teary eyes, top-gun gape and all caps sentences every annoying moment of the movie is what defines good acting in Hollywood these days... sigh..... And what is there to "think" about in this movie?? Tom Cruise in starting frame. Tom Cruise gets double teamed. Tom Cruise gets mad. Tom Cruise gets teary eyed. Tom Cruise exclaims constantly (DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED!!!!!!!!!). Tom Cruise kills bad guy with a helicopter and a train. Tom Cruise saves the day. Tom Cruise in last frame. Has any Tom Cruise movie been any different?? I wish that helicopter blade had made those two extra inches...sigh.. would have made my day..

    (This review is heavy on spoilersbut it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet) Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission: Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on. And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused  I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses. Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins. The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before. Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT  or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously. And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it  the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off  just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc. Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette  the old 3&frac12; inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie. I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan "Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!" Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good  for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place. Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat  REALLY?  that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart. Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it. The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally. This actually very slow "action" movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience. "I've been disavowed," says Ethan. Don't worry: it won't be your last time.

    Mission: Impossible is a great movie with a well thought out story line,a great cast and plenty of action that will keep you interested from start to finish.Tom Cruise delivers a fantastic performance as Ethan Hunt,and its no surprise these movies are still going today.The story is slightly convoluted at times,but it can still be very exciting,and if you didn't like this movie,I would still recommend you check out the sequels,the second isn't a huge improvement,but the third is brilliant and the fourth one only gets better. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is framed for disloyalty of his organization,and must find out who the real spy is without there help.

    Mission: Impossible (1996) The is a taste thing, but I found this movie playing so hard with movie tricks and spy clich&eacute;s it became weirdly slow at times and weirdly irrelevant. You might say I wasn't supposed to much care about the characters in the twisting plot, but that's like saying they didn't really "intend" to make a great movie, so get over it. I didn't hate this by any means, I just expected more. I think I liked the third MI movie just because it took that ridiculous, high adventure stuff further. That said, there are totally fun and purposely outrageous scenes that almost make the rest of it worthwhile. Mainly, for me, the insane helicopter train chase. Ha. I laughed and had a good time with that. For those who know the MI movies this review is meant to raise the question--what is a movie like this supposed to achieve in the viewer? And how does it compare to the best of, to be obvious, the James Bond movies (I just saw "Skyfall," which for all its own flaws was better)? Or does it hold a candle to the really good Jason Bourne movies? (Not really, though the Bourne movies take themselves so so seriously, they occupy a different zone. James Bond always had a kind of detached humor which works well.) Brian DePalma is a director who knows most of all how to achieve effects. In this way the movie is wonderful--the angles for some simple confrontations, the changing camera angles throughout. His movies always replace substance with style, for sure, and yet the style is so overt and so attractive it almost becomes the substance. You can watch a DePalma movie just with your eyes. I'll admit once last problem I have here--I don't think much of Tom Cruise. He's a plastic caricature. He's not a bad actor, I suppose, but he lacks some kind of intensity or style or something (I'm think Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, or even Matt Damon for some kind of "persona" at work). He's a big part of the movie. My favorite actor/actress in this whole thing is the remarkable Kristin Scott Thomas, and she's in it for just a few minutes. Jon Voigt is always welcome, and does his job. Vanessa Redgrave frankly over does her part, but that's part of the DePalma excess. Fun stuff. In the end, fine, another scene where the weary survivors of an adventure sit and soak up normal cafe life. Take it as it comes. Not half bad, not half good.

    Mission: Impossible is a great movie with a well thought out story line,a great cast and plenty of action that will keep you interested from start to finish.Tom Cruise delivers a fantastic performance as Ethan Hunt,and its no surprise these movies are still going today.The story is slightly convoluted at times,but it can still be very exciting,and if you didn't like this movie,I would still recommend you check out the sequels,the second isn't a huge improvement,but the third is brilliant and the fourth one only gets better. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is framed for disloyalty of his organization,and must find out who the real spy is without there help.

    Mission: Impossible (1996) The is a taste thing, but I found this movie playing so hard with movie tricks and spy clich&eacute;s it became weirdly slow at times and weirdly irrelevant. You might say I wasn't supposed to much care about the characters in the twisting plot, but that's like saying they didn't really "intend" to make a great movie, so get over it. I didn't hate this by any means, I just expected more. I think I liked the third MI movie just because it took that ridiculous, high adventure stuff further. That said, there are totally fun and purposely outrageous scenes that almost make the rest of it worthwhile. Mainly, for me, the insane helicopter train chase. Ha. I laughed and had a good time with that. For those who know the MI movies this review is meant to raise the question--what is a movie like this supposed to achieve in the viewer? And how does it compare to the best of, to be obvious, the James Bond movies (I just saw "Skyfall," which for all its own flaws was better)? Or does it hold a candle to the really good Jason Bourne movies? (Not really, though the Bourne movies take themselves so so seriously, they occupy a different zone. James Bond always had a kind of detached humor which works well.) Brian DePalma is a director who knows most of all how to achieve effects. In this way the movie is wonderful--the angles for some simple confrontations, the changing camera angles throughout. His movies always replace substance with style, for sure, and yet the style is so overt and so attractive it almost becomes the substance. You can watch a DePalma movie just with your eyes. I'll admit once last problem I have here--I don't think much of Tom Cruise. He's a plastic caricature. He's not a bad actor, I suppose, but he lacks some kind of intensity or style or something (I'm think Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, or even Matt Damon for some kind of "persona" at work). He's a big part of the movie. My favorite actor/actress in this whole thing is the remarkable Kristin Scott Thomas, and she's in it for just a few minutes. Jon Voigt is always welcome, and does his job. Vanessa Redgrave frankly over does her part, but that's part of the DePalma excess. Fun stuff. In the end, fine, another scene where the weary survivors of an adventure sit and soak up normal cafe life. Take it as it comes. Not half bad, not half good.

    first off I loved the uncredited role that Emilio Estevez had,, Jean Reno was awesome in a supporting role,, Hollywood tries the ultimate mission,, to re do the mission impossible series on TV in to a movie. Tom cruise plays the leader of the group Ethan Hunt.. his whole crew get's killed,, and their's a mole inside the department,, now on his own and with no one from the department to help him,, he must recruit some old friends if he wants to find out what really happened to his team and who killed them,, his is after a noc list, which is a list of agents,, code names ,, matched with their real names,, and if the bad guys get ahold of this list,, everyone will be in serious jeopardy,, not a bad action adventure,, I think for the most part Holllywood got it right..

    I've read reviews on here from die hard fans who knock this film. Some have even gone as far to rate it a 1? Are you kidding me? Its insanely difficult to make an okay movie. Damn near impossible to make a masterpiece! I think nostalgia is winning the day with the old fans of the show. The show was cool but let's face it..its not all that its now cracked up to be by the fans. It hasn't aged well at all and is hokey at times. the sequels to this film are a fun watch but ultimately crappy. Ill agree with that assessment. This film is superior to the sequels, however. I'm sorry, I disagree with the people that have a heightened sense of some somewhat cloudy nostalgia. I can understand. At least be fair, though. And Tom gets a bad rap from the older gen born in the 60s. I grew up as a child in the 80s and early 90s and from my perspective he is a fine actor and always gives it his all. I of course watched him as an impressionable child so my perspective will be different. Isn't that cool though. I'm sure people are justified in their not being fond of him. His ego I can imagine is quite huge considering he's been so privileged for so long. But we don't have to be friends with him do we? I think its cool that perspectives can be so different and its very telling. I say tom is worthwhile from where I've been sittin and I refuse to pass judgments on the man. This movie is great. Id rate it a 7.8 or 7.9 easily if I could. I don't know about an 8 so ill put down a strong 7 as my rating. Maybe ill change my mind.

    This movie combines pacing similar to Indiana Jones (that is, quick, each scene directly leading into the next) with the plotting of James Bond (that is, telling a fairly simple story in the most convoluted manner possible) to create a very entertaining experience. I know very little of the television series that it's based on, but this movie definitely stands alone. Despite a few callbacks (the self-destructing tape, Jim Phelps), the film introduces completely new characters. Even after a brilliant opening half hour, during which Tom Cruise, IMF agent becomes Tom Cruise, rogue ex-IMF agent, the film continues to bring in memorable characters and set pieces (and also fails to mention exactly what IMF stands for) The movie's best scene comes when Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, is infiltrating CIA headquarters. Like the rest of the film, it looks good and has great suspense, even if you can't think too much about it (if the room is, like, completely sealed, why can you use the computer without setting off the alarm?)

    I was anticipating this movie as I was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s. What a major disappointment this was. The film begins OK, But then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that Hollywood churns out so often. Cruse is totally miss-cast and unconvincing,the point of the series was it's cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things. This was just the biggest disappointment on film I have seen, apart from the even worse 2 follow ups. I am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film, but Mission Impossible it is not. And Jim Phelps turning traitor? Please!!!

    Sort of based off the TV show, Mission Impossible is an action packed movie filled with fun action, a good lead, and some tense moments that are very fun with a few twists. After the opening credits, the film starts with Jon Voight receiving a mission from IMF. He assembles his team to carryout the mission and they do, but when the team starts dying, they try to make a run for it, but all fail but Hunt (Cruise). Then for some reason IMF starts to think that he did this and he makes a run for it and it becomes Hunt against everyone else. The film has good action scenes that are very fun but one problem is that the story is very confusing and is hard to follow at times, but the action is so fun and pointless that we do not care. The film still has one of the most suspenseful scenes ever as Tom Cruise is to extract information from this highly secured computer and needs to do it before this man comes in for work. The scene gets extremely intense and is pretty incredible. Tom Cruise is fun as Ethan Hunt as Hunt is a fun character, but gets serious when on the job and is good at making the quick decision to get out of situations. The end is fun with Jon Voight being bad and I can't remember the reason why and then there are a bunch of other people in it too that Hunt becomes in touch with like Jon's wife and a man he meets on the way. The film is fun pointless action and should be watched at least twice before you get complete appreciation for it. Me: 4/5 Audience: 3.5/5

    Can you imagine seeing a Star Trek movie where Captain Kirk becomes a traitor? Or how about The cookie monster a child abuser, or Luke Skywalker becoming evil? What about Mr. Rogers on the 10 most wanted? That's the kind of nonsense this movie peddles. It is total garbage. And is not a mission impossible story at all. Sure the movie is fine but give it a different name and don't steal any themes from the true mission impossible story. If you are not a mission impossible fan you will find this movie exciting.....but not if you are a true Mission Impossible fan. This is worst then terrible, and obviously not written by someone who understood the series. Rather promoted using the IMF name, music, themes, but not the heart and soul of this great series. I can't imagine the outrage if they did this to Star Trek or had a sequel to the Walton's and now John Boy turns into a death row criminal. The fact someone tried this with our beloved series just goes to show that double espionage can be tried, but we know better and know this is not really mission impossible but an impostor!

    I cant believe they wasted one of the best TV shows EVER simply to make a vehicle for an increasingly geriatric Tom Cruise. and I cant believe that constant bulgy teary eyes, top-gun gape and all caps sentences every annoying moment of the movie is what defines good acting in Hollywood these days... sigh..... And what is there to "think" about in this movie?? Tom Cruise in starting frame. Tom Cruise gets double teamed. Tom Cruise gets mad. Tom Cruise gets teary eyed. Tom Cruise exclaims constantly (DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED!!!!!!!!!). Tom Cruise kills bad guy with a helicopter and a train. Tom Cruise saves the day. Tom Cruise in last frame. Has any Tom Cruise movie been any different?? I wish that helicopter blade had made those two extra inches...sigh.. would have made my day..

    (This review is heavy on spoilersbut it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet) Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission: Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on. And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused  I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses. Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins. The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before. Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT  or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously. And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it  the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off  just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc. Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette  the old 3&frac12; inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie. I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan "Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!" Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good  for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place. Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat  REALLY?  that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart. Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it. The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally. This actually very slow "action" movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience. "I've been disavowed," says Ethan. Don't worry: it won't be your last time.
