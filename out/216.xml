    Written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner, this has become the flag bearer of all rom-coms. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) first meet when she gives him a ride to New York after they both graduate from the University of Chicago. They have a spirited and cantankerous debate. They would keep bumping into each other over the years until finally they have to decide whether they can just be friends, or if they can be more. This movie ask the big question. Can a man and a woman just be friends? It has some of the most iconic scenes of all times, and none is bigger than the fake orgasm scene. Billy Crystal is quick and smart. It shows on screen and gives reason to why Sally would fall for Harry. At the time, Meg Ryan is about to start her rein as the rom-com queen. She is at maximum cuteness, and quick enough to play with Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner.

    I'm not sure why I never caught this move before...after all. it's been out there for 24 years. But, I'm glad I did. It's not a GREAT movie, but it's a very good movie. I know. Some of you are upset that I don't think it's great. I'm not totally into what I'll refer to as "episodic movies". I like a movie that flows. And this one really didn't. Various episodes were punctuated by old couples briefly telling how they met. I enjoyed those little vignettes between episodes...but I just don't like episodicness (and yes, I know that's not a word). Now, aside from that, it's a good movie. Boy meets girl. Boy and girl grate on each other. Boy and girl keep running into each other every few years. Eventually boy and girl fall in love, but not until they've annoyed the hell out of each other every once in a while. And every once in a while along the way, there's a heckuva funny line. There are really only 4 actors worth mentioning here. To begin with, Billy Crystal as the male lead. I'd forgotten he was once young; like back when he was on "Soap". But what I found interesting about his performance was that in terms of phrasing, he's still sorta the same. Meg Ryan...well, I've come to like her as an actress, but I never really noticed her until 4 years later in "Sleepless In Seattle". Here...well, she's an actress...but not quite Meg Ryan, yet. Here, I was not overly impressed with her as the female lead. Carrie Fisher is her best friend, and does nicely. She's pleasant enough, but not good enough to have maintained her star status from "Star Wars". Bruno Kirby was pretty good as the best friend's husband and pal to Crystal. He had a period of playing this sort of role rather well. It's interesting to watch this Rob Reiner film in what would have been his formative years. So for me, this film doesn't set the world on fire, but it's pretty good.

    Wonderful romantic comedy (one of the best and most memorable from the 80s) focuses on two friends (Harry, a political consultant, Sally, a journalist) who find themselves struggling not to fall in love, attempting to date other people while secretly pining for each other, and soon no longer able to resist the urgings for more than just conversation over long walks and lunches discussing the love-making they could have together. Look, the conversations (with lots of clever and funny banter back and forth, mostly about sex and relationships, what men and women truly think and feel despite what they say and seem to convey) are a major asset between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, but the stars' chemistry (this really sets Ryan's career off) is impeccable. I love the quiet discomfort and inability to dismiss their first sexual encounter as a "mistake", and their New Years Eve confrontation, addressing how they truly feel for each other, was a nice way to close the film, the conclusion fitting and satisfying. With Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher perfectly cast as Crystal and Ryan's best buds, a "fake orgasm" in a deli (as Ryan (effectively) convinces Crystal that you can fool a man into believing he's successfully pleased his female partner, with the "I'll have what she's having" line an absolute classic), several early encounters between Ryan and Crystal that has them arguing about "what men and women really want" (Crystal often just aggravating Ryan, getting her emotionally all out of sorts because mostly what he says is true and she can't accept it), and those passing glances of aching and acknowledgment (I had forgotten just how good Crystal, in particular, was at that; Ryan has a character that tries hard to pass off as if nothing about break-ups and "mistaken sex" bothers her, but it all eventually spills out when she simply wants a real relationship, meaningful and of depth), as well as, excerpts from real older marrieds commenting on how they wound up together, helped make "When Harry Met Sally" such an enduring treasure. Include the New York setting as the obviously appropriate backdrop and the likability of the stars amidst it, and why wouldn't this film remain such a valued and cherished romantic comedy?

    With incredible writing from Nora Ephron and witty delivery by Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, many angles of the spawning of relationships are humorously recreated. There are also "real couples" seemingly 70 years or older who recant their coupling interview style, which creates a palette for our actors to work with.Circumstances surrounding the interwoven lives of our two star-crossed lovers are always ironic. It's beefed up by the iconic restaurant scene and held together by Meg's every woman fear that she'll turn 30 and still not be married. Billy loses his man card for letting out the age old men's secret that men & women can't be just friends?

    WHEN HARRY MET SALLY I was disappointed. This is supposed to be one of those classic films I guess I didn't get it. This was just a regular, average romantic comedy. I didn't hate it it just wasn't anything special. Everyone knows the famous scene in this movie when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in a caf&eacute;. Yeah it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny. The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who are 2 people who car share their journey after leaving college. They do not get along very well on the way. 5 years later, they bump into each other and they still don't like each other. Another 5 years passes and they bump into each other again and they both have something in common they have both recently been dumped. So they cry on each others shoulders and become friends and the rest is what you can expect from any romantic comedy. The one thing that was different about this film was the dialogue. A lot of the movie was just Harry & Sally talking. Not a lot else happened through the movie, it was just their opinions on certain things and them talking to each other but I liked this. The dialogue was very good in this film. It was not boring and you actually wanted to hear their conversation. It was very well written. The acting was really good too. Billy and Meg both did a great job and Carrie Fisher was in it and she did a good job too. One of the things I did like about this movie was the feel of it. I love 80s movies and you can really tell this is an 80s film. They have a completely different feel to them than the more recent movies and I love them. In my mind, the 80s films are the best. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It was OK but I guess I had to watch it at the time to understand why it is so classic.

    If you're going to like this, it will basically come down to a few things. Do you like Capra and old Hollywood? Which is to say, do you cherish movies where we can pretend that people are struggling in the real world, while knowing every step of the way they're falling in love in a movie? And that life ought to work a bit like this, love as unpredictable fate. Do you not mind Woody Allen? Enough to accept the roundly toned-down narrative tricks, neurosis, cynical wit as disillusioned truth and reference to other movies as blueprint for life, in our case (linking back to #1) Casablanca. (if you like Allen too much, this will grate as second-rate compromise) Can you still stomach Allen's movie image of the cute, jazzy New York? Do you watch endless reruns of Friends, just because of the cozy mood? Can you kid yourself for a while that Cosmo blurbs can substitute for relationship insights? None of it means you are a bad person. You just want from time to time some comfort food for the eyes. So if half of those are true, Rob Reiner has made for you this sticky-sweet film from Nora Ephron's smart recipe, much better than Ephron's own with Hanks and Ryan, Sleepless and You've Got Mail.

    Highlight : Went on to be a Trend Setter among Romantic Comedies "When Harry Met Sally..." is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud (I'll have what she's having), and other times when I was like "that's really sweet". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner ( Director of The Bucket List and A Few Good Men). It's a wonderful romantic comedy about a man and a woman who struggles to keep their relationship afloat after the threat of sex endangers it. Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women. The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. Highly Recommended!! My Rating - 9/10

    Near perfect romantic comedy about two friends who test the myth that men and women can never be "just friends". Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet when sharing a long hour car journey to New York after graduating college, spending the time bickering about relationships and life. They eventually agree that men and women can never be platonic friends as sex will always get in the way. They part company and their lives move on, but years later they encounter each other again and the same issue is raised. The real star of the film is Nora Ephron's sparkling script full of fantastic organic lines that flow through the characters and never feel forced. It's written and delivered so expertly it's at times indecipherable from ad-lib. Like all the best romantic comedies it's a film with real heart about believable characters, and the comedy is allowed to stem from that - unlike so many of its contemporaries where relationships seem to have been roughly sketched around a few big set pieces or an overarching concept where the guy is secretly two twins (or something). It begins at a steady pace allowing us to bond with Harry and Sally before asking us to sympathise with them. This deliberate controlled direction by Rob Reiner gives the film some weight as well as humour, not simply rushing the character development to get the gags. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are superb as the 'couple' delivering pitch perfect performances that don't overshadow the quality of the material and investing real warmth and likability into the characters. It's a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question "Can men and women be friends?" is around.

    The quintessential romantic comedy, When Harry Met Sally lives up to the twofold promise of its genre; it is as genuinely funny as it is romantic. Credit its writer, Nora Ephron, its director, Rob Reiner, and its four leadsBilly Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, and Bruno Kirbyfor the film's steady stream of well-earned laughs. The movie properly centers around well-read, well-bred, well-dressed, well-mannered urbanites who have good looks, good jobs, and good futures. The question of suitability need not consider intelligence, physical attractiveness, or the ability to provide. That leaves compatibility of character to determine who ends up with whom. This keeps the romantic conflict light, which opens a void for the comedyand possibly some truths about relationshipsto fill. Filling that void is where most romantic comedies fall shortleaving them shallow and hollow, and not very funnyand where When Harry Met Sally succeeds. Billy Crystal plays Harry Burns, who "meets" Sally Albright, played by Meg Ryan, multiple times throughout the film. Each time they meet, time has changed them, so it's as if they are meeting each other for the first time. The true first time they meet, Harry is a self-inflicted cynic who always flips to the last page of a book before he reads it so that he'll know how it ends in case he dies before finishing it. His eyes seem perpetually half-closed, and his tone reflects a young man who thinks he knows it all. He plants the seed that germinates into the main thematic question of the film by positing to Sally that men and women can never be friends because "the sex part always gets in the way." Sally is a wide-eyed, prim-and-proper optimist, who admits that she has a positive outlook on life, as if she knows there's something wrong with that. Each time they meet again, their eyes change disposition in opposite directionshis becoming more open as life throws him curveballs, and hers becoming less perky as experience wears down her naivety. Eventually, their eyes meet in the middle, and the third meeting, which takes place roughly ten years after the first, turns Harry and Sally into friends. About a year goes by, and we find the title characters dancing together at a New Year's Eve party. This scene clinches our suspicion that Crystal and Ryan aren't just fine comic performers; they're fine actors. They act this scene with their eyes. Throughout the film, both actors prove their ability to adapt to their characters' changing ages and attitudes. Ryan's performance is chameleonic, her character subtly adjusting to each costume change. This scene also demonstrates the film's exceptional use of music; as Harry and Sally realize what is developing between them, we realize that the song they are dancing to is Harry Connick Jr.'s rendition of "I Could Write A Book," which finds the appropriate lyrics, "how to make two lovers of friends." Still, the couple does not consummate. Time passes. They try to set each other up with their best friends through a double blind dateanother scene in which Crystal and Ryan tell the story with their eyes. And we recognize Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher as the perfect players of the "other couple." Finally, Harry and Sally have sex, and we learn the real reason why men and women can never remain "just friends." It's not because the man will always want to have sex with the woman; it's because, once they have sex, the woman will attach more meaning to the act than the man. This answer raises another question: when does, or why should, sex mean something, and when does, or why should, it mean everything? The film doesn't really answer this question, but at least it asks it. Instead, it ends in textbook romantic fashion, with Sally standing alone at midnight on another New Year's Eve, and Harry running through the streets to meet her once again, this time forever, as Frank Sinatra serenades them with "It Had To Be You," instrumental variations of which have accompanied moments throughout the movie. We may be tempted to view the final scene as the only unoriginal one, but I like to appreciate it as a dual realizationpart Harry's, and part oursthat he, and the movie he lives in, really do, after all, believe in true love.

    When Harry Met Sally is a romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner. It stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan together with Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. The story follows the title characters from the time they meet just before sharing a cross-country drive, through twelve years or so of chance encounters in New York City. The film opens with the two strangers,Harry and Sally.Both newly graduated from the University of Chicago, share a car trip from Chicago to New York, where they are both going to make their way. During the trip, they discuss aspects of their characters and their lives, eventually deciding it is impossible for men and women to be "just friends." They arrive in New York and go their separate ways. They meet a few years later on an airplane and Harry reveals he is married. They meet again at a bookstore a few years after that where Harry reveals he is now divorced. From that point on, the two form a friendship. Eventually their closeness results in their respective best friends meeting and falling in love with each other. At a New Year's Eve party Harry and Sally confront the complex tangle of emotions they feel for each other. This is a classic romantic comedy.It is a touching and funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies, and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.And what makes this a classic despite the story's predictability, is the dialogue and the chemistry, which makes for a high-wire act.Most of all,it presents question and provokes thought to both men and women.

    If you're going to like this, it will basically come down to a few things. Do you like Capra and old Hollywood? Which is to say, do you cherish movies where we can pretend that people are struggling in the real world, while knowing every step of the way they're falling in love in a movie? And that life ought to work a bit like this, love as unpredictable fate. Do you not mind Woody Allen? Enough to accept the roundly toned-down narrative tricks, neurosis, cynical wit as disillusioned truth and reference to other movies as blueprint for life, in our case (linking back to #1) Casablanca. (if you like Allen too much, this will grate as second-rate compromise) Can you still stomach Allen's movie image of the cute, jazzy New York? Do you watch endless reruns of Friends, just because of the cozy mood? Can you kid yourself for a while that Cosmo blurbs can substitute for relationship insights? None of it means you are a bad person. You just want from time to time some comfort food for the eyes. So if half of those are true, Rob Reiner has made for you this sticky-sweet film from Nora Ephron's smart recipe, much better than Ephron's own with Hanks and Ryan, Sleepless and You've Got Mail.

    Highlight : Went on to be a Trend Setter among Romantic Comedies "When Harry Met Sally..." is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud (I'll have what she's having), and other times when I was like "that's really sweet". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner ( Director of The Bucket List and A Few Good Men). It's a wonderful romantic comedy about a man and a woman who struggles to keep their relationship afloat after the threat of sex endangers it. Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women. The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. Highly Recommended!! My Rating - 9/10

    Near perfect romantic comedy about two friends who test the myth that men and women can never be "just friends". Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet when sharing a long hour car journey to New York after graduating college, spending the time bickering about relationships and life. They eventually agree that men and women can never be platonic friends as sex will always get in the way. They part company and their lives move on, but years later they encounter each other again and the same issue is raised. The real star of the film is Nora Ephron's sparkling script full of fantastic organic lines that flow through the characters and never feel forced. It's written and delivered so expertly it's at times indecipherable from ad-lib. Like all the best romantic comedies it's a film with real heart about believable characters, and the comedy is allowed to stem from that - unlike so many of its contemporaries where relationships seem to have been roughly sketched around a few big set pieces or an overarching concept where the guy is secretly two twins (or something). It begins at a steady pace allowing us to bond with Harry and Sally before asking us to sympathise with them. This deliberate controlled direction by Rob Reiner gives the film some weight as well as humour, not simply rushing the character development to get the gags. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are superb as the 'couple' delivering pitch perfect performances that don't overshadow the quality of the material and investing real warmth and likability into the characters. It's a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question "Can men and women be friends?" is around.

    The quintessential romantic comedy, When Harry Met Sally lives up to the twofold promise of its genre; it is as genuinely funny as it is romantic. Credit its writer, Nora Ephron, its director, Rob Reiner, and its four leadsBilly Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, and Bruno Kirbyfor the film's steady stream of well-earned laughs. The movie properly centers around well-read, well-bred, well-dressed, well-mannered urbanites who have good looks, good jobs, and good futures. The question of suitability need not consider intelligence, physical attractiveness, or the ability to provide. That leaves compatibility of character to determine who ends up with whom. This keeps the romantic conflict light, which opens a void for the comedyand possibly some truths about relationshipsto fill. Filling that void is where most romantic comedies fall shortleaving them shallow and hollow, and not very funnyand where When Harry Met Sally succeeds. Billy Crystal plays Harry Burns, who "meets" Sally Albright, played by Meg Ryan, multiple times throughout the film. Each time they meet, time has changed them, so it's as if they are meeting each other for the first time. The true first time they meet, Harry is a self-inflicted cynic who always flips to the last page of a book before he reads it so that he'll know how it ends in case he dies before finishing it. His eyes seem perpetually half-closed, and his tone reflects a young man who thinks he knows it all. He plants the seed that germinates into the main thematic question of the film by positing to Sally that men and women can never be friends because "the sex part always gets in the way." Sally is a wide-eyed, prim-and-proper optimist, who admits that she has a positive outlook on life, as if she knows there's something wrong with that. Each time they meet again, their eyes change disposition in opposite directionshis becoming more open as life throws him curveballs, and hers becoming less perky as experience wears down her naivety. Eventually, their eyes meet in the middle, and the third meeting, which takes place roughly ten years after the first, turns Harry and Sally into friends. About a year goes by, and we find the title characters dancing together at a New Year's Eve party. This scene clinches our suspicion that Crystal and Ryan aren't just fine comic performers; they're fine actors. They act this scene with their eyes. Throughout the film, both actors prove their ability to adapt to their characters' changing ages and attitudes. Ryan's performance is chameleonic, her character subtly adjusting to each costume change. This scene also demonstrates the film's exceptional use of music; as Harry and Sally realize what is developing between them, we realize that the song they are dancing to is Harry Connick Jr.'s rendition of "I Could Write A Book," which finds the appropriate lyrics, "how to make two lovers of friends." Still, the couple does not consummate. Time passes. They try to set each other up with their best friends through a double blind dateanother scene in which Crystal and Ryan tell the story with their eyes. And we recognize Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher as the perfect players of the "other couple." Finally, Harry and Sally have sex, and we learn the real reason why men and women can never remain "just friends." It's not because the man will always want to have sex with the woman; it's because, once they have sex, the woman will attach more meaning to the act than the man. This answer raises another question: when does, or why should, sex mean something, and when does, or why should, it mean everything? The film doesn't really answer this question, but at least it asks it. Instead, it ends in textbook romantic fashion, with Sally standing alone at midnight on another New Year's Eve, and Harry running through the streets to meet her once again, this time forever, as Frank Sinatra serenades them with "It Had To Be You," instrumental variations of which have accompanied moments throughout the movie. We may be tempted to view the final scene as the only unoriginal one, but I like to appreciate it as a dual realizationpart Harry's, and part oursthat he, and the movie he lives in, really do, after all, believe in true love.

    When Harry Met Sally is a romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner. It stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan together with Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. The story follows the title characters from the time they meet just before sharing a cross-country drive, through twelve years or so of chance encounters in New York City. The film opens with the two strangers,Harry and Sally.Both newly graduated from the University of Chicago, share a car trip from Chicago to New York, where they are both going to make their way. During the trip, they discuss aspects of their characters and their lives, eventually deciding it is impossible for men and women to be "just friends." They arrive in New York and go their separate ways. They meet a few years later on an airplane and Harry reveals he is married. They meet again at a bookstore a few years after that where Harry reveals he is now divorced. From that point on, the two form a friendship. Eventually their closeness results in their respective best friends meeting and falling in love with each other. At a New Year's Eve party Harry and Sally confront the complex tangle of emotions they feel for each other. This is a classic romantic comedy.It is a touching and funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies, and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.And what makes this a classic despite the story's predictability, is the dialogue and the chemistry, which makes for a high-wire act.Most of all,it presents question and provokes thought to both men and women.

    Written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner, this has become the flag bearer of all rom-coms. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) first meet when she gives him a ride to New York after they both graduate from the University of Chicago. They have a spirited and cantankerous debate. They would keep bumping into each other over the years until finally they have to decide whether they can just be friends, or if they can be more. This movie ask the big question. Can a man and a woman just be friends? It has some of the most iconic scenes of all times, and none is bigger than the fake orgasm scene. Billy Crystal is quick and smart. It shows on screen and gives reason to why Sally would fall for Harry. At the time, Meg Ryan is about to start her rein as the rom-com queen. She is at maximum cuteness, and quick enough to play with Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner.

    I'm not sure why I never caught this move before...after all. it's been out there for 24 years. But, I'm glad I did. It's not a GREAT movie, but it's a very good movie. I know. Some of you are upset that I don't think it's great. I'm not totally into what I'll refer to as "episodic movies". I like a movie that flows. And this one really didn't. Various episodes were punctuated by old couples briefly telling how they met. I enjoyed those little vignettes between episodes...but I just don't like episodicness (and yes, I know that's not a word). Now, aside from that, it's a good movie. Boy meets girl. Boy and girl grate on each other. Boy and girl keep running into each other every few years. Eventually boy and girl fall in love, but not until they've annoyed the hell out of each other every once in a while. And every once in a while along the way, there's a heckuva funny line. There are really only 4 actors worth mentioning here. To begin with, Billy Crystal as the male lead. I'd forgotten he was once young; like back when he was on "Soap". But what I found interesting about his performance was that in terms of phrasing, he's still sorta the same. Meg Ryan...well, I've come to like her as an actress, but I never really noticed her until 4 years later in "Sleepless In Seattle". Here...well, she's an actress...but not quite Meg Ryan, yet. Here, I was not overly impressed with her as the female lead. Carrie Fisher is her best friend, and does nicely. She's pleasant enough, but not good enough to have maintained her star status from "Star Wars". Bruno Kirby was pretty good as the best friend's husband and pal to Crystal. He had a period of playing this sort of role rather well. It's interesting to watch this Rob Reiner film in what would have been his formative years. So for me, this film doesn't set the world on fire, but it's pretty good.

    Wonderful romantic comedy (one of the best and most memorable from the 80s) focuses on two friends (Harry, a political consultant, Sally, a journalist) who find themselves struggling not to fall in love, attempting to date other people while secretly pining for each other, and soon no longer able to resist the urgings for more than just conversation over long walks and lunches discussing the love-making they could have together. Look, the conversations (with lots of clever and funny banter back and forth, mostly about sex and relationships, what men and women truly think and feel despite what they say and seem to convey) are a major asset between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, but the stars' chemistry (this really sets Ryan's career off) is impeccable. I love the quiet discomfort and inability to dismiss their first sexual encounter as a "mistake", and their New Years Eve confrontation, addressing how they truly feel for each other, was a nice way to close the film, the conclusion fitting and satisfying. With Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher perfectly cast as Crystal and Ryan's best buds, a "fake orgasm" in a deli (as Ryan (effectively) convinces Crystal that you can fool a man into believing he's successfully pleased his female partner, with the "I'll have what she's having" line an absolute classic), several early encounters between Ryan and Crystal that has them arguing about "what men and women really want" (Crystal often just aggravating Ryan, getting her emotionally all out of sorts because mostly what he says is true and she can't accept it), and those passing glances of aching and acknowledgment (I had forgotten just how good Crystal, in particular, was at that; Ryan has a character that tries hard to pass off as if nothing about break-ups and "mistaken sex" bothers her, but it all eventually spills out when she simply wants a real relationship, meaningful and of depth), as well as, excerpts from real older marrieds commenting on how they wound up together, helped make "When Harry Met Sally" such an enduring treasure. Include the New York setting as the obviously appropriate backdrop and the likability of the stars amidst it, and why wouldn't this film remain such a valued and cherished romantic comedy?

    With incredible writing from Nora Ephron and witty delivery by Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, many angles of the spawning of relationships are humorously recreated. There are also "real couples" seemingly 70 years or older who recant their coupling interview style, which creates a palette for our actors to work with.Circumstances surrounding the interwoven lives of our two star-crossed lovers are always ironic. It's beefed up by the iconic restaurant scene and held together by Meg's every woman fear that she'll turn 30 and still not be married. Billy loses his man card for letting out the age old men's secret that men & women can't be just friends?

    WHEN HARRY MET SALLY I was disappointed. This is supposed to be one of those classic films I guess I didn't get it. This was just a regular, average romantic comedy. I didn't hate it it just wasn't anything special. Everyone knows the famous scene in this movie when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in a caf&eacute;. Yeah it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny. The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who are 2 people who car share their journey after leaving college. They do not get along very well on the way. 5 years later, they bump into each other and they still don't like each other. Another 5 years passes and they bump into each other again and they both have something in common they have both recently been dumped. So they cry on each others shoulders and become friends and the rest is what you can expect from any romantic comedy. The one thing that was different about this film was the dialogue. A lot of the movie was just Harry & Sally talking. Not a lot else happened through the movie, it was just their opinions on certain things and them talking to each other but I liked this. The dialogue was very good in this film. It was not boring and you actually wanted to hear their conversation. It was very well written. The acting was really good too. Billy and Meg both did a great job and Carrie Fisher was in it and she did a good job too. One of the things I did like about this movie was the feel of it. I love 80s movies and you can really tell this is an 80s film. They have a completely different feel to them than the more recent movies and I love them. In my mind, the 80s films are the best. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It was OK but I guess I had to watch it at the time to understand why it is so classic.

They would keep bumping into each other over the years until finally they have to decide whether they can just be friends, or if they can be more. This movie ask the big question. Can a man and a woman just be friends? It has some of the most iconic scenes of all times, and none is bigger than the fake orgasm scene. Billy Crystal is quick and smart. It shows on screen and gives reason to why Sally would fall for Harry. At the time, Meg Ryan is about to start her rein as the rom-com queen. She is at maximum cuteness, and quick enough to play with Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner.

    I'm not sure why I never caught this move before...after all. it's been out there for 24 years. But, I'm glad I did. It's not a GREAT movie, but it's a very good movie. I know. Some of you are upset that I don't think it's great. I'm not totally into what I'll refer to as "episodic movies". I like a movie that flows. And this one really didn't. Various episodes were punctuated by old couples briefly telling how they met. I enjoyed those little vignettes between episodes...but I just don't like episodicness (and yes, I know that's not a word). Now, aside from that, it's a good movie. Boy meets girl. Boy and girl grate on each other. Boy and girl keep running into each other every few years. Eventually boy and girl fall in love, but not until they've annoyed the hell out of each other every once in a while. And every once in a while along the way, there's a heckuva funny line. There are really only 4 actors worth mentioning here. To begin with, Billy Crystal as the male lead. I'd forgotten he was once young; like back when he was on "Soap". But what I found interesting about his performance was that in terms of phrasing, he's still sorta the same. Meg Ryan...well, I've come to like her as an actress, but I never really noticed her until 4 years later in "Sleepless In Seattle". Here...well, she's an actress...but not quite Meg Ryan, yet. Here, I was not overly impressed with her as the female lead. Carrie Fisher is her best friend, and does nicely. She's pleasant enough, but not good enough to have maintained her star status from "Star Wars". Bruno Kirby was pretty good as the best friend's husband and pal to Crystal. He had a period of playing this sort of role rather well. It's interesting to watch this Rob Reiner film in what would have been his formative years. So for me, this film doesn't set the world on fire, but it's pretty good.

    Wonderful romantic comedy (one of the best and most memorable from the 80s) focuses on two friends (Harry, a political consultant, Sally, a journalist) who find themselves struggling not to fall in love, attempting to date other people while secretly pining for each other, and soon no longer able to resist the urgings for more than just conversation over long walks and lunches discussing the love-making they could have together. Look, the conversations (with lots of clever and funny banter back and forth, mostly about sex and relationships, what men and women truly think and feel despite what they say and seem to convey) are a major asset between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, but the stars' chemistry (this really sets Ryan's career off) is impeccable. I love the quiet discomfort and inability to dismiss their first sexual encounter as a "mistake", and their New Years Eve confrontation, addressing how they truly feel for each other, was a nice way to close the film, the conclusion fitting and satisfying. With Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher perfectly cast as Crystal and Ryan's best buds, a "fake orgasm" in a deli (as Ryan (effectively) convinces Crystal that you can fool a man into believing he's successfully pleased his female partner, with the "I'll have what she's having" line an absolute classic), several early encounters between Ryan and Crystal that has them arguing about "what men and women really want" (Crystal often just aggravating Ryan, getting her emotionally all out of sorts because mostly what he says is true and she can't accept it), and those passing glances of aching and acknowledgment (I had forgotten just how good Crystal, in particular, was at that; Ryan has a character that tries hard to pass off as if nothing about break-ups and "mistaken sex" bothers her, but it all eventually spills out when she simply wants a real relationship, meaningful and of depth), as well as, excerpts from real older marrieds commenting on how they wound up together, helped make "When Harry Met Sally" such an enduring treasure. Include the New York setting as the obviously appropriate backdrop and the likability of the stars amidst it, and why wouldn't this film remain such a valued and cherished romantic comedy?

    With incredible writing from Nora Ephron and witty delivery by Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, many angles of the spawning of relationships are humorously recreated. There are also "real couples" seemingly 70 years or older who recant their coupling interview style, which creates a palette for our actors to work with.Circumstances surrounding the interwoven lives of our two star-crossed lovers are always ironic. It's beefed up by the iconic restaurant scene and held together by Meg's every woman fear that she'll turn 30 and still not be married. Billy loses his man card for letting out the age old men's secret that men & women can't be just friends?

    WHEN HARRY MET SALLY I was disappointed. This is supposed to be one of those classic films I guess I didn't get it. This was just a regular, average romantic comedy. I didn't hate it it just wasn't anything special. Everyone knows the famous scene in this movie when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in a caf&eacute;. Yeah it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny. The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who are 2 people who car share their journey after leaving college. They do not get along very well on the way. 5 years later, they bump into each other and they still don't like each other. Another 5 years passes and they bump into each other again and they both have something in common they have both recently been dumped. So they cry on each others shoulders and become friends and the rest is what you can expect from any romantic comedy. The one thing that was different about this film was the dialogue. A lot of the movie was just Harry & Sally talking. Not a lot else happened through the movie, it was just their opinions on certain things and them talking to each other but I liked this. The dialogue was very good in this film. It was not boring and you actually wanted to hear their conversation. It was very well written. The acting was really good too. Billy and Meg both did a great job and Carrie Fisher was in it and she did a good job too. One of the things I did like about this movie was the feel of it. I love 80s movies and you can really tell this is an 80s film. They have a completely different feel to them than the more recent movies and I love them. In my mind, the 80s films are the best. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It was OK but I guess I had to watch it at the time to understand why it is so classic.

    If you're going to like this, it will basically come down to a few things. Do you like Capra and old Hollywood? Which is to say, do you cherish movies where we can pretend that people are struggling in the real world, while knowing every step of the way they're falling in love in a movie? And that life ought to work a bit like this, love as unpredictable fate. Do you not mind Woody Allen? Enough to accept the roundly toned-down narrative tricks, neurosis, cynical wit as disillusioned truth and reference to other movies as blueprint for life, in our case (linking back to #1) Casablanca. (if you like Allen too much, this will grate as second-rate compromise) Can you still stomach Allen's movie image of the cute, jazzy New York? Do you watch endless reruns of Friends, just because of the cozy mood? Can you kid yourself for a while that Cosmo blurbs can substitute for relationship insights? None of it means you are a bad person. You just want from time to time some comfort food for the eyes. So if half of those are true, Rob Reiner has made for you this sticky-sweet film from Nora Ephron's smart recipe, much better than Ephron's own with Hanks and Ryan, Sleepless and You've Got Mail.

    Highlight : Went on to be a Trend Setter among Romantic Comedies "When Harry Met Sally..." is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud (I'll have what she's having), and other times when I was like "that's really sweet". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner ( Director of The Bucket List and A Few Good Men). It's a wonderful romantic comedy about a man and a woman who struggles to keep their relationship afloat after the threat of sex endangers it. Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women. The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. Highly Recommended!! My Rating - 9/10

    Near perfect romantic comedy about two friends who test the myth that men and women can never be "just friends". Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet when sharing a long hour car journey to New York after graduating college, spending the time bickering about relationships and life. They eventually agree that men and women can never be platonic friends as sex will always get in the way. They part company and their lives move on, but years later they encounter each other again and the same issue is raised. The real star of the film is Nora Ephron's sparkling script full of fantastic organic lines that flow through the characters and never feel forced. It's written and delivered so expertly it's at times indecipherable from ad-lib. Like all the best romantic comedies it's a film with real heart about believable characters, and the comedy is allowed to stem from that - unlike so many of its contemporaries where relationships seem to have been roughly sketched around a few big set pieces or an overarching concept where the guy is secretly two twins (or something). It begins at a steady pace allowing us to bond with Harry and Sally before asking us to sympathise with them. This deliberate controlled direction by Rob Reiner gives the film some weight as well as humour, not simply rushing the character development to get the gags. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are superb as the 'couple' delivering pitch perfect performances that don't overshadow the quality of the material and investing real warmth and likability into the characters. It's a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question "Can men and women be friends?" is around.

    The quintessential romantic comedy, When Harry Met Sally lives up to the twofold promise of its genre; it is as genuinely funny as it is romantic. Credit its writer, Nora Ephron, its director, Rob Reiner, and its four leadsBilly Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, and Bruno Kirbyfor the film's steady stream of well-earned laughs. The movie properly centers around well-read, well-bred, well-dressed, well-mannered urbanites who have good looks, good jobs, and good futures. The question of suitability need not consider intelligence, physical attractiveness, or the ability to provide. That leaves compatibility of character to determine who ends up with whom. This keeps the romantic conflict light, which opens a void for the comedyand possibly some truths about relationshipsto fill. Filling that void is where most romantic comedies fall shortleaving them shallow and hollow, and not very funnyand where When Harry Met Sally succeeds. Billy Crystal plays Harry Burns, who "meets" Sally Albright, played by Meg Ryan, multiple times throughout the film. Each time they meet, time has changed them, so it's as if they are meeting each other for the first time. The true first time they meet, Harry is a self-inflicted cynic who always flips to the last page of a book before he reads it so that he'll know how it ends in case he dies before finishing it. His eyes seem perpetually half-closed, and his tone reflects a young man who thinks he knows it all. He plants the seed that germinates into the main thematic question of the film by positing to Sally that men and women can never be friends because "the sex part always gets in the way." Sally is a wide-eyed, prim-and-proper optimist, who admits that she has a positive outlook on life, as if she knows there's something wrong with that. Each time they meet again, their eyes change disposition in opposite directionshis becoming more open as life throws him curveballs, and hers becoming less perky as experience wears down her naivety. Eventually, their eyes meet in the middle, and the third meeting, which takes place roughly ten years after the first, turns Harry and Sally into friends. About a year goes by, and we find the title characters dancing together at a New Year's Eve party. This scene clinches our suspicion that Crystal and Ryan aren't just fine comic performers; they're fine actors. They act this scene with their eyes. Throughout the film, both actors prove their ability to adapt to their characters' changing ages and attitudes. Ryan's performance is chameleonic, her character subtly adjusting to each costume change. This scene also demonstrates the film's exceptional use of music; as Harry and Sally realize what is developing between them, we realize that the song they are dancing to is Harry Connick Jr.'s rendition of "I Could Write A Book," which finds the appropriate lyrics, "how to make two lovers of friends." Still, the couple does not consummate. Time passes. They try to set each other up with their best friends through a double blind dateanother scene in which Crystal and Ryan tell the story with their eyes. And we recognize Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher as the perfect players of the "other couple." Finally, Harry and Sally have sex, and we learn the real reason why men and women can never remain "just friends." It's not because the man will always want to have sex with the woman; it's because, once they have sex, the woman will attach more meaning to the act than the man. This answer raises another question: when does, or why should, sex mean something, and when does, or why should, it mean everything? The film doesn't really answer this question, but at least it asks it. Instead, it ends in textbook romantic fashion, with Sally standing alone at midnight on another New Year's Eve, and Harry running through the streets to meet her once again, this time forever, as Frank Sinatra serenades them with "It Had To Be You," instrumental variations of which have accompanied moments throughout the movie. We may be tempted to view the final scene as the only unoriginal one, but I like to appreciate it as a dual realizationpart Harry's, and part oursthat he, and the movie he lives in, really do, after all, believe in true love.

    When Harry Met Sally is a romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner. It stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan together with Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. The story follows the title characters from the time they meet just before sharing a cross-country drive, through twelve years or so of chance encounters in New York City. The film opens with the two strangers,Harry and Sally.Both newly graduated from the University of Chicago, share a car trip from Chicago to New York, where they are both going to make their way. During the trip, they discuss aspects of their characters and their lives, eventually deciding it is impossible for men and women to be "just friends." They arrive in New York and go their separate ways. They meet a few years later on an airplane and Harry reveals he is married. They meet again at a bookstore a few years after that where Harry reveals he is now divorced. From that point on, the two form a friendship. Eventually their closeness results in their respective best friends meeting and falling in love with each other. At a New Year's Eve party Harry and Sally confront the complex tangle of emotions they feel for each other. This is a classic romantic comedy.It is a touching and funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies, and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.And what makes this a classic despite the story's predictability, is the dialogue and the chemistry, which makes for a high-wire act.Most of all,it presents question and provokes thought to both men and women.

Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women. The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. Highly Recommended!! My Rating - 9/10

    Near perfect romantic comedy about two friends who test the myth that men and women can never be "just friends". Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet when sharing a long hour car journey to New York after graduating college, spending the time bickering about relationships and life. They eventually agree that men and women can never be platonic friends as sex will always get in the way. They part company and their lives move on, but years later they encounter each other again and the same issue is raised. The real star of the film is Nora Ephron's sparkling script full of fantastic organic lines that flow through the characters and never feel forced. It's written and delivered so expertly it's at times indecipherable from ad-lib. Like all the best romantic comedies it's a film with real heart about believable characters, and the comedy is allowed to stem from that - unlike so many of its contemporaries where relationships seem to have been roughly sketched around a few big set pieces or an overarching concept where the guy is secretly two twins (or something). It begins at a steady pace allowing us to bond with Harry and Sally before asking us to sympathise with them. This deliberate controlled direction by Rob Reiner gives the film some weight as well as humour, not simply rushing the character development to get the gags. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are superb as the 'couple' delivering pitch perfect performances that don't overshadow the quality of the material and investing real warmth and likability into the characters. It's a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question "Can men and women be friends?" is around.

    The quintessential romantic comedy, When Harry Met Sally lives up to the twofold promise of its genre; it is as genuinely funny as it is romantic. Credit its writer, Nora Ephron, its director, Rob Reiner, and its four leadsBilly Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, and Bruno Kirbyfor the film's steady stream of well-earned laughs. The movie properly centers around well-read, well-bred, well-dressed, well-mannered urbanites who have good looks, good jobs, and good futures. The question of suitability need not consider intelligence, physical attractiveness, or the ability to provide. That leaves compatibility of character to determine who ends up with whom. This keeps the romantic conflict light, which opens a void for the comedyand possibly some truths about relationshipsto fill. Filling that void is where most romantic comedies fall shortleaving them shallow and hollow, and not very funnyand where When Harry Met Sally succeeds. Billy Crystal plays Harry Burns, who "meets" Sally Albright, played by Meg Ryan, multiple times throughout the film. Each time they meet, time has changed them, so it's as if they are meeting each other for the first time. The true first time they meet, Harry is a self-inflicted cynic who always flips to the last page of a book before he reads it so that he'll know how it ends in case he dies before finishing it. His eyes seem perpetually half-closed, and his tone reflects a young man who thinks he knows it all. He plants the seed that germinates into the main thematic question of the film by positing to Sally that men and women can never be friends because "the sex part always gets in the way." Sally is a wide-eyed, prim-and-proper optimist, who admits that she has a positive outlook on life, as if she knows there's something wrong with that. Each time they meet again, their eyes change disposition in opposite directionshis becoming more open as life throws him curveballs, and hers becoming less perky as experience wears down her naivety. Eventually, their eyes meet in the middle, and the third meeting, which takes place roughly ten years after the first, turns Harry and Sally into friends. About a year goes by, and we find the title characters dancing together at a New Year's Eve party. This scene clinches our suspicion that Crystal and Ryan aren't just fine comic performers; they're fine actors. They act this scene with their eyes. Throughout the film, both actors prove their ability to adapt to their characters' changing ages and attitudes. Ryan's performance is chameleonic, her character subtly adjusting to each costume change. This scene also demonstrates the film's exceptional use of music; as Harry and Sally realize what is developing between them, we realize that the song they are dancing to is Harry Connick Jr.'s rendition of "I Could Write A Book," which finds the appropriate lyrics, "how to make two lovers of friends." Still, the couple does not consummate. Time passes. They try to set each other up with their best friends through a double blind dateanother scene in which Crystal and Ryan tell the story with their eyes. And we recognize Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher as the perfect players of the "other couple." Finally, Harry and Sally have sex, and we learn the real reason why men and women can never remain "just friends." It's not because the man will always want to have sex with the woman; it's because, once they have sex, the woman will attach more meaning to the act than the man. This answer raises another question: when does, or why should, sex mean something, and when does, or why should, it mean everything? The film doesn't really answer this question, but at least it asks it. Instead, it ends in textbook romantic fashion, with Sally standing alone at midnight on another New Year's Eve, and Harry running through the streets to meet her once again, this time forever, as Frank Sinatra serenades them with "It Had To Be You," instrumental variations of which have accompanied moments throughout the movie. We may be tempted to view the final scene as the only unoriginal one, but I like to appreciate it as a dual realizationpart Harry's, and part oursthat he, and the movie he lives in, really do, after all, believe in true love.

    When Harry Met Sally is a romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner. It stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan together with Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby.

    Written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner, this has become the flag bearer of all rom-coms. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) first meet when she gives him a ride to New York after they both graduate from the University of Chicago. They have a spirited and cantankerous debate. They would keep bumping into each other over the years until finally they have to decide whether they can just be friends, or if they can be more. This movie ask the big question. Can a man and a woman just be friends? It has some of the most iconic scenes of all times, and none is bigger than the fake orgasm scene. Billy Crystal is quick and smart. It shows on screen and gives reason to why Sally would fall for Harry. At the time, Meg Ryan is about to start her rein as the rom-com queen. She is at maximum cuteness, and quick enough to play with Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner.

    I'm not sure why I never caught this move before...after all. it's been out there for 24 years. But, I'm glad I did. It's not a GREAT movie, but it's a very good movie. I know. Some of you are upset that I don't think it's great. I'm not totally into what I'll refer to as "episodic movies". I like a movie that flows. And this one really didn't. Various episodes were punctuated by old couples briefly telling how they met. I enjoyed those little vignettes between episodes...but I just don't like episodicness (and yes, I know that's not a word). Now, aside from that, it's a good movie. Boy meets girl. Boy and girl grate on each other. Boy and girl keep running into each other every few years. Eventually boy and girl fall in love, but not until they've annoyed the hell out of each other every once in a while. And every once in a while along the way, there's a heckuva funny line. There are really only 4 actors worth mentioning here. To begin with, Billy Crystal as the male lead. I'd forgotten he was once young; like back when he was on "Soap". But what I found interesting about his performance was that in terms of phrasing, he's still sorta the same. Meg Ryan...well, I've come to like her as an actress, but I never really noticed her until 4 years later in "Sleepless In Seattle". Here...well, she's an actress...but not quite Meg Ryan, yet. Here, I was not overly impressed with her as the female lead. Carrie Fisher is her best friend, and does nicely. She's pleasant enough, but not good enough to have maintained her star status from "Star Wars". Bruno Kirby was pretty good as the best friend's husband and pal to Crystal. He had a period of playing this sort of role rather well. It's interesting to watch this Rob Reiner film in what would have been his formative years. So for me, this film doesn't set the world on fire, but it's pretty good.

    Wonderful romantic comedy (one of the best and most memorable from the 80s) focuses on two friends (Harry, a political consultant, Sally, a journalist) who find themselves struggling not to fall in love, attempting to date other people while secretly pining for each other, and soon no longer able to resist the urgings for more than just conversation over long walks and lunches discussing the love-making they could have together. Look, the conversations (with lots of clever and funny banter back and forth, mostly about sex and relationships, what men and women truly think and feel despite what they say and seem to convey) are a major asset between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, but the stars' chemistry (this really sets Ryan's career off) is impeccable. I love the quiet discomfort and inability to dismiss their first sexual encounter as a "mistake", and their New Years Eve confrontation, addressing how they truly feel for each other, was a nice way to close the film, the conclusion fitting and satisfying. With Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher perfectly cast as Crystal and Ryan's best buds, a "fake orgasm" in a deli (as Ryan (effectively) convinces Crystal that you can fool a man into believing he's successfully pleased his female partner, with the "I'll have what she's having" line an absolute classic), several early encounters between Ryan and Crystal that has them arguing about "what men and women really want" (Crystal often just aggravating Ryan, getting her emotionally all out of sorts because mostly what he says is true and she can't accept it), and those passing glances of aching and acknowledgment (I had forgotten just how good Crystal, in particular, was at that; Ryan has a character that tries hard to pass off as if nothing about break-ups and "mistaken sex" bothers her, but it all eventually spills out when she simply wants a real relationship, meaningful and of depth), as well as, excerpts from real older marrieds commenting on how they wound up together, helped make "When Harry Met Sally" such an enduring treasure. Include the New York setting as the obviously appropriate backdrop and the likability of the stars amidst it, and why wouldn't this film remain such a valued and cherished romantic comedy?

    With incredible writing from Nora Ephron and witty delivery by Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, many angles of the spawning of relationships are humorously recreated. There are also "real couples" seemingly 70 years or older who recant their coupling interview style, which creates a palette for our actors to work with.Circumstances surrounding the interwoven lives of our two star-crossed lovers are always ironic. It's beefed up by the iconic restaurant scene and held together by Meg's every woman fear that she'll turn 30 and still not be married. Billy loses his man card for letting out the age old men's secret that men & women can't be just friends?

    WHEN HARRY MET SALLY I was disappointed. This is supposed to be one of those classic films I guess I didn't get it. This was just a regular, average romantic comedy. I didn't hate it it just wasn't anything special. Everyone knows the famous scene in this movie when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in a caf&eacute;. Yeah it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny. The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who are 2 people who car share their journey after leaving college. They do not get along very well on the way. 5 years later, they bump into each other and they still don't like each other. Another 5 years passes and they bump into each other again and they both have something in common they have both recently been dumped. So they cry on each others shoulders and become friends and the rest is what you can expect from any romantic comedy. The one thing that was different about this film was the dialogue. A lot of the movie was just Harry & Sally talking. Not a lot else happened through the movie, it was just their opinions on certain things and them talking to each other but I liked this. The dialogue was very good in this film. It was not boring and you actually wanted to hear their conversation. It was very well written. The acting was really good too. Billy and Meg both did a great job and Carrie Fisher was in it and she did a good job too. One of the things I did like about this movie was the feel of it. I love 80s movies and you can really tell this is an 80s film. They have a completely different feel to them than the more recent movies and I love them. In my mind, the 80s films are the best. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It was OK but I guess I had to watch it at the time to understand why it is so classic.

    If you're going to like this, it will basically come down to a few things. Do you like Capra and old Hollywood? Which is to say, do you cherish movies where we can pretend that people are struggling in the real world, while knowing every step of the way they're falling in love in a movie? And that life ought to work a bit like this, love as unpredictable fate. Do you not mind Woody Allen? Enough to accept the roundly toned-down narrative tricks, neurosis, cynical wit as disillusioned truth and reference to other movies as blueprint for life, in our case (linking back to #1) Casablanca. (if you like Allen too much, this will grate as second-rate compromise) Can you still stomach Allen's movie image of the cute, jazzy New York? Do you watch endless reruns of Friends, just because of the cozy mood? Can you kid yourself for a while that Cosmo blurbs can substitute for relationship insights? None of it means you are a bad person. You just want from time to time some comfort food for the eyes. So if half of those are true, Rob Reiner has made for you this sticky-sweet film from Nora Ephron's smart recipe, much better than Ephron's own with Hanks and Ryan, Sleepless and You've Got Mail.

    Highlight : Went on to be a Trend Setter among Romantic Comedies "When Harry Met Sally..." is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud (I'll have what she's having), and other times when I was like "that's really sweet". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner ( Director of The Bucket List and A Few Good Men). It's a wonderful romantic comedy about a man and a woman who struggles to keep their relationship afloat after the threat of sex endangers it. Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women. The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding.

Meg Ryan...well, I've come to like her as an actress, but I never really noticed her until 4 years later in "Sleepless In Seattle". Here...well, she's an actress...but not quite Meg Ryan, yet. Here, I was not overly impressed with her as the female lead. Carrie Fisher is her best friend, and does nicely. She's pleasant enough, but not good enough to have maintained her star status from "Star Wars". Bruno Kirby was pretty good as the best friend's husband and pal to Crystal. He had a period of playing this sort of role rather well. It's interesting to watch this Rob Reiner film in what would have been his formative years. So for me, this film doesn't set the world on fire, but it's pretty good.

    Wonderful romantic comedy (one of the best and most memorable from the 80s) focuses on two friends (Harry, a political consultant, Sally, a journalist) who find themselves struggling not to fall in love, attempting to date other people while secretly pining for each other, and soon no longer able to resist the urgings for more than just conversation over long walks and lunches discussing the love-making they could have together. Look, the conversations (with lots of clever and funny banter back and forth, mostly about sex and relationships, what men and women truly think and feel despite what they say and seem to convey) are a major asset between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, but the stars' chemistry (this really sets Ryan's career off) is impeccable. I love the quiet discomfort and inability to dismiss their first sexual encounter as a "mistake", and their New Years Eve confrontation, addressing how they truly feel for each other, was a nice way to close the film, the conclusion fitting and satisfying. With Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher perfectly cast as Crystal and Ryan's best buds, a "fake orgasm" in a deli (as Ryan (effectively) convinces Crystal that you can fool a man into believing he's successfully pleased his female partner, with the "I'll have what she's having" line an absolute classic), several early encounters between Ryan and Crystal that has them arguing about "what men and women really want" (Crystal often just aggravating Ryan, getting her emotionally all out of sorts because mostly what he says is true and she can't accept it), and those passing glances of aching and acknowledgment (I had forgotten just how good Crystal, in particular, was at that; Ryan has a character that tries hard to pass off as if nothing about break-ups and "mistaken sex" bothers her, but it all eventually spills out when she simply wants a real relationship, meaningful and of depth), as well as, excerpts from real older marrieds commenting on how they wound up together, helped make "When Harry Met Sally" such an enduring treasure. Include the New York setting as the obviously appropriate backdrop and the likability of the stars amidst it, and why wouldn't this film remain such a valued and cherished romantic comedy?

    With incredible writing from Nora Ephron and witty delivery by Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, many angles of the spawning of relationships are humorously recreated. There are also "real couples" seemingly 70 years or older who recant their coupling interview style, which creates a palette for our actors to work with.Circumstances surrounding the interwoven lives of our two star-crossed lovers are always ironic. It's beefed up by the iconic restaurant scene and held together by Meg's every woman fear that she'll turn 30 and still not be married. Billy loses his man card for letting out the age old men's secret that men & women can't be just friends?

    WHEN HARRY MET SALLY I was disappointed. This is supposed to be one of those classic films I guess I didn't get it. This was just a regular, average romantic comedy. I didn't hate it it just wasn't anything special. Everyone knows the famous scene in this movie when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in a caf&eacute;. Yeah it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny. The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who are 2 people who car share their journey after leaving college. They do not get along very well on the way. 5 years later, they bump into each other and they still don't like each other. Another 5 years passes and they bump into each other again and they both have something in common they have both recently been dumped. So they cry on each others shoulders and become friends and the rest is what you can expect from any romantic comedy. The one thing that was different about this film was the dialogue. A lot of the movie was just Harry & Sally talking. Not a lot else happened through the movie, it was just their opinions on certain things and them talking to each other but I liked this. The dialogue was very good in this film. It was not boring and you actually wanted to hear their conversation. It was very well written. The acting was really good too. Billy and Meg both did a great job and Carrie Fisher was in it and she did a good job too. One of the things I did like about this movie was the feel of it. I love 80s movies and you can really tell this is an 80s film. They have a completely different feel to them than the more recent movies and I love them. In my mind, the 80s films are the best. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It was OK but I guess I had to watch it at the time to understand why it is so classic.

    If you're going to like this, it will basically come down to a few things. Do you like Capra and old Hollywood? Which is to say, do you cherish movies where we can pretend that people are struggling in the real world, while knowing every step of the way they're falling in love in a movie? And that life ought to work a bit like this, love as unpredictable fate. Do you not mind Woody Allen? Enough to accept the roundly toned-down narrative tricks, neurosis, cynical wit as disillusioned truth and reference to other movies as blueprint for life, in our case (linking back to #1) Casablanca. (if you like Allen too much, this will grate as second-rate compromise) Can you still stomach Allen's movie image of the cute, jazzy New York? Do you watch endless reruns of Friends, just because of the cozy mood? Can you kid yourself for a while that Cosmo blurbs can substitute for relationship insights? None of it means you are a bad person. You just want from time to time some comfort food for the eyes. So if half of those are true, Rob Reiner has made for you this sticky-sweet film from Nora Ephron's smart recipe, much better than Ephron's own with Hanks and Ryan, Sleepless and You've Got Mail.

    Highlight : Went on to be a Trend Setter among Romantic Comedies "When Harry Met Sally..." is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud (I'll have what she's having), and other times when I was like "that's really sweet". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner ( Director of The Bucket List and A Few Good Men). It's a wonderful romantic comedy about a man and a woman who struggles to keep their relationship afloat after the threat of sex endangers it. Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women. The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. Highly Recommended!! My Rating - 9/10

    Near perfect romantic comedy about two friends who test the myth that men and women can never be "just friends". Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet when sharing a long hour car journey to New York after graduating college, spending the time bickering about relationships and life. They eventually agree that men and women can never be platonic friends as sex will always get in the way. They part company and their lives move on, but years later they encounter each other again and the same issue is raised. The real star of the film is Nora Ephron's sparkling script full of fantastic organic lines that flow through the characters and never feel forced. It's written and delivered so expertly it's at times indecipherable from ad-lib. Like all the best romantic comedies it's a film with real heart about believable characters, and the comedy is allowed to stem from that - unlike so many of its contemporaries where relationships seem to have been roughly sketched around a few big set pieces or an overarching concept where the guy is secretly two twins (or something). It begins at a steady pace allowing us to bond with Harry and Sally before asking us to sympathise with them. This deliberate controlled direction by Rob Reiner gives the film some weight as well as humour, not simply rushing the character development to get the gags. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are superb as the 'couple' delivering pitch perfect performances that don't overshadow the quality of the material and investing real warmth and likability into the characters. It's a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question "Can men and women be friends?" is around.

    The quintessential romantic comedy, When Harry Met Sally lives up to the twofold promise of its genre; it is as genuinely funny as it is romantic. Credit its writer, Nora Ephron, its director, Rob Reiner, and its four leadsBilly Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, and Bruno Kirbyfor the film's steady stream of well-earned laughs. The movie properly centers around well-read, well-bred, well-dressed, well-mannered urbanites who have good looks, good jobs, and good futures. The question of suitability need not consider intelligence, physical attractiveness, or the ability to provide. That leaves compatibility of character to determine who ends up with whom. This keeps the romantic conflict light, which opens a void for the comedyand possibly some truths about relationshipsto fill. Filling that void is where most romantic comedies fall shortleaving them shallow and hollow, and not very funnyand where When Harry Met Sally succeeds. Billy Crystal plays Harry Burns, who "meets" Sally Albright, played by Meg Ryan, multiple times throughout the film. Each time they meet, time has changed them, so it's as if they are meeting each other for the first time. The true first time they meet, Harry is a self-inflicted cynic who always flips to the last page of a book before he reads it so that he'll know how it ends in case he dies before finishing it. His eyes seem perpetually half-closed, and his tone reflects a young man who thinks he knows it all. He plants the seed that germinates into the main thematic question of the film by positing to Sally that men and women can never be friends because "the sex part always gets in the way." Sally is a wide-eyed, prim-and-proper optimist, who admits that she has a positive outlook on life, as if she knows there's something wrong with that. Each time they meet again, their eyes change disposition in opposite directionshis becoming more open as life throws him curveballs, and hers becoming less perky as experience wears down her naivety. Eventually, their eyes meet in the middle, and the third meeting, which takes place roughly ten years after the first, turns Harry and Sally into friends. About a year goes by, and we find the title characters dancing together at a New Year's Eve party. This scene clinches our suspicion that Crystal and Ryan aren't just fine comic performers; they're fine actors. They act this scene with their eyes. Throughout the film, both actors prove their ability to adapt to their characters' changing ages and attitudes. Ryan's performance is chameleonic, her character subtly adjusting to each costume change. This scene also demonstrates the film's exceptional use of music; as Harry and Sally realize what is developing between them, we realize that the song they are dancing to is Harry Connick Jr.'s rendition of "I Could Write A Book," which finds the appropriate lyrics, "how to make two lovers of friends." Still, the couple does not consummate. Time passes. They try to set each other up with their best friends through a double blind dateanother scene in which Crystal and Ryan tell the story with their eyes. And we recognize Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher as the perfect players of the "other couple." Finally, Harry and Sally have sex, and we learn the real reason why men and women can never remain "just friends." It's not because the man will always want to have sex with the woman; it's because, once they have sex, the woman will attach more meaning to the act than the man. This answer raises another question: when does, or why should, sex mean something, and when does, or why should, it mean everything? The film doesn't really answer this question, but at least it asks it. Instead, it ends in textbook romantic fashion, with Sally standing alone at midnight on another New Year's Eve, and Harry running through the streets to meet her once again, this time forever, as Frank Sinatra serenades them with "It Had To Be You," instrumental variations of which have accompanied moments throughout the movie. We may be tempted to view the final scene as the only unoriginal one, but I like to appreciate it as a dual realizationpart Harry's, and part oursthat he, and the movie he lives in, really do, after all, believe in true love.

    When Harry Met Sally is a romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner. It stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan together with Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. The story follows the title characters from the time they meet just before sharing a cross-country drive, through twelve years or so of chance encounters in New York City. The film opens with the two strangers,Harry and Sally.Both newly graduated from the University of Chicago, share a car trip from Chicago to New York, where they are both going to make their way. During the trip, they discuss aspects of their characters and their lives, eventually deciding it is impossible for men and women to be "just friends." They arrive in New York and go their separate ways. They meet a few years later on an airplane and Harry reveals he is married. They meet again at a bookstore a few years after that where Harry reveals he is now divorced. From that point on, the two form a friendship. Eventually their closeness results in their respective best friends meeting and falling in love with each other. At a New Year's Eve party Harry and Sally confront the complex tangle of emotions they feel for each other. This is a classic romantic comedy.It is a touching and funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies, and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.And what makes this a classic despite the story's predictability, is the dialogue and the chemistry, which makes for a high-wire act.Most of all,it presents question and provokes thought to both men and women.

    Written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner, this has become the flag bearer of all rom-coms. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) first meet when she gives him a ride to New York after they both graduate from the University of Chicago. They have a spirited and cantankerous debate. They would keep bumping into each other over the years until finally they have to decide whether they can just be friends, or if they can be more. This movie ask the big question. Can a man and a woman just be friends? It has some of the most iconic scenes of all times, and none is bigger than the fake orgasm scene. Billy Crystal is quick and smart. It shows on screen and gives reason to why Sally would fall for Harry. At the time, Meg Ryan is about to start her rein as the rom-com queen. She is at maximum cuteness, and quick enough to play with Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner.

    I'm not sure why I never caught this move before...after all. it's been out there for 24 years. But, I'm glad I did. It's not a GREAT movie, but it's a very good movie. I know. Some of you are upset that I don't think it's great. I'm not totally into what I'll refer to as "episodic movies". I like a movie that flows. And this one really didn't. Various episodes were punctuated by old couples briefly telling how they met. I enjoyed those little vignettes between episodes...but I just don't like episodicness (and yes, I know that's not a word). Now, aside from that, it's a good movie. Boy meets girl. Boy and girl grate on each other. Boy and girl keep running into each other every few years. Eventually boy and girl fall in love, but not until they've annoyed the hell out of each other every once in a while. And every once in a while along the way, there's a heckuva funny line. There are really only 4 actors worth mentioning here. To begin with, Billy Crystal as the male lead. I'd forgotten he was once young; like back when he was on "Soap". But what I found interesting about his performance was that in terms of phrasing, he's still sorta the same.

He had a period of playing this sort of role rather well. It's interesting to watch this Rob Reiner film in what would have been his formative years. So for me, this film doesn't set the world on fire, but it's pretty good.

It's a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question "Can men and women be friends?" is around.

    The quintessential romantic comedy, When Harry Met Sally lives up to the twofold promise of its genre; it is as genuinely funny as it is romantic. Credit its writer, Nora Ephron, its director, Rob Reiner, and its four leadsBilly Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, and Bruno Kirbyfor the film's steady stream of well-earned laughs. The movie properly centers around well-read, well-bred, well-dressed, well-mannered urbanites who have good looks, good jobs, and good futures. The question of suitability need not consider intelligence, physical attractiveness, or the ability to provide. That leaves compatibility of character to determine who ends up with whom. This keeps the romantic conflict light, which opens a void for the comedyand possibly some truths about relationshipsto fill. Filling that void is where most romantic comedies fall shortleaving them shallow and hollow, and not very funnyand where When Harry Met Sally succeeds. Billy Crystal plays Harry Burns, who "meets" Sally Albright, played by Meg Ryan, multiple times throughout the film. Each time they meet, time has changed them, so it's as if they are meeting each other for the first time. The true first time they meet, Harry is a self-inflicted cynic who always flips to the last page of a book before he reads it so that he'll know how it ends in case he dies before finishing it. His eyes seem perpetually half-closed, and his tone reflects a young man who thinks he knows it all. He plants the seed that germinates into the main thematic question of the film by positing to Sally that men and women can never be friends because "the sex part always gets in the way." Sally is a wide-eyed, prim-and-proper optimist, who admits that she has a positive outlook on life, as if she knows there's something wrong with that. Each time they meet again, their eyes change disposition in opposite directionshis becoming more open as life throws him curveballs, and hers becoming less perky as experience wears down her naivety. Eventually, their eyes meet in the middle, and the third meeting, which takes place roughly ten years after the first, turns Harry and Sally into friends. About a year goes by, and we find the title characters dancing together at a New Year's Eve party. This scene clinches our suspicion that Crystal and Ryan aren't just fine comic performers; they're fine actors. They act this scene with their eyes. Throughout the film, both actors prove their ability to adapt to their characters' changing ages and attitudes. Ryan's performance is chameleonic, her character subtly adjusting to each costume change. This scene also demonstrates the film's exceptional use of music; as Harry and Sally realize what is developing between them, we realize that the song they are dancing to is Harry Connick Jr.'s rendition of "I Could Write A Book," which finds the appropriate lyrics, "how to make two lovers of friends." Still, the couple does not consummate. Time passes. They try to set each other up with their best friends through a double blind dateanother scene in which Crystal and Ryan tell the story with their eyes. And we recognize Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher as the perfect players of the "other couple." Finally, Harry and Sally have sex, and we learn the real reason why men and women can never remain "just friends." It's not because the man will always want to have sex with the woman; it's because, once they have sex, the woman will attach more meaning to the act than the man. This answer raises another question: when does, or why should, sex mean something, and when does, or why should, it mean everything? The film doesn't really answer this question, but at least it asks it. Instead, it ends in textbook romantic fashion, with Sally standing alone at midnight on another New Year's Eve, and Harry running through the streets to meet her once again, this time forever, as Frank Sinatra serenades them with "It Had To Be You," instrumental variations of which have accompanied moments throughout the movie. We may be tempted to view the final scene as the only unoriginal one, but I like to appreciate it as a dual realizationpart Harry's, and part oursthat he, and the movie he lives in, really do, after all, believe in true love.

    Written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner, this has become the flag bearer of all rom-coms. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) first meet when she gives him a ride to New York after they both graduate from the University of Chicago. They have a spirited and cantankerous debate. They would keep bumping into each other over the years until finally they have to decide whether they can just be friends, or if they can be more. This movie ask the big question. Can a man and a woman just be friends? It has some of the most iconic scenes of all times, and none is bigger than the fake orgasm scene. Billy Crystal is quick and smart. It shows on screen and gives reason to why Sally would fall for Harry. At the time, Meg Ryan is about to start her rein as the rom-com queen. She is at maximum cuteness, and quick enough to play with Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner.

    I'm not sure why I never caught this move before...after all. it's been out there for 24 years. But, I'm glad I did. It's not a GREAT movie, but it's a very good movie. I know. Some of you are upset that I don't think it's great. I'm not totally into what I'll refer to as "episodic movies". I like a movie that flows. And this one really didn't. Various episodes were punctuated by old couples briefly telling how they met. I enjoyed those little vignettes between episodes...but I just don't like episodicness (and yes, I know that's not a word). Now, aside from that, it's a good movie. Boy meets girl. Boy and girl grate on each other. Boy and girl keep running into each other every few years. Eventually boy and girl fall in love, but not until they've annoyed the hell out of each other every once in a while. And every once in a while along the way, there's a heckuva funny line. There are really only 4 actors worth mentioning here. To begin with, Billy Crystal as the male lead. I'd forgotten he was once young; like back when he was on "Soap". But what I found interesting about his performance was that in terms of phrasing, he's still sorta the same. Meg Ryan...well, I've come to like her as an actress, but I never really noticed her until 4 years later in "Sleepless In Seattle". Here...well, she's an actress...but not quite Meg Ryan, yet. Here, I was not overly impressed with her as the female lead. Carrie Fisher is her best friend, and does nicely. She's pleasant enough, but not good enough to have maintained her star status from "Star Wars". Bruno Kirby was pretty good as the best friend's husband and pal to Crystal. He had a period of playing this sort of role rather well. It's interesting to watch this Rob Reiner film in what would have been his formative years. So for me, this film doesn't set the world on fire, but it's pretty good.

    Wonderful romantic comedy (one of the best and most memorable from the 80s) focuses on two friends (Harry, a political consultant, Sally, a journalist) who find themselves struggling not to fall in love, attempting to date other people while secretly pining for each other, and soon no longer able to resist the urgings for more than just conversation over long walks and lunches discussing the love-making they could have together. Look, the conversations (with lots of clever and funny banter back and forth, mostly about sex and relationships, what men and women truly think and feel despite what they say and seem to convey) are a major asset between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, but the stars' chemistry (this really sets Ryan's career off) is impeccable. I love the quiet discomfort and inability to dismiss their first sexual encounter as a "mistake", and their New Years Eve confrontation, addressing how they truly feel for each other, was a nice way to close the film, the conclusion fitting and satisfying. With Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher perfectly cast as Crystal and Ryan's best buds, a "fake orgasm" in a deli (as Ryan (effectively) convinces Crystal that you can fool a man into believing he's successfully pleased his female partner, with the "I'll have what she's having" line an absolute classic), several early encounters between Ryan and Crystal that has them arguing about "what men and women really want" (Crystal often just aggravating Ryan, getting her emotionally all out of sorts because mostly what he says is true and she can't accept it), and those passing glances of aching and acknowledgment (I had forgotten just how good Crystal, in particular, was at that; Ryan has a character that tries hard to pass off as if nothing about break-ups and "mistaken sex" bothers her, but it all eventually spills out when she simply wants a real relationship, meaningful and of depth), as well as, excerpts from real older marrieds commenting on how they wound up together, helped make "When Harry Met Sally" such an enduring treasure. Include the New York setting as the obviously appropriate backdrop and the likability of the stars amidst it, and why wouldn't this film remain such a valued and cherished romantic comedy?

    With incredible writing from Nora Ephron and witty delivery by Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, many angles of the spawning of relationships are humorously recreated. There are also "real couples" seemingly 70 years or older who recant their coupling interview style, which creates a palette for our actors to work with.Circumstances surrounding the interwoven lives of our two star-crossed lovers are always ironic. It's beefed up by the iconic restaurant scene and held together by Meg's every woman fear that she'll turn 30 and still not be married. Billy loses his man card for letting out the age old men's secret that men & women can't be just friends?

    WHEN HARRY MET SALLY I was disappointed. This is supposed to be one of those classic films I guess I didn't get it. This was just a regular, average romantic comedy. I didn't hate it it just wasn't anything special. Everyone knows the famous scene in this movie when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in a caf&eacute;. Yeah it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny. The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who are 2 people who car share their journey after leaving college. They do not get along very well on the way. 5 years later, they bump into each other and they still don't like each other. Another 5 years passes and they bump into each other again and they both have something in common they have both recently been dumped. So they cry on each others shoulders and become friends and the rest is what you can expect from any romantic comedy. The one thing that was different about this film was the dialogue. A lot of the movie was just Harry & Sally talking. Not a lot else happened through the movie, it was just their opinions on certain things and them talking to each other but I liked this. The dialogue was very good in this film. It was not boring and you actually wanted to hear their conversation. It was very well written. The acting was really good too. Billy and Meg both did a great job and Carrie Fisher was in it and she did a good job too. One of the things I did like about this movie was the feel of it. I love 80s movies and you can really tell this is an 80s film. They have a completely different feel to them than the more recent movies and I love them. In my mind, the 80s films are the best. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It was OK but I guess I had to watch it at the time to understand why it is so classic.

    If you're going to like this, it will basically come down to a few things. Do you like Capra and old Hollywood? Which is to say, do you cherish movies where we can pretend that people are struggling in the real world, while knowing every step of the way they're falling in love in a movie? And that life ought to work a bit like this, love as unpredictable fate. Do you not mind Woody Allen? Enough to accept the roundly toned-down narrative tricks, neurosis, cynical wit as disillusioned truth and reference to other movies as blueprint for life, in our case (linking back to #1) Casablanca. (if you like Allen too much, this will grate as second-rate compromise) Can you still stomach Allen's movie image of the cute, jazzy New York? Do you watch endless reruns of Friends, just because of the cozy mood? Can you kid yourself for a while that Cosmo blurbs can substitute for relationship insights? None of it means you are a bad person. You just want from time to time some comfort food for the eyes. So if half of those are true, Rob Reiner has made for you this sticky-sweet film from Nora Ephron's smart recipe, much better than Ephron's own with Hanks and Ryan, Sleepless and You've Got Mail.

    Highlight : Went on to be a Trend Setter among Romantic Comedies "When Harry Met Sally..." is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud (I'll have what she's having), and other times when I was like "that's really sweet". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner ( Director of The Bucket List and A Few Good Men). It's a wonderful romantic comedy about a man and a woman who struggles to keep their relationship afloat after the threat of sex endangers it. Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women. The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. Highly Recommended!! My Rating - 9/10

    Near perfect romantic comedy about two friends who test the myth that men and women can never be "just friends". Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet when sharing a long hour car journey to New York after graduating college, spending the time bickering about relationships and life. They eventually agree that men and women can never be platonic friends as sex will always get in the way. They part company and their lives move on, but years later they encounter each other again and the same issue is raised. The real star of the film is Nora Ephron's sparkling script full of fantastic organic lines that flow through the characters and never feel forced. It's written and delivered so expertly it's at times indecipherable from ad-lib. Like all the best romantic comedies it's a film with real heart about believable characters, and the comedy is allowed to stem from that - unlike so many of its contemporaries where relationships seem to have been roughly sketched around a few big set pieces or an overarching concept where the guy is secretly two twins (or something). It begins at a steady pace allowing us to bond with Harry and Sally before asking us to sympathise with them. This deliberate controlled direction by Rob Reiner gives the film some weight as well as humour, not simply rushing the character development to get the gags. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are superb as the 'couple' delivering pitch perfect performances that don't overshadow the quality of the material and investing real warmth and likability into the characters. It's a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question "Can men and women be friends?" is around.

With Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher perfectly cast as Crystal and Ryan's best buds, a "fake orgasm" in a deli (as Ryan (effectively) convinces Crystal that you can fool a man into believing he's successfully pleased his female partner, with the "I'll have what she's having" line an absolute classic), several early encounters between Ryan and Crystal that has them arguing about "what men and women really want" (Crystal often just aggravating Ryan, getting her emotionally all out of sorts because mostly what he says is true and she can't accept it), and those passing glances of aching and acknowledgment (I had forgotten just how good Crystal, in particular, was at that; Ryan has a character that tries hard to pass off as if nothing about break-ups and "mistaken sex" bothers her, but it all eventually spills out when she simply wants a real relationship, meaningful and of depth), as well as, excerpts from real older marrieds commenting on how they wound up together, helped make "When Harry Met Sally" such an enduring treasure. Include the New York setting as the obviously appropriate backdrop and the likability of the stars amidst it, and why wouldn't this film remain such a valued and cherished romantic comedy?

    With incredible writing from Nora Ephron and witty delivery by Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, many angles of the spawning of relationships are humorously recreated. There are also "real couples" seemingly 70 years or older who recant their coupling interview style, which creates a palette for our actors to work with.Circumstances surrounding the interwoven lives of our two star-crossed lovers are always ironic. It's beefed up by the iconic restaurant scene and held together by Meg's every woman fear that she'll turn 30 and still not be married. Billy loses his man card for letting out the age old men's secret that men & women can't be just friends?

    WHEN HARRY MET SALLY I was disappointed. This is supposed to be one of those classic films I guess I didn't get it. This was just a regular, average romantic comedy. I didn't hate it it just wasn't anything special. Everyone knows the famous scene in this movie when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in a caf&eacute;. Yeah it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny. The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who are 2 people who car share their journey after leaving college. They do not get along very well on the way. 5 years later, they bump into each other and they still don't like each other. Another 5 years passes and they bump into each other again and they both have something in common they have both recently been dumped. So they cry on each others shoulders and become friends and the rest is what you can expect from any romantic comedy. The one thing that was different about this film was the dialogue. A lot of the movie was just Harry & Sally talking. Not a lot else happened through the movie, it was just their opinions on certain things and them talking to each other but I liked this. The dialogue was very good in this film. It was not boring and you actually wanted to hear their conversation. It was very well written. The acting was really good too. Billy and Meg both did a great job and Carrie Fisher was in it and she did a good job too. One of the things I did like about this movie was the feel of it. I love 80s movies and you can really tell this is an 80s film. They have a completely different feel to them than the more recent movies and I love them. In my mind, the 80s films are the best. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It was OK but I guess I had to watch it at the time to understand why it is so classic.

    If you're going to like this, it will basically come down to a few things. Do you like Capra and old Hollywood? Which is to say, do you cherish movies where we can pretend that people are struggling in the real world, while knowing every step of the way they're falling in love in a movie? And that life ought to work a bit like this, love as unpredictable fate. Do you not mind Woody Allen? Enough to accept the roundly toned-down narrative tricks, neurosis, cynical wit as disillusioned truth and reference to other movies as blueprint for life, in our case (linking back to #1) Casablanca. (if you like Allen too much, this will grate as second-rate compromise) Can you still stomach Allen's movie image of the cute, jazzy New York? Do you watch endless reruns of Friends, just because of the cozy mood? Can you kid yourself for a while that Cosmo blurbs can substitute for relationship insights? None of it means you are a bad person. You just want from time to time some comfort food for the eyes. So if half of those are true, Rob Reiner has made for you this sticky-sweet film from Nora Ephron's smart recipe, much better than Ephron's own with Hanks and Ryan, Sleepless and You've Got Mail.

    Highlight : Went on to be a Trend Setter among Romantic Comedies "When Harry Met Sally..." is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud (I'll have what she's having), and other times when I was like "that's really sweet". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner ( Director of The Bucket List and A Few Good Men). It's a wonderful romantic comedy about a man and a woman who struggles to keep their relationship afloat after the threat of sex endangers it. Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women. The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. Highly Recommended!! My Rating - 9/10

    Near perfect romantic comedy about two friends who test the myth that men and women can never be "just friends". Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet when sharing a long hour car journey to New York after graduating college, spending the time bickering about relationships and life. They eventually agree that men and women can never be platonic friends as sex will always get in the way. They part company and their lives move on, but years later they encounter each other again and the same issue is raised. The real star of the film is Nora Ephron's sparkling script full of fantastic organic lines that flow through the characters and never feel forced. It's written and delivered so expertly it's at times indecipherable from ad-lib. Like all the best romantic comedies it's a film with real heart about believable characters, and the comedy is allowed to stem from that - unlike so many of its contemporaries where relationships seem to have been roughly sketched around a few big set pieces or an overarching concept where the guy is secretly two twins (or something). It begins at a steady pace allowing us to bond with Harry and Sally before asking us to sympathise with them. This deliberate controlled direction by Rob Reiner gives the film some weight as well as humour, not simply rushing the character development to get the gags. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are superb as the 'couple' delivering pitch perfect performances that don't overshadow the quality of the material and investing real warmth and likability into the characters. It's a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question "Can men and women be friends?" is around.

    The quintessential romantic comedy, When Harry Met Sally lives up to the twofold promise of its genre; it is as genuinely funny as it is romantic. Credit its writer, Nora Ephron, its director, Rob Reiner, and its four leadsBilly Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, and Bruno Kirbyfor the film's steady stream of well-earned laughs. The movie properly centers around well-read, well-bred, well-dressed, well-mannered urbanites who have good looks, good jobs, and good futures. The question of suitability need not consider intelligence, physical attractiveness, or the ability to provide. That leaves compatibility of character to determine who ends up with whom. This keeps the romantic conflict light, which opens a void for the comedyand possibly some truths about relationshipsto fill. Filling that void is where most romantic comedies fall shortleaving them shallow and hollow, and not very funnyand where When Harry Met Sally succeeds. Billy Crystal plays Harry Burns, who "meets" Sally Albright, played by Meg Ryan, multiple times throughout the film. Each time they meet, time has changed them, so it's as if they are meeting each other for the first time. The true first time they meet, Harry is a self-inflicted cynic who always flips to the last page of a book before he reads it so that he'll know how it ends in case he dies before finishing it. His eyes seem perpetually half-closed, and his tone reflects a young man who thinks he knows it all. He plants the seed that germinates into the main thematic question of the film by positing to Sally that men and women can never be friends because "the sex part always gets in the way." Sally is a wide-eyed, prim-and-proper optimist, who admits that she has a positive outlook on life, as if she knows there's something wrong with that. Each time they meet again, their eyes change disposition in opposite directionshis becoming more open as life throws him curveballs, and hers becoming less perky as experience wears down her naivety. Eventually, their eyes meet in the middle, and the third meeting, which takes place roughly ten years after the first, turns Harry and Sally into friends. About a year goes by, and we find the title characters dancing together at a New Year's Eve party. This scene clinches our suspicion that Crystal and Ryan aren't just fine comic performers; they're fine actors. They act this scene with their eyes. Throughout the film, both actors prove their ability to adapt to their characters' changing ages and attitudes. Ryan's performance is chameleonic, her character subtly adjusting to each costume change. This scene also demonstrates the film's exceptional use of music; as Harry and Sally realize what is developing between them, we realize that the song they are dancing to is Harry Connick Jr.'s rendition of "I Could Write A Book," which finds the appropriate lyrics, "how to make two lovers of friends." Still, the couple does not consummate. Time passes. They try to set each other up with their best friends through a double blind dateanother scene in which Crystal and Ryan tell the story with their eyes. And we recognize Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher as the perfect players of the "other couple." Finally, Harry and Sally have sex, and we learn the real reason why men and women can never remain "just friends." It's not because the man will always want to have sex with the woman; it's because, once they have sex, the woman will attach more meaning to the act than the man. This answer raises another question: when does, or why should, sex mean something, and when does, or why should, it mean everything? The film doesn't really answer this question, but at least it asks it. Instead, it ends in textbook romantic fashion, with Sally standing alone at midnight on another New Year's Eve, and Harry running through the streets to meet her once again, this time forever, as Frank Sinatra serenades them with "It Had To Be You," instrumental variations of which have accompanied moments throughout the movie. We may be tempted to view the final scene as the only unoriginal one, but I like to appreciate it as a dual realizationpart Harry's, and part oursthat he, and the movie he lives in, really do, after all, believe in true love.

    When Harry Met Sally is a romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner. It stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan together with Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. The story follows the title characters from the time they meet just before sharing a cross-country drive, through twelve years or so of chance encounters in New York City. The film opens with the two strangers,Harry and Sally.Both newly graduated from the University of Chicago, share a car trip from Chicago to New York, where they are both going to make their way. During the trip, they discuss aspects of their characters and their lives, eventually deciding it is impossible for men and women to be "just friends." They arrive in New York and go their separate ways. They meet a few years later on an airplane and Harry reveals he is married. They meet again at a bookstore a few years after that where Harry reveals he is now divorced. From that point on, the two form a friendship. Eventually their closeness results in their respective best friends meeting and falling in love with each other. At a New Year's Eve party Harry and Sally confront the complex tangle of emotions they feel for each other. This is a classic romantic comedy.It is a touching and funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies, and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.And what makes this a classic despite the story's predictability, is the dialogue and the chemistry, which makes for a high-wire act.Most of all,it presents question and provokes thought to both men and women.
