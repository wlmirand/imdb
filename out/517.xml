    This movie will always have a special place in my heart. I will always remember this as the movie that made me want to become a filmmaker myself. But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie. Probably the first thing you will notice is that "Manhattan" was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. "Rhapsody in Blue" fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence. This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In "Manhattan" you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, "Gossip is the new pornography." We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say "Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know." That quote might some up the whole movie for you. I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think "Manhattan" is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

    Ironically a film that is arguably his greatest achievements as a director is also a film that woody Allen so adamantly detested and tried to prevent from being release. But thank god for me, and for the rest of humanity, that it never happened, because for me it's the greatest film I have ever seen, combination of beautiful soundtracks, amazing cinematography and great writing. Almost modern day reimagining of one of Shakespeare's plays titled Midnight Summers Night Dream. Similarities lay in the premise where people who are currently with in a relationship, but still yearning to be with somebody else. One relationship in particular is between 42 year old, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) and 17 year old Mariel Hemingway  she was nominated for both an Oscar and a BAFTA for her performance. But as the film progresses Isaac, begins to grow disillusioned with his relationship with Tracey, which coincides with his growing attraction to the girl his best-friends is cheating on his wife with Diane Keaton  you seeing the Midnight Summers Night Dream link yet? But this isn't the first time Keaton and Allen have been on screen together, this dream team have teamed up on 5 occasions, of most merit is a film Allen wrote and directed, Annie Hall - Seen by most as the second greatest romance film in history, after Casablanca. For a film shot in black and white it is absolutely brimming with colour, such are the powerful yet elegant anaesthetics, combined with dysfunctional yet, very real and relatable characters, Woody Allen masterminds a visceral piece of film literature.

    It is a brilliant film, one of the best films from a brilliant writer, producer, director and actor Woody Allen! It is witty and comic, a simple story of simple people in new york, don't be put off by the fact it was filmed in black and white, the effect of it is brilliant! A Real Must See!I thurely enjoyed this film and think on IMDb it is underrated, in fact i think this film is underrated almost everywhere, don't believe what you here from other people, newspapers and critics almost always fail to see a brilliant film even if it is thrust in front of their face, they are nit picky and never give a film all its deserved credit! I also enjoyed many other films by Woody Allen, films like 'the purple rose of Cairo' and 'midnight in Paris' are very good films to watch.

    Woody Allen's Manhattan is proof that the smallest things do in fact make a film great, even when they're put to use in a projects that seems as if it could do no wrong. To put it simply, this is a glorious film, that utilizes character development, poignancy, deep thought, personal flaws, and love to tell a story that is one for the history books of cinema. The film focuses on forty-two year old, comedy writer Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) who is going out with seventeen year old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Tracy views their relationship as a precocious one that is directly built off of love. Isaac views it as a passing diversion that will soon be forgotten by the both of them. Isaac feels as if he is the last thinking man in a world that is made up of a cesspool of idiots and pseudo-intellectual mouthbreathers. He winds up meeting Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), who rubs him the wrong way at first, but eventually begins to grow on him for her the intelligence she provides and the waves of passion that seemingly flow off her body. Isaac still continues his relationship with Tracy, even though, at this point, why bother? He personally believes it will go nowhere. Tracy clings to hope that it will go somewhere and frets over the idea it won't and, in the end, feels as if she will soon be facing a dark inevitability of life. The only thing seemingly stopping Isaac from going all the way with Mary is that she is currently dating his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) is dating her. But, then again, it doesn't stop him so much to become romantically invested with her, spending all the time in the world and even having sex; so what is exactly stopping him. This is when Manhattan becomes one of the most involved pictures Allen has ever made. Nothing is truly stopping Isaac, but he is paranoid over small details and sees most everything as either trivial (his relationship with Tracy) or effectively makes it achieve a level of intimacy and success that cannot be passed (his relationship with Mary). Isaac wants his relationship with Mary to pass unfathomable heights that may not exist in reality, and his attachment to Tracy is one out of pure convenience. He is in dire need of a wake up call. Not many filmmakers could portray a relationship between a forty-year-old and a teenager to such great power and believability, and with Woody Allen's reputation as of now, one entering this picture blindly could base the premise too much on reality. The fact is he does a brilliant job taking a controversial subject into light. The scene at the diner between Isaac and Tracy, among many other things, is terrific and captivating and accentuates truly what Allen is about in making deeply involved human dramas. Combine the plot and character elements of the film with amazing black and white photography by Gordon Willis and an amazingly elegant score by George Gershwin and you have a picture that delights on every level for your senses. It's extremely rare a film hit many areas of a film on the head with such confidence and style, but Woody Allen's Manhattan does it and does it boldly, making this one of the best romantic films I have yet to see. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, and Michael Murphy. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    Manhattan is often considered Woody Allen's magnum opus, his great work that has been praised by critics and audiences alike, earning Oscars and a place on the IMDb Top 250 list. Isaac Davis (Allen) is a TV comedy writer who wants to write the great American novel. Despite being 42 and twice divorced he is dating a 17-year-old old girl, Tracey (Mariel Hemingway). His ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep), who left him for another woman, is writing a book about the breakdown of their marriage and after Isaac quits his job he is left cash poor. Despite his relationship with Tracey, Isaac starts to full for another woman, the intelligential but pretentious Mary (Diane Keaton). But she is a woman who is already in a relationship with Isaac's friend, Yale (Michael Murphy). Manhattan is a great looking film with its black and white cinematography highlighting the city, particularly when we get to see the skyline. Combined with Allen's directional approach of long takes and tracking shots gave the film a very classical feel. Allen is very good at letting a conversation flow and letting the actors interact and reaction off each other. Allen assembles an excellent cast who play their roles perfectly. They all worked well together and were very believable, even Hemingway as nice, a little na&iuml;ve teenager who is somehow in a relationship with a man 25 years her senior. Streep role was small but was the professional she always is and Keaton was very different to her role in Annie Hall. When compared to Allen's previous film Annie Hall Manhattan is much more grounded and it is more of a drama then a comedy. There are some funny lines but they are much sparer. But there are some comparisons to Annie Hall, we have similar characters like Yale being a little like Rob in Annie Hall and Allen continues his assault on both mainstream TV comedy and pretentiousness. Like Annie Hall attacks Allen pretentious intelligentialism when talking about art and Allen has a continued love for Ingmar Bergman: but Allen's character is equally as pretentious as Mary yet he gets a free pass. Isaac comes up across as a very selfish and narcissistic character, he only cared about himself and willing to step over other people for his interests. All the characters selfish as they have affairs with each other and want to have the best of both worlds, like Yale who wants Mary whilst stay with his wife. SPOILER: I felt that Isaac's wanting to be with Tracey at the end was a very selfish and basically picked because he just wanted to be with somewhere. Only Tracey comes off in a good light because she has an idealised view of romance and relationships, willing to do anything for Isaac before gaining experience and knowledge from the relationship. I can see why people do like the film but I personally felt it was overrated. Compared to Annie Hall Manhattan lacked heart and passion and felt a much colder film. It is higher to sympathise with the characters in this looser narrative that film has to offer.

    Manhattan-**** (out of 4): Woody Allen broke his strictly comic image with 1977's "Annie Hall" and he followed that effort up with this masterpiece, a work of such beautiful cinematography, pitch-perfect writing, and an unforgettable cast. The opening black and white scenes of Manhattan, set to the pitch of "Rhapsody in Blue" by George Gershwin makes NYC come alive like it never has before. Then, we get to the story, with a group of neurotic New Yorkers struggling to keep their emotional lives in tact. Mariel Hemingway is absolutely fantastic above all the others, she breathes pure sensitivity into her part as Woody's teen-aged lover. "Manhattan" was Allen's first effort to capture the spirit of NYC as a whole and its intellectual community. However, this film functions as more than a love note to New York, it also is a highly personal movie about romance, friendship, and intellectual angst.

    I would say that this review contains a "spoiler" except that would mean the film actually contained a plot. This is on my top ten worst movies list. It is a pointless movie with poor acting and no real point. For all of those who enjoyed the film..... I ask "what was there to enjoy"? Apparently I wasn't smoking the same the same thing you were. This movie is about adultery and fornication with a minor. I am also confused about another thing. Supposedly this film is a Drama and a Comedy. I found nothing comedy worthy in the film nor anything that I would consider drama. The film was about the very boring life of a very boring writer, who has very questionable morals. I enjoyed some of the cinematography but the film itself was crap.

    It seems Woody Allen wanted to denounce the pseudo-intellectualism, yet Manhattan is overly arrogant, like its ultra verbose dialogues, based on almost ridiculous, pedant and excluding accumulations of art references. The viewer finds himself enduring this long and boring movie, oozing self-sufficiency, which script boils down to a succession of scenes more boring one from another. The different angles don't work, or with difficulty: it is sometimes funny but it is too sporadic, the drama lacks stakes; only the romance aspect manages not too badly, and still, it is far from excellent. If there was anything to save, it would be the stylish cinematography with some well thought-out shots, but it's just not enough to make Manhattan a good film.

    **1/2 out of **** Probably Woody Allen's most overrated work. I've seen MANHATTAN a few times now and I'll be damned if I'm still not sure what the point of it is. Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, SLEEPER and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not. The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by "middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?).

    Being only the age of Mariel Hemingway's character in the movie, I've only recently discovered Woody Allen, and after watching and obsessing over Midnight in Paris and (especially) Annie Hall, I thought I should check out some of Allen's other films. I wanted to start with Sweet and Lowdown (because that's my favorite Gershwin piece and it sounded kind of awesome), which seems to be one of his lesser-known movies, but it wasn't on instant Netflix so I turned to Manhattan. It's set to a strictly Gershwin soundtrack, it's a post-Technicolor black and white film, and it reunites Woody Allen and Diane Keaton- what more could I ask for? As it turns out, a lot. Watching this film was very much, for me, like visiting New York City for the first time. I had heard about New York from Frank Sinatra, seen it in Breakfast at Tiffany's, walked its streets with Holden Caulfield, but when I stepped foot in Manhattan for the first time, I wasn't in Manhattan at all. I was in a dingy city lit up by too many wasted watts of electricity, a city with too many McDonalds and not enough trees. A woman actually blew cigarette smoke in my face and everything! I wasn't in New York City at all, because New York City doesn't really exist, except for in Woody Allen movies and those sorts of things. And so it goes with Manhattan. Here it was, inarguably Allen's magnum opus, his love letter to dear New York City, a guest at the Oscars- but it wasn't. I was hoping for the witty writing, the stand-up comedian sort of humor I had come to expect after watching Annie Hall, but it all seemed very old hat to me, like a watered-down version of Woody Allen movie. I don't mean to sound awful, but I can't help but wonder if he wrote the script just so he could film romantic scenes with someone twenty years younger than himself. And God was it pretentious. It was so pretentious. I'm all for allusions to art or literature or what have you ("your self-confidence is a notch below Kafka's"- that line- sorry if it isn't verbatim- did make me laugh), but nobody in real life goes on about van Gogh (gah?) and all the way Keaton's character did. Well, maybe people in New York City do.

But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie. Probably the first thing you will notice is that "Manhattan" was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. "Rhapsody in Blue" fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence. This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In "Manhattan" you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, "Gossip is the new pornography." We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say "Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know." That quote might some up the whole movie for you. I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think "Manhattan" is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

Isaac comes up across as a very selfish and narcissistic character, he only cared about himself and willing to step over other people for his interests. All the characters selfish as they have affairs with each other and want to have the best of both worlds, like Yale who wants Mary whilst stay with his wife. SPOILER: I felt that Isaac's wanting to be with Tracey at the end was a very selfish and basically picked because he just wanted to be with somewhere. Only Tracey comes off in a good light because she has an idealised view of romance and relationships, willing to do anything for Isaac before gaining experience and knowledge from the relationship. I can see why people do like the film but I personally felt it was overrated. Compared to Annie Hall Manhattan lacked heart and passion and felt a much colder film. It is higher to sympathise with the characters in this looser narrative that film has to offer.

    Manhattan-**** (out of 4): Woody Allen broke his strictly comic image with 1977's "Annie Hall" and he followed that effort up with this masterpiece, a work of such beautiful cinematography, pitch-perfect writing, and an unforgettable cast. The opening black and white scenes of Manhattan, set to the pitch of "Rhapsody in Blue" by George Gershwin makes NYC come alive like it never has before. Then, we get to the story, with a group of neurotic New Yorkers struggling to keep their emotional lives in tact. Mariel Hemingway is absolutely fantastic above all the others, she breathes pure sensitivity into her part as Woody's teen-aged lover. "Manhattan" was Allen's first effort to capture the spirit of NYC as a whole and its intellectual community. However, this film functions as more than a love note to New York, it also is a highly personal movie about romance, friendship, and intellectual angst.

    I would say that this review contains a "spoiler" except that would mean the film actually contained a plot. This is on my top ten worst movies list. It is a pointless movie with poor acting and no real point. For all of those who enjoyed the film..... I ask "what was there to enjoy"? Apparently I wasn't smoking the same the same thing you were. This movie is about adultery and fornication with a minor. I am also confused about another thing. Supposedly this film is a Drama and a Comedy. I found nothing comedy worthy in the film nor anything that I would consider drama. The film was about the very boring life of a very boring writer, who has very questionable morals. I enjoyed some of the cinematography but the film itself was crap.

    It seems Woody Allen wanted to denounce the pseudo-intellectualism, yet Manhattan is overly arrogant, like its ultra verbose dialogues, based on almost ridiculous, pedant and excluding accumulations of art references. The viewer finds himself enduring this long and boring movie, oozing self-sufficiency, which script boils down to a succession of scenes more boring one from another. The different angles don't work, or with difficulty: it is sometimes funny but it is too sporadic, the drama lacks stakes; only the romance aspect manages not too badly, and still, it is far from excellent. If there was anything to save, it would be the stylish cinematography with some well thought-out shots, but it's just not enough to make Manhattan a good film.

    **1/2 out of **** Probably Woody Allen's most overrated work. I've seen MANHATTAN a few times now and I'll be damned if I'm still not sure what the point of it is. Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, SLEEPER and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not. The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by "middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?).

    Being only the age of Mariel Hemingway's character in the movie, I've only recently discovered Woody Allen, and after watching and obsessing over Midnight in Paris and (especially) Annie Hall, I thought I should check out some of Allen's other films. I wanted to start with Sweet and Lowdown (because that's my favorite Gershwin piece and it sounded kind of awesome), which seems to be one of his lesser-known movies, but it wasn't on instant Netflix so I turned to Manhattan. It's set to a strictly Gershwin soundtrack, it's a post-Technicolor black and white film, and it reunites Woody Allen and Diane Keaton- what more could I ask for? As it turns out, a lot. Watching this film was very much, for me, like visiting New York City for the first time. I had heard about New York from Frank Sinatra, seen it in Breakfast at Tiffany's, walked its streets with Holden Caulfield, but when I stepped foot in Manhattan for the first time, I wasn't in Manhattan at all. I was in a dingy city lit up by too many wasted watts of electricity, a city with too many McDonalds and not enough trees. A woman actually blew cigarette smoke in my face and everything! I wasn't in New York City at all, because New York City doesn't really exist, except for in Woody Allen movies and those sorts of things. And so it goes with Manhattan. Here it was, inarguably Allen's magnum opus, his love letter to dear New York City, a guest at the Oscars- but it wasn't. I was hoping for the witty writing, the stand-up comedian sort of humor I had come to expect after watching Annie Hall, but it all seemed very old hat to me, like a watered-down version of Woody Allen movie. I don't mean to sound awful, but I can't help but wonder if he wrote the script just so he could film romantic scenes with someone twenty years younger than himself. And God was it pretentious. It was so pretentious. I'm all for allusions to art or literature or what have you ("your self-confidence is a notch below Kafka's"- that line- sorry if it isn't verbatim- did make me laugh), but nobody in real life goes on about van Gogh (gah?) and all the way Keaton's character did. Well, maybe people in New York City do.

    This movie will always have a special place in my heart. I will always remember this as the movie that made me want to become a filmmaker myself. But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie. Probably the first thing you will notice is that "Manhattan" was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. "Rhapsody in Blue" fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence. This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In "Manhattan" you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, "Gossip is the new pornography." We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say "Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know." That quote might some up the whole movie for you. I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think "Manhattan" is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

    Ironically a film that is arguably his greatest achievements as a director is also a film that woody Allen so adamantly detested and tried to prevent from being release. But thank god for me, and for the rest of humanity, that it never happened, because for me it's the greatest film I have ever seen, combination of beautiful soundtracks, amazing cinematography and great writing. Almost modern day reimagining of one of Shakespeare's plays titled Midnight Summers Night Dream. Similarities lay in the premise where people who are currently with in a relationship, but still yearning to be with somebody else. One relationship in particular is between 42 year old, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) and 17 year old Mariel Hemingway  she was nominated for both an Oscar and a BAFTA for her performance. But as the film progresses Isaac, begins to grow disillusioned with his relationship with Tracey, which coincides with his growing attraction to the girl his best-friends is cheating on his wife with Diane Keaton  you seeing the Midnight Summers Night Dream link yet? But this isn't the first time Keaton and Allen have been on screen together, this dream team have teamed up on 5 occasions, of most merit is a film Allen wrote and directed, Annie Hall - Seen by most as the second greatest romance film in history, after Casablanca. For a film shot in black and white it is absolutely brimming with colour, such are the powerful yet elegant anaesthetics, combined with dysfunctional yet, very real and relatable characters, Woody Allen masterminds a visceral piece of film literature.

    It is a brilliant film, one of the best films from a brilliant writer, producer, director and actor Woody Allen! It is witty and comic, a simple story of simple people in new york, don't be put off by the fact it was filmed in black and white, the effect of it is brilliant! A Real Must See!I thurely enjoyed this film and think on IMDb it is underrated, in fact i think this film is underrated almost everywhere, don't believe what you here from other people, newspapers and critics almost always fail to see a brilliant film even if it is thrust in front of their face, they are nit picky and never give a film all its deserved credit! I also enjoyed many other films by Woody Allen, films like 'the purple rose of Cairo' and 'midnight in Paris' are very good films to watch.

    Woody Allen's Manhattan is proof that the smallest things do in fact make a film great, even when they're put to use in a projects that seems as if it could do no wrong. To put it simply, this is a glorious film, that utilizes character development, poignancy, deep thought, personal flaws, and love to tell a story that is one for the history books of cinema. The film focuses on forty-two year old, comedy writer Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) who is going out with seventeen year old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Tracy views their relationship as a precocious one that is directly built off of love. Isaac views it as a passing diversion that will soon be forgotten by the both of them. Isaac feels as if he is the last thinking man in a world that is made up of a cesspool of idiots and pseudo-intellectual mouthbreathers. He winds up meeting Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), who rubs him the wrong way at first, but eventually begins to grow on him for her the intelligence she provides and the waves of passion that seemingly flow off her body. Isaac still continues his relationship with Tracy, even though, at this point, why bother? He personally believes it will go nowhere. Tracy clings to hope that it will go somewhere and frets over the idea it won't and, in the end, feels as if she will soon be facing a dark inevitability of life. The only thing seemingly stopping Isaac from going all the way with Mary is that she is currently dating his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) is dating her. But, then again, it doesn't stop him so much to become romantically invested with her, spending all the time in the world and even having sex; so what is exactly stopping him. This is when Manhattan becomes one of the most involved pictures Allen has ever made. Nothing is truly stopping Isaac, but he is paranoid over small details and sees most everything as either trivial (his relationship with Tracy) or effectively makes it achieve a level of intimacy and success that cannot be passed (his relationship with Mary). Isaac wants his relationship with Mary to pass unfathomable heights that may not exist in reality, and his attachment to Tracy is one out of pure convenience. He is in dire need of a wake up call. Not many filmmakers could portray a relationship between a forty-year-old and a teenager to such great power and believability, and with Woody Allen's reputation as of now, one entering this picture blindly could base the premise too much on reality. The fact is he does a brilliant job taking a controversial subject into light. The scene at the diner between Isaac and Tracy, among many other things, is terrific and captivating and accentuates truly what Allen is about in making deeply involved human dramas. Combine the plot and character elements of the film with amazing black and white photography by Gordon Willis and an amazingly elegant score by George Gershwin and you have a picture that delights on every level for your senses. It's extremely rare a film hit many areas of a film on the head with such confidence and style, but Woody Allen's Manhattan does it and does it boldly, making this one of the best romantic films I have yet to see. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, and Michael Murphy. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    Manhattan is often considered Woody Allen's magnum opus, his great work that has been praised by critics and audiences alike, earning Oscars and a place on the IMDb Top 250 list. Isaac Davis (Allen) is a TV comedy writer who wants to write the great American novel. Despite being 42 and twice divorced he is dating a 17-year-old old girl, Tracey (Mariel Hemingway). His ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep), who left him for another woman, is writing a book about the breakdown of their marriage and after Isaac quits his job he is left cash poor. Despite his relationship with Tracey, Isaac starts to full for another woman, the intelligential but pretentious Mary (Diane Keaton). But she is a woman who is already in a relationship with Isaac's friend, Yale (Michael Murphy). Manhattan is a great looking film with its black and white cinematography highlighting the city, particularly when we get to see the skyline. Combined with Allen's directional approach of long takes and tracking shots gave the film a very classical feel. Allen is very good at letting a conversation flow and letting the actors interact and reaction off each other. Allen assembles an excellent cast who play their roles perfectly. They all worked well together and were very believable, even Hemingway as nice, a little na&iuml;ve teenager who is somehow in a relationship with a man 25 years her senior. Streep role was small but was the professional she always is and Keaton was very different to her role in Annie Hall. When compared to Allen's previous film Annie Hall Manhattan is much more grounded and it is more of a drama then a comedy. There are some funny lines but they are much sparer. But there are some comparisons to Annie Hall, we have similar characters like Yale being a little like Rob in Annie Hall and Allen continues his assault on both mainstream TV comedy and pretentiousness. Like Annie Hall attacks Allen pretentious intelligentialism when talking about art and Allen has a continued love for Ingmar Bergman: but Allen's character is equally as pretentious as Mary yet he gets a free pass. Isaac comes up across as a very selfish and narcissistic character, he only cared about himself and willing to step over other people for his interests. All the characters selfish as they have affairs with each other and want to have the best of both worlds, like Yale who wants Mary whilst stay with his wife. SPOILER: I felt that Isaac's wanting to be with Tracey at the end was a very selfish and basically picked because he just wanted to be with somewhere. Only Tracey comes off in a good light because she has an idealised view of romance and relationships, willing to do anything for Isaac before gaining experience and knowledge from the relationship. I can see why people do like the film but I personally felt it was overrated. Compared to Annie Hall Manhattan lacked heart and passion and felt a much colder film. It is higher to sympathise with the characters in this looser narrative that film has to offer.

    **1/2 out of **** Probably Woody Allen's most overrated work. I've seen MANHATTAN a few times now and I'll be damned if I'm still not sure what the point of it is. Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, SLEEPER and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not. The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by "middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?).

    This movie will always have a special place in my heart. I will always remember this as the movie that made me want to become a filmmaker myself. But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie. Probably the first thing you will notice is that "Manhattan" was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. "Rhapsody in Blue" fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence. This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In "Manhattan" you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, "Gossip is the new pornography." We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say "Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know." That quote might some up the whole movie for you. I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think "Manhattan" is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

    Ironically a film that is arguably his greatest achievements as a director is also a film that woody Allen so adamantly detested and tried to prevent from being release. But thank god for me, and for the rest of humanity, that it never happened, because for me it's the greatest film I have ever seen, combination of beautiful soundtracks, amazing cinematography and great writing. Almost modern day reimagining of one of Shakespeare's plays titled Midnight Summers Night Dream. Similarities lay in the premise where people who are currently with in a relationship, but still yearning to be with somebody else. One relationship in particular is between 42 year old, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) and 17 year old Mariel Hemingway  she was nominated for both an Oscar and a BAFTA for her performance. But as the film progresses Isaac, begins to grow disillusioned with his relationship with Tracey, which coincides with his growing attraction to the girl his best-friends is cheating on his wife with Diane Keaton  you seeing the Midnight Summers Night Dream link yet? But this isn't the first time Keaton and Allen have been on screen together, this dream team have teamed up on 5 occasions, of most merit is a film Allen wrote and directed, Annie Hall - Seen by most as the second greatest romance film in history, after Casablanca. For a film shot in black and white it is absolutely brimming with colour, such are the powerful yet elegant anaesthetics, combined with dysfunctional yet, very real and relatable characters, Woody Allen masterminds a visceral piece of film literature.

    It is a brilliant film, one of the best films from a brilliant writer, producer, director and actor Woody Allen! It is witty and comic, a simple story of simple people in new york, don't be put off by the fact it was filmed in black and white, the effect of it is brilliant! A Real Must See!I thurely enjoyed this film and think on IMDb it is underrated, in fact i think this film is underrated almost everywhere, don't believe what you here from other people, newspapers and critics almost always fail to see a brilliant film even if it is thrust in front of their face, they are nit picky and never give a film all its deserved credit! I also enjoyed many other films by Woody Allen, films like 'the purple rose of Cairo' and 'midnight in Paris' are very good films to watch.

    Woody Allen's Manhattan is proof that the smallest things do in fact make a film great, even when they're put to use in a projects that seems as if it could do no wrong. To put it simply, this is a glorious film, that utilizes character development, poignancy, deep thought, personal flaws, and love to tell a story that is one for the history books of cinema. The film focuses on forty-two year old, comedy writer Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) who is going out with seventeen year old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Tracy views their relationship as a precocious one that is directly built off of love. Isaac views it as a passing diversion that will soon be forgotten by the both of them. Isaac feels as if he is the last thinking man in a world that is made up of a cesspool of idiots and pseudo-intellectual mouthbreathers. He winds up meeting Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), who rubs him the wrong way at first, but eventually begins to grow on him for her the intelligence she provides and the waves of passion that seemingly flow off her body. Isaac still continues his relationship with Tracy, even though, at this point, why bother? He personally believes it will go nowhere. Tracy clings to hope that it will go somewhere and frets over the idea it won't and, in the end, feels as if she will soon be facing a dark inevitability of life. The only thing seemingly stopping Isaac from going all the way with Mary is that she is currently dating his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) is dating her. But, then again, it doesn't stop him so much to become romantically invested with her, spending all the time in the world and even having sex; so what is exactly stopping him. This is when Manhattan becomes one of the most involved pictures Allen has ever made. Nothing is truly stopping Isaac, but he is paranoid over small details and sees most everything as either trivial (his relationship with Tracy) or effectively makes it achieve a level of intimacy and success that cannot be passed (his relationship with Mary). Isaac wants his relationship with Mary to pass unfathomable heights that may not exist in reality, and his attachment to Tracy is one out of pure convenience. He is in dire need of a wake up call. Not many filmmakers could portray a relationship between a forty-year-old and a teenager to such great power and believability, and with Woody Allen's reputation as of now, one entering this picture blindly could base the premise too much on reality. The fact is he does a brilliant job taking a controversial subject into light. The scene at the diner between Isaac and Tracy, among many other things, is terrific and captivating and accentuates truly what Allen is about in making deeply involved human dramas. Combine the plot and character elements of the film with amazing black and white photography by Gordon Willis and an amazingly elegant score by George Gershwin and you have a picture that delights on every level for your senses. It's extremely rare a film hit many areas of a film on the head with such confidence and style, but Woody Allen's Manhattan does it and does it boldly, making this one of the best romantic films I have yet to see. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, and Michael Murphy. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    Manhattan is often considered Woody Allen's magnum opus, his great work that has been praised by critics and audiences alike, earning Oscars and a place on the IMDb Top 250 list. Isaac Davis (Allen) is a TV comedy writer who wants to write the great American novel. Despite being 42 and twice divorced he is dating a 17-year-old old girl, Tracey (Mariel Hemingway). His ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep), who left him for another woman, is writing a book about the breakdown of their marriage and after Isaac quits his job he is left cash poor. Despite his relationship with Tracey, Isaac starts to full for another woman, the intelligential but pretentious Mary (Diane Keaton). But she is a woman who is already in a relationship with Isaac's friend, Yale (Michael Murphy). Manhattan is a great looking film with its black and white cinematography highlighting the city, particularly when we get to see the skyline. Combined with Allen's directional approach of long takes and tracking shots gave the film a very classical feel. Allen is very good at letting a conversation flow and letting the actors interact and reaction off each other. Allen assembles an excellent cast who play their roles perfectly. They all worked well together and were very believable, even Hemingway as nice, a little na&iuml;ve teenager who is somehow in a relationship with a man 25 years her senior. Streep role was small but was the professional she always is and Keaton was very different to her role in Annie Hall. When compared to Allen's previous film Annie Hall Manhattan is much more grounded and it is more of a drama then a comedy. There are some funny lines but they are much sparer. But there are some comparisons to Annie Hall, we have similar characters like Yale being a little like Rob in Annie Hall and Allen continues his assault on both mainstream TV comedy and pretentiousness. Like Annie Hall attacks Allen pretentious intelligentialism when talking about art and Allen has a continued love for Ingmar Bergman: but Allen's character is equally as pretentious as Mary yet he gets a free pass. Isaac comes up across as a very selfish and narcissistic character, he only cared about himself and willing to step over other people for his interests. All the characters selfish as they have affairs with each other and want to have the best of both worlds, like Yale who wants Mary whilst stay with his wife. SPOILER: I felt that Isaac's wanting to be with Tracey at the end was a very selfish and basically picked because he just wanted to be with somewhere. Only Tracey comes off in a good light because she has an idealised view of romance and relationships, willing to do anything for Isaac before gaining experience and knowledge from the relationship. I can see why people do like the film but I personally felt it was overrated. Compared to Annie Hall Manhattan lacked heart and passion and felt a much colder film. It is higher to sympathise with the characters in this looser narrative that film has to offer.

    Manhattan-**** (out of 4): Woody Allen broke his strictly comic image with 1977's "Annie Hall" and he followed that effort up with this masterpiece, a work of such beautiful cinematography, pitch-perfect writing, and an unforgettable cast. The opening black and white scenes of Manhattan, set to the pitch of "Rhapsody in Blue" by George Gershwin makes NYC come alive like it never has before. Then, we get to the story, with a group of neurotic New Yorkers struggling to keep their emotional lives in tact. Mariel Hemingway is absolutely fantastic above all the others, she breathes pure sensitivity into her part as Woody's teen-aged lover. "Manhattan" was Allen's first effort to capture the spirit of NYC as a whole and its intellectual community. However, this film functions as more than a love note to New York, it also is a highly personal movie about romance, friendship, and intellectual angst.

    I would say that this review contains a "spoiler" except that would mean the film actually contained a plot. This is on my top ten worst movies list. It is a pointless movie with poor acting and no real point. For all of those who enjoyed the film..... I ask "what was there to enjoy"? Apparently I wasn't smoking the same the same thing you were. This movie is about adultery and fornication with a minor. I am also confused about another thing. Supposedly this film is a Drama and a Comedy. I found nothing comedy worthy in the film nor anything that I would consider drama. The film was about the very boring life of a very boring writer, who has very questionable morals. I enjoyed some of the cinematography but the film itself was crap.

    It seems Woody Allen wanted to denounce the pseudo-intellectualism, yet Manhattan is overly arrogant, like its ultra verbose dialogues, based on almost ridiculous, pedant and excluding accumulations of art references. The viewer finds himself enduring this long and boring movie, oozing self-sufficiency, which script boils down to a succession of scenes more boring one from another. The different angles don't work, or with difficulty: it is sometimes funny but it is too sporadic, the drama lacks stakes; only the romance aspect manages not too badly, and still, it is far from excellent. If there was anything to save, it would be the stylish cinematography with some well thought-out shots, but it's just not enough to make Manhattan a good film.

    **1/2 out of **** Probably Woody Allen's most overrated work. I've seen MANHATTAN a few times now and I'll be damned if I'm still not sure what the point of it is. Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, SLEEPER and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not. The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by "middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?).

    Being only the age of Mariel Hemingway's character in the movie, I've only recently discovered Woody Allen, and after watching and obsessing over Midnight in Paris and (especially) Annie Hall, I thought I should check out some of Allen's other films. I wanted to start with Sweet and Lowdown (because that's my favorite Gershwin piece and it sounded kind of awesome), which seems to be one of his lesser-known movies, but it wasn't on instant Netflix so I turned to Manhattan. It's set to a strictly Gershwin soundtrack, it's a post-Technicolor black and white film, and it reunites Woody Allen and Diane Keaton- what more could I ask for? As it turns out, a lot. Watching this film was very much, for me, like visiting New York City for the first time. I had heard about New York from Frank Sinatra, seen it in Breakfast at Tiffany's, walked its streets with Holden Caulfield, but when I stepped foot in Manhattan for the first time, I wasn't in Manhattan at all. I was in a dingy city lit up by too many wasted watts of electricity, a city with too many McDonalds and not enough trees. A woman actually blew cigarette smoke in my face and everything! I wasn't in New York City at all, because New York City doesn't really exist, except for in Woody Allen movies and those sorts of things. And so it goes with Manhattan. Here it was, inarguably Allen's magnum opus, his love letter to dear New York City, a guest at the Oscars- but it wasn't. I was hoping for the witty writing, the stand-up comedian sort of humor I had come to expect after watching Annie Hall, but it all seemed very old hat to me, like a watered-down version of Woody Allen movie. I don't mean to sound awful, but I can't help but wonder if he wrote the script just so he could film romantic scenes with someone twenty years younger than himself. And God was it pretentious. It was so pretentious. I'm all for allusions to art or literature or what have you ("your self-confidence is a notch below Kafka's"- that line- sorry if it isn't verbatim- did make me laugh), but nobody in real life goes on about van Gogh (gah?) and all the way Keaton's character did. Well, maybe people in New York City do.

    This movie will always have a special place in my heart. I will always remember this as the movie that made me want to become a filmmaker myself. But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie. Probably the first thing you will notice is that "Manhattan" was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. "Rhapsody in Blue" fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence. This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In "Manhattan" you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, "Gossip is the new pornography." We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say "Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know." That quote might some up the whole movie for you. I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think "Manhattan" is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

    Ironically a film that is arguably his greatest achievements as a director is also a film that woody Allen so adamantly detested and tried to prevent from being release. But thank god for me, and for the rest of humanity, that it never happened, because for me it's the greatest film I have ever seen, combination of beautiful soundtracks, amazing cinematography and great writing. Almost modern day reimagining of one of Shakespeare's plays titled Midnight Summers Night Dream. Similarities lay in the premise where people who are currently with in a relationship, but still yearning to be with somebody else. One relationship in particular is between 42 year old, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) and 17 year old Mariel Hemingway  she was nominated for both an Oscar and a BAFTA for her performance. But as the film progresses Isaac, begins to grow disillusioned with his relationship with Tracey, which coincides with his growing attraction to the girl his best-friends is cheating on his wife with Diane Keaton  you seeing the Midnight Summers Night Dream link yet? But this isn't the first time Keaton and Allen have been on screen together, this dream team have teamed up on 5 occasions, of most merit is a film Allen wrote and directed, Annie Hall - Seen by most as the second greatest romance film in history, after Casablanca. For a film shot in black and white it is absolutely brimming with colour, such are the powerful yet elegant anaesthetics, combined with dysfunctional yet, very real and relatable characters, Woody Allen masterminds a visceral piece of film literature.

    **1/2 out of **** Probably Woody Allen's most overrated work. I've seen MANHATTAN a few times now and I'll be damned if I'm still not sure what the point of it is. Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, SLEEPER and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not. The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by "middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?).

    Being only the age of Mariel Hemingway's character in the movie, I've only recently discovered Woody Allen, and after watching and obsessing over Midnight in Paris and (especially) Annie Hall, I thought I should check out some of Allen's other films. I wanted to start with Sweet and Lowdown (because that's my favorite Gershwin piece and it sounded kind of awesome), which seems to be one of his lesser-known movies, but it wasn't on instant Netflix so I turned to Manhattan. It's set to a strictly Gershwin soundtrack, it's a post-Technicolor black and white film, and it reunites Woody Allen and Diane Keaton- what more could I ask for? As it turns out, a lot. Watching this film was very much, for me, like visiting New York City for the first time. I had heard about New York from Frank Sinatra, seen it in Breakfast at Tiffany's, walked its streets with Holden Caulfield, but when I stepped foot in Manhattan for the first time, I wasn't in Manhattan at all. I was in a dingy city lit up by too many wasted watts of electricity, a city with too many McDonalds and not enough trees. A woman actually blew cigarette smoke in my face and everything! I wasn't in New York City at all, because New York City doesn't really exist, except for in Woody Allen movies and those sorts of things. And so it goes with Manhattan. Here it was, inarguably Allen's magnum opus, his love letter to dear New York City, a guest at the Oscars- but it wasn't. I was hoping for the witty writing, the stand-up comedian sort of humor I had come to expect after watching Annie Hall, but it all seemed very old hat to me, like a watered-down version of Woody Allen movie. I don't mean to sound awful, but I can't help but wonder if he wrote the script just so he could film romantic scenes with someone twenty years younger than himself. And God was it pretentious. It was so pretentious. I'm all for allusions to art or literature or what have you ("your self-confidence is a notch below Kafka's"- that line- sorry if it isn't verbatim- did make me laugh), but nobody in real life goes on about van Gogh (gah?) and all the way Keaton's character did. Well, maybe people in New York City do.

    This movie will always have a special place in my heart. I will always remember this as the movie that made me want to become a filmmaker myself. But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie. Probably the first thing you will notice is that "Manhattan" was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. "Rhapsody in Blue" fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence. This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In "Manhattan" you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, "Gossip is the new pornography." We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say "Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know." That quote might some up the whole movie for you. I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think "Manhattan" is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

    Ironically a film that is arguably his greatest achievements as a director is also a film that woody Allen so adamantly detested and tried to prevent from being release. But thank god for me, and for the rest of humanity, that it never happened, because for me it's the greatest film I have ever seen, combination of beautiful soundtracks, amazing cinematography and great writing. Almost modern day reimagining of one of Shakespeare's plays titled Midnight Summers Night Dream. Similarities lay in the premise where people who are currently with in a relationship, but still yearning to be with somebody else. One relationship in particular is between 42 year old, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) and 17 year old Mariel Hemingway  she was nominated for both an Oscar and a BAFTA for her performance. But as the film progresses Isaac, begins to grow disillusioned with his relationship with Tracey, which coincides with his growing attraction to the girl his best-friends is cheating on his wife with Diane Keaton  you seeing the Midnight Summers Night Dream link yet? But this isn't the first time Keaton and Allen have been on screen together, this dream team have teamed up on 5 occasions, of most merit is a film Allen wrote and directed, Annie Hall - Seen by most as the second greatest romance film in history, after Casablanca. For a film shot in black and white it is absolutely brimming with colour, such are the powerful yet elegant anaesthetics, combined with dysfunctional yet, very real and relatable characters, Woody Allen masterminds a visceral piece of film literature.

    It is a brilliant film, one of the best films from a brilliant writer, producer, director and actor Woody Allen! It is witty and comic, a simple story of simple people in new york, don't be put off by the fact it was filmed in black and white, the effect of it is brilliant! A Real Must See!I thurely enjoyed this film and think on IMDb it is underrated, in fact i think this film is underrated almost everywhere, don't believe what you here from other people, newspapers and critics almost always fail to see a brilliant film even if it is thrust in front of their face, they are nit picky and never give a film all its deserved credit! I also enjoyed many other films by Woody Allen, films like 'the purple rose of Cairo' and 'midnight in Paris' are very good films to watch.

    Woody Allen's Manhattan is proof that the smallest things do in fact make a film great, even when they're put to use in a projects that seems as if it could do no wrong. To put it simply, this is a glorious film, that utilizes character development, poignancy, deep thought, personal flaws, and love to tell a story that is one for the history books of cinema. The film focuses on forty-two year old, comedy writer Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) who is going out with seventeen year old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Tracy views their relationship as a precocious one that is directly built off of love. Isaac views it as a passing diversion that will soon be forgotten by the both of them. Isaac feels as if he is the last thinking man in a world that is made up of a cesspool of idiots and pseudo-intellectual mouthbreathers. He winds up meeting Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), who rubs him the wrong way at first, but eventually begins to grow on him for her the intelligence she provides and the waves of passion that seemingly flow off her body. Isaac still continues his relationship with Tracy, even though, at this point, why bother? He personally believes it will go nowhere. Tracy clings to hope that it will go somewhere and frets over the idea it won't and, in the end, feels as if she will soon be facing a dark inevitability of life. The only thing seemingly stopping Isaac from going all the way with Mary is that she is currently dating his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) is dating her. But, then again, it doesn't stop him so much to become romantically invested with her, spending all the time in the world and even having sex; so what is exactly stopping him. This is when Manhattan becomes one of the most involved pictures Allen has ever made. Nothing is truly stopping Isaac, but he is paranoid over small details and sees most everything as either trivial (his relationship with Tracy) or effectively makes it achieve a level of intimacy and success that cannot be passed (his relationship with Mary). Isaac wants his relationship with Mary to pass unfathomable heights that may not exist in reality, and his attachment to Tracy is one out of pure convenience. He is in dire need of a wake up call. Not many filmmakers could portray a relationship between a forty-year-old and a teenager to such great power and believability, and with Woody Allen's reputation as of now, one entering this picture blindly could base the premise too much on reality. The fact is he does a brilliant job taking a controversial subject into light. The scene at the diner between Isaac and Tracy, among many other things, is terrific and captivating and accentuates truly what Allen is about in making deeply involved human dramas. Combine the plot and character elements of the film with amazing black and white photography by Gordon Willis and an amazingly elegant score by George Gershwin and you have a picture that delights on every level for your senses. It's extremely rare a film hit many areas of a film on the head with such confidence and style, but Woody Allen's Manhattan does it and does it boldly, making this one of the best romantic films I have yet to see. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, and Michael Murphy. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    Manhattan is often considered Woody Allen's magnum opus, his great work that has been praised by critics and audiences alike, earning Oscars and a place on the IMDb Top 250 list. Isaac Davis (Allen) is a TV comedy writer who wants to write the great American novel. Despite being 42 and twice divorced he is dating a 17-year-old old girl, Tracey (Mariel Hemingway). His ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep), who left him for another woman, is writing a book about the breakdown of their marriage and after Isaac quits his job he is left cash poor. Despite his relationship with Tracey, Isaac starts to full for another woman, the intelligential but pretentious Mary (Diane Keaton). But she is a woman who is already in a relationship with Isaac's friend, Yale (Michael Murphy). Manhattan is a great looking film with its black and white cinematography highlighting the city, particularly when we get to see the skyline. Combined with Allen's directional approach of long takes and tracking shots gave the film a very classical feel. Allen is very good at letting a conversation flow and letting the actors interact and reaction off each other. Allen assembles an excellent cast who play their roles perfectly. They all worked well together and were very believable, even Hemingway as nice, a little na&iuml;ve teenager who is somehow in a relationship with a man 25 years her senior. Streep role was small but was the professional she always is and Keaton was very different to her role in Annie Hall. When compared to Allen's previous film Annie Hall Manhattan is much more grounded and it is more of a drama then a comedy. There are some funny lines but they are much sparer. But there are some comparisons to Annie Hall, we have similar characters like Yale being a little like Rob in Annie Hall and Allen continues his assault on both mainstream TV comedy and pretentiousness. Like Annie Hall attacks Allen pretentious intelligentialism when talking about art and Allen has a continued love for Ingmar Bergman: but Allen's character is equally as pretentious as Mary yet he gets a free pass. Isaac comes up across as a very selfish and narcissistic character, he only cared about himself and willing to step over other people for his interests. All the characters selfish as they have affairs with each other and want to have the best of both worlds, like Yale who wants Mary whilst stay with his wife. SPOILER: I felt that Isaac's wanting to be with Tracey at the end was a very selfish and basically picked because he just wanted to be with somewhere. Only Tracey comes off in a good light because she has an idealised view of romance and relationships, willing to do anything for Isaac before gaining experience and knowledge from the relationship. I can see why people do like the film but I personally felt it was overrated. Compared to Annie Hall Manhattan lacked heart and passion and felt a much colder film. It is higher to sympathise with the characters in this looser narrative that film has to offer.

    Manhattan-**** (out of 4): Woody Allen broke his strictly comic image with 1977's "Annie Hall" and he followed that effort up with this masterpiece, a work of such beautiful cinematography, pitch-perfect writing, and an unforgettable cast. The opening black and white scenes of Manhattan, set to the pitch of "Rhapsody in Blue" by George Gershwin makes NYC come alive like it never has before. Then, we get to the story, with a group of neurotic New Yorkers struggling to keep their emotional lives in tact. Mariel Hemingway is absolutely fantastic above all the others, she breathes pure sensitivity into her part as Woody's teen-aged lover. "Manhattan" was Allen's first effort to capture the spirit of NYC as a whole and its intellectual community. However, this film functions as more than a love note to New York, it also is a highly personal movie about romance, friendship, and intellectual angst.

    I would say that this review contains a "spoiler" except that would mean the film actually contained a plot. This is on my top ten worst movies list. It is a pointless movie with poor acting and no real point. For all of those who enjoyed the film..... I ask "what was there to enjoy"? Apparently I wasn't smoking the same the same thing you were. This movie is about adultery and fornication with a minor. I am also confused about another thing. Supposedly this film is a Drama and a Comedy. I found nothing comedy worthy in the film nor anything that I would consider drama. The film was about the very boring life of a very boring writer, who has very questionable morals. I enjoyed some of the cinematography but the film itself was crap.

    It seems Woody Allen wanted to denounce the pseudo-intellectualism, yet Manhattan is overly arrogant, like its ultra verbose dialogues, based on almost ridiculous, pedant and excluding accumulations of art references. The viewer finds himself enduring this long and boring movie, oozing self-sufficiency, which script boils down to a succession of scenes more boring one from another. The different angles don't work, or with difficulty: it is sometimes funny but it is too sporadic, the drama lacks stakes; only the romance aspect manages not too badly, and still, it is far from excellent. If there was anything to save, it would be the stylish cinematography with some well thought-out shots, but it's just not enough to make Manhattan a good film.

    **1/2 out of **** Probably Woody Allen's most overrated work. I've seen MANHATTAN a few times now and I'll be damned if I'm still not sure what the point of it is. Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, SLEEPER and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not. The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by "middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?).

But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie. Probably the first thing you will notice is that "Manhattan" was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. "Rhapsody in Blue" fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence. This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In "Manhattan" you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, "Gossip is the new pornography." We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say "Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know." That quote might some up the whole movie for you. I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think "Manhattan" is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

Isaac Davis (Allen) is a TV comedy writer who wants to write the great American novel. Despite being 42 and twice divorced he is dating a 17-year-old old girl, Tracey (Mariel Hemingway). His ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep), who left him for another woman, is writing a book about the breakdown of their marriage and after Isaac quits his job he is left cash poor. Despite his relationship with Tracey, Isaac starts to full for another woman, the intelligential but pretentious Mary (Diane Keaton). But she is a woman who is already in a relationship with Isaac's friend, Yale (Michael Murphy). Manhattan is a great looking film with its black and white cinematography highlighting the city, particularly when we get to see the skyline. Combined with Allen's directional approach of long takes and tracking shots gave the film a very classical feel. Allen is very good at letting a conversation flow and letting the actors interact and reaction off each other. Allen assembles an excellent cast who play their roles perfectly. They all worked well together and were very believable, even Hemingway as nice, a little na&iuml;ve teenager who is somehow in a relationship with a man 25 years her senior. Streep role was small but was the professional she always is and Keaton was very different to her role in Annie Hall. When compared to Allen's previous film Annie Hall Manhattan is much more grounded and it is more of a drama then a comedy. There are some funny lines but they are much sparer. But there are some comparisons to Annie Hall, we have similar characters like Yale being a little like Rob in Annie Hall and Allen continues his assault on both mainstream TV comedy and pretentiousness. Like Annie Hall attacks Allen pretentious intelligentialism when talking about art and Allen has a continued love for Ingmar Bergman: but Allen's character is equally as pretentious as Mary yet he gets a free pass. Isaac comes up across as a very selfish and narcissistic character, he only cared about himself and willing to step over other people for his interests. All the characters selfish as they have affairs with each other and want to have the best of both worlds, like Yale who wants Mary whilst stay with his wife. SPOILER: I felt that Isaac's wanting to be with Tracey at the end was a very selfish and basically picked because he just wanted to be with somewhere. Only Tracey comes off in a good light because she has an idealised view of romance and relationships, willing to do anything for Isaac before gaining experience and knowledge from the relationship. I can see why people do like the film but I personally felt it was overrated. Compared to Annie Hall Manhattan lacked heart and passion and felt a much colder film. It is higher to sympathise with the characters in this looser narrative that film has to offer.

    Manhattan-**** (out of 4): Woody Allen broke his strictly comic image with 1977's "Annie Hall" and he followed that effort up with this masterpiece, a work of such beautiful cinematography, pitch-perfect writing, and an unforgettable cast. The opening black and white scenes of Manhattan, set to the pitch of "Rhapsody in Blue" by George Gershwin makes NYC come alive like it never has before. Then, we get to the story, with a group of neurotic New Yorkers struggling to keep their emotional lives in tact. Mariel Hemingway is absolutely fantastic above all the others, she breathes pure sensitivity into her part as Woody's teen-aged lover. "Manhattan" was Allen's first effort to capture the spirit of NYC as a whole and its intellectual community. However, this film functions as more than a love note to New York, it also is a highly personal movie about romance, friendship, and intellectual angst.

    I would say that this review contains a "spoiler" except that would mean the film actually contained a plot. This is on my top ten worst movies list. It is a pointless movie with poor acting and no real point. For all of those who enjoyed the film..... I ask "what was there to enjoy"? Apparently I wasn't smoking the same the same thing you were. This movie is about adultery and fornication with a minor. I am also confused about another thing. Supposedly this film is a Drama and a Comedy. I found nothing comedy worthy in the film nor anything that I would consider drama. The film was about the very boring life of a very boring writer, who has very questionable morals. I enjoyed some of the cinematography but the film itself was crap.

    It seems Woody Allen wanted to denounce the pseudo-intellectualism, yet Manhattan is overly arrogant, like its ultra verbose dialogues, based on almost ridiculous, pedant and excluding accumulations of art references. The viewer finds himself enduring this long and boring movie, oozing self-sufficiency, which script boils down to a succession of scenes more boring one from another. The different angles don't work, or with difficulty: it is sometimes funny but it is too sporadic, the drama lacks stakes; only the romance aspect manages not too badly, and still, it is far from excellent. If there was anything to save, it would be the stylish cinematography with some well thought-out shots, but it's just not enough to make Manhattan a good film.

    **1/2 out of **** Probably Woody Allen's most overrated work. I've seen MANHATTAN a few times now and I'll be damned if I'm still not sure what the point of it is. Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, SLEEPER and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not. The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by "middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?).

    Being only the age of Mariel Hemingway's character in the movie, I've only recently discovered Woody Allen, and after watching and obsessing over Midnight in Paris and (especially) Annie Hall, I thought I should check out some of Allen's other films. I wanted to start with Sweet and Lowdown (because that's my favorite Gershwin piece and it sounded kind of awesome), which seems to be one of his lesser-known movies, but it wasn't on instant Netflix so I turned to Manhattan. It's set to a strictly Gershwin soundtrack, it's a post-Technicolor black and white film, and it reunites Woody Allen and Diane Keaton- what more could I ask for? As it turns out, a lot. Watching this film was very much, for me, like visiting New York City for the first time. I had heard about New York from Frank Sinatra, seen it in Breakfast at Tiffany's, walked its streets with Holden Caulfield, but when I stepped foot in Manhattan for the first time, I wasn't in Manhattan at all. I was in a dingy city lit up by too many wasted watts of electricity, a city with too many McDonalds and not enough trees. A woman actually blew cigarette smoke in my face and everything! I wasn't in New York City at all, because New York City doesn't really exist, except for in Woody Allen movies and those sorts of things. And so it goes with Manhattan. Here it was, inarguably Allen's magnum opus, his love letter to dear New York City, a guest at the Oscars- but it wasn't. I was hoping for the witty writing, the stand-up comedian sort of humor I had come to expect after watching Annie Hall, but it all seemed very old hat to me, like a watered-down version of Woody Allen movie. I don't mean to sound awful, but I can't help but wonder if he wrote the script just so he could film romantic scenes with someone twenty years younger than himself. And God was it pretentious. It was so pretentious. I'm all for allusions to art or literature or what have you ("your self-confidence is a notch below Kafka's"- that line- sorry if it isn't verbatim- did make me laugh), but nobody in real life goes on about van Gogh (gah?) and all the way Keaton's character did. Well, maybe people in New York City do.

    This movie will always have a special place in my heart. I will always remember this as the movie that made me want to become a filmmaker myself. But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie. Probably the first thing you will notice is that "Manhattan" was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. "Rhapsody in Blue" fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence. This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In "Manhattan" you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, "Gossip is the new pornography." We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say "Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know." That quote might some up the whole movie for you. I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think "Manhattan" is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

    Ironically a film that is arguably his greatest achievements as a director is also a film that woody Allen so adamantly detested and tried to prevent from being release. But thank god for me, and for the rest of humanity, that it never happened, because for me it's the greatest film I have ever seen, combination of beautiful soundtracks, amazing cinematography and great writing. Almost modern day reimagining of one of Shakespeare's plays titled Midnight Summers Night Dream. Similarities lay in the premise where people who are currently with in a relationship, but still yearning to be with somebody else. One relationship in particular is between 42 year old, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) and 17 year old Mariel Hemingway  she was nominated for both an Oscar and a BAFTA for her performance. But as the film progresses Isaac, begins to grow disillusioned with his relationship with Tracey, which coincides with his growing attraction to the girl his best-friends is cheating on his wife with Diane Keaton  you seeing the Midnight Summers Night Dream link yet? But this isn't the first time Keaton and Allen have been on screen together, this dream team have teamed up on 5 occasions, of most merit is a film Allen wrote and directed, Annie Hall - Seen by most as the second greatest romance film in history, after Casablanca. For a film shot in black and white it is absolutely brimming with colour, such are the powerful yet elegant anaesthetics, combined with dysfunctional yet, very real and relatable characters, Woody Allen masterminds a visceral piece of film literature.

    It is a brilliant film, one of the best films from a brilliant writer, producer, director and actor Woody Allen! It is witty and comic, a simple story of simple people in new york, don't be put off by the fact it was filmed in black and white, the effect of it is brilliant! A Real Must See!I thurely enjoyed this film and think on IMDb it is underrated, in fact i think this film is underrated almost everywhere, don't believe what you here from other people, newspapers and critics almost always fail to see a brilliant film even if it is thrust in front of their face, they are nit picky and never give a film all its deserved credit! I also enjoyed many other films by Woody Allen, films like 'the purple rose of Cairo' and 'midnight in Paris' are very good films to watch.

    Woody Allen's Manhattan is proof that the smallest things do in fact make a film great, even when they're put to use in a projects that seems as if it could do no wrong. To put it simply, this is a glorious film, that utilizes character development, poignancy, deep thought, personal flaws, and love to tell a story that is one for the history books of cinema. The film focuses on forty-two year old, comedy writer Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) who is going out with seventeen year old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Tracy views their relationship as a precocious one that is directly built off of love. Isaac views it as a passing diversion that will soon be forgotten by the both of them. Isaac feels as if he is the last thinking man in a world that is made up of a cesspool of idiots and pseudo-intellectual mouthbreathers. He winds up meeting Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), who rubs him the wrong way at first, but eventually begins to grow on him for her the intelligence she provides and the waves of passion that seemingly flow off her body. Isaac still continues his relationship with Tracy, even though, at this point, why bother? He personally believes it will go nowhere. Tracy clings to hope that it will go somewhere and frets over the idea it won't and, in the end, feels as if she will soon be facing a dark inevitability of life. The only thing seemingly stopping Isaac from going all the way with Mary is that she is currently dating his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) is dating her. But, then again, it doesn't stop him so much to become romantically invested with her, spending all the time in the world and even having sex; so what is exactly stopping him. This is when Manhattan becomes one of the most involved pictures Allen has ever made. Nothing is truly stopping Isaac, but he is paranoid over small details and sees most everything as either trivial (his relationship with Tracy) or effectively makes it achieve a level of intimacy and success that cannot be passed (his relationship with Mary). Isaac wants his relationship with Mary to pass unfathomable heights that may not exist in reality, and his attachment to Tracy is one out of pure convenience. He is in dire need of a wake up call. Not many filmmakers could portray a relationship between a forty-year-old and a teenager to such great power and believability, and with Woody Allen's reputation as of now, one entering this picture blindly could base the premise too much on reality. The fact is he does a brilliant job taking a controversial subject into light. The scene at the diner between Isaac and Tracy, among many other things, is terrific and captivating and accentuates truly what Allen is about in making deeply involved human dramas. Combine the plot and character elements of the film with amazing black and white photography by Gordon Willis and an amazingly elegant score by George Gershwin and you have a picture that delights on every level for your senses. It's extremely rare a film hit many areas of a film on the head with such confidence and style, but Woody Allen's Manhattan does it and does it boldly, making this one of the best romantic films I have yet to see. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, and Michael Murphy. Directed by: Woody Allen.

Isaac Davis (Allen) is a TV comedy writer who wants to write the great American novel. Despite being 42 and twice divorced he is dating a 17-year-old old girl, Tracey (Mariel Hemingway). His ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep), who left him for another woman, is writing a book about the breakdown of their marriage and after Isaac quits his job he is left cash poor.

    **1/2 out of **** Probably Woody Allen's most overrated work. I've seen MANHATTAN a few times now and I'll be damned if I'm still not sure what the point of it is. Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, SLEEPER and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not. The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by "middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?).

    This movie will always have a special place in my heart. I will always remember this as the movie that made me want to become a filmmaker myself. But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie. Probably the first thing you will notice is that "Manhattan" was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. "Rhapsody in Blue" fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence. This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In "Manhattan" you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, "Gossip is the new pornography." We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say "Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know." That quote might some up the whole movie for you. I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think "Manhattan" is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

    Ironically a film that is arguably his greatest achievements as a director is also a film that woody Allen so adamantly detested and tried to prevent from being release. But thank god for me, and for the rest of humanity, that it never happened, because for me it's the greatest film I have ever seen, combination of beautiful soundtracks, amazing cinematography and great writing. Almost modern day reimagining of one of Shakespeare's plays titled Midnight Summers Night Dream. Similarities lay in the premise where people who are currently with in a relationship, but still yearning to be with somebody else. One relationship in particular is between 42 year old, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) and 17 year old Mariel Hemingway  she was nominated for both an Oscar and a BAFTA for her performance. But as the film progresses Isaac, begins to grow disillusioned with his relationship with Tracey, which coincides with his growing attraction to the girl his best-friends is cheating on his wife with Diane Keaton  you seeing the Midnight Summers Night Dream link yet? But this isn't the first time Keaton and Allen have been on screen together, this dream team have teamed up on 5 occasions, of most merit is a film Allen wrote and directed, Annie Hall - Seen by most as the second greatest romance film in history, after Casablanca. For a film shot in black and white it is absolutely brimming with colour, such are the powerful yet elegant anaesthetics, combined with dysfunctional yet, very real and relatable characters, Woody Allen masterminds a visceral piece of film literature.

    It is a brilliant film, one of the best films from a brilliant writer, producer, director and actor Woody Allen! It is witty and comic, a simple story of simple people in new york, don't be put off by the fact it was filmed in black and white, the effect of it is brilliant! A Real Must See!I thurely enjoyed this film and think on IMDb it is underrated, in fact i think this film is underrated almost everywhere, don't believe what you here from other people, newspapers and critics almost always fail to see a brilliant film even if it is thrust in front of their face, they are nit picky and never give a film all its deserved credit! I also enjoyed many other films by Woody Allen, films like 'the purple rose of Cairo' and 'midnight in Paris' are very good films to watch.

    Woody Allen's Manhattan is proof that the smallest things do in fact make a film great, even when they're put to use in a projects that seems as if it could do no wrong. To put it simply, this is a glorious film, that utilizes character development, poignancy, deep thought, personal flaws, and love to tell a story that is one for the history books of cinema. The film focuses on forty-two year old, comedy writer Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) who is going out with seventeen year old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Tracy views their relationship as a precocious one that is directly built off of love. Isaac views it as a passing diversion that will soon be forgotten by the both of them. Isaac feels as if he is the last thinking man in a world that is made up of a cesspool of idiots and pseudo-intellectual mouthbreathers. He winds up meeting Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), who rubs him the wrong way at first, but eventually begins to grow on him for her the intelligence she provides and the waves of passion that seemingly flow off her body. Isaac still continues his relationship with Tracy, even though, at this point, why bother? He personally believes it will go nowhere. Tracy clings to hope that it will go somewhere and frets over the idea it won't and, in the end, feels as if she will soon be facing a dark inevitability of life. The only thing seemingly stopping Isaac from going all the way with Mary is that she is currently dating his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) is dating her. But, then again, it doesn't stop him so much to become romantically invested with her, spending all the time in the world and even having sex; so what is exactly stopping him. This is when Manhattan becomes one of the most involved pictures Allen has ever made. Nothing is truly stopping Isaac, but he is paranoid over small details and sees most everything as either trivial (his relationship with Tracy) or effectively makes it achieve a level of intimacy and success that cannot be passed (his relationship with Mary). Isaac wants his relationship with Mary to pass unfathomable heights that may not exist in reality, and his attachment to Tracy is one out of pure convenience. He is in dire need of a wake up call. Not many filmmakers could portray a relationship between a forty-year-old and a teenager to such great power and believability, and with Woody Allen's reputation as of now, one entering this picture blindly could base the premise too much on reality. The fact is he does a brilliant job taking a controversial subject into light. The scene at the diner between Isaac and Tracy, among many other things, is terrific and captivating and accentuates truly what Allen is about in making deeply involved human dramas. Combine the plot and character elements of the film with amazing black and white photography by Gordon Willis and an amazingly elegant score by George Gershwin and you have a picture that delights on every level for your senses. It's extremely rare a film hit many areas of a film on the head with such confidence and style, but Woody Allen's Manhattan does it and does it boldly, making this one of the best romantic films I have yet to see. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, and Michael Murphy. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    Manhattan is often considered Woody Allen's magnum opus, his great work that has been praised by critics and audiences alike, earning Oscars and a place on the IMDb Top 250 list. Isaac Davis (Allen) is a TV comedy writer who wants to write the great American novel. Despite being 42 and twice divorced he is dating a 17-year-old old girl, Tracey (Mariel Hemingway). His ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep), who left him for another woman, is writing a book about the breakdown of their marriage and after Isaac quits his job he is left cash poor. Despite his relationship with Tracey, Isaac starts to full for another woman, the intelligential but pretentious Mary (Diane Keaton). But she is a woman who is already in a relationship with Isaac's friend, Yale (Michael Murphy). Manhattan is a great looking film with its black and white cinematography highlighting the city, particularly when we get to see the skyline. Combined with Allen's directional approach of long takes and tracking shots gave the film a very classical feel. Allen is very good at letting a conversation flow and letting the actors interact and reaction off each other. Allen assembles an excellent cast who play their roles perfectly. They all worked well together and were very believable, even Hemingway as nice, a little na&iuml;ve teenager who is somehow in a relationship with a man 25 years her senior. Streep role was small but was the professional she always is and Keaton was very different to her role in Annie Hall. When compared to Allen's previous film Annie Hall Manhattan is much more grounded and it is more of a drama then a comedy. There are some funny lines but they are much sparer. But there are some comparisons to Annie Hall, we have similar characters like Yale being a little like Rob in Annie Hall and Allen continues his assault on both mainstream TV comedy and pretentiousness. Like Annie Hall attacks Allen pretentious intelligentialism when talking about art and Allen has a continued love for Ingmar Bergman: but Allen's character is equally as pretentious as Mary yet he gets a free pass. Isaac comes up across as a very selfish and narcissistic character, he only cared about himself and willing to step over other people for his interests. All the characters selfish as they have affairs with each other and want to have the best of both worlds, like Yale who wants Mary whilst stay with his wife. SPOILER: I felt that Isaac's wanting to be with Tracey at the end was a very selfish and basically picked because he just wanted to be with somewhere. Only Tracey comes off in a good light because she has an idealised view of romance and relationships, willing to do anything for Isaac before gaining experience and knowledge from the relationship. I can see why people do like the film but I personally felt it was overrated. Compared to Annie Hall Manhattan lacked heart and passion and felt a much colder film. It is higher to sympathise with the characters in this looser narrative that film has to offer.

    Manhattan-**** (out of 4): Woody Allen broke his strictly comic image with 1977's "Annie Hall" and he followed that effort up with this masterpiece, a work of such beautiful cinematography, pitch-perfect writing, and an unforgettable cast. The opening black and white scenes of Manhattan, set to the pitch of "Rhapsody in Blue" by George Gershwin makes NYC come alive like it never has before. Then, we get to the story, with a group of neurotic New Yorkers struggling to keep their emotional lives in tact. Mariel Hemingway is absolutely fantastic above all the others, she breathes pure sensitivity into her part as Woody's teen-aged lover. "Manhattan" was Allen's first effort to capture the spirit of NYC as a whole and its intellectual community. However, this film functions as more than a love note to New York, it also is a highly personal movie about romance, friendship, and intellectual angst.

    I would say that this review contains a "spoiler" except that would mean the film actually contained a plot. This is on my top ten worst movies list. It is a pointless movie with poor acting and no real point. For all of those who enjoyed the film..... I ask "what was there to enjoy"? Apparently I wasn't smoking the same the same thing you were. This movie is about adultery and fornication with a minor. I am also confused about another thing. Supposedly this film is a Drama and a Comedy. I found nothing comedy worthy in the film nor anything that I would consider drama. The film was about the very boring life of a very boring writer, who has very questionable morals. I enjoyed some of the cinematography but the film itself was crap.

    It seems Woody Allen wanted to denounce the pseudo-intellectualism, yet Manhattan is overly arrogant, like its ultra verbose dialogues, based on almost ridiculous, pedant and excluding accumulations of art references. The viewer finds himself enduring this long and boring movie, oozing self-sufficiency, which script boils down to a succession of scenes more boring one from another. The different angles don't work, or with difficulty: it is sometimes funny but it is too sporadic, the drama lacks stakes; only the romance aspect manages not too badly, and still, it is far from excellent. If there was anything to save, it would be the stylish cinematography with some well thought-out shots, but it's just not enough to make Manhattan a good film.

    **1/2 out of **** Probably Woody Allen's most overrated work. I've seen MANHATTAN a few times now and I'll be damned if I'm still not sure what the point of it is. Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, SLEEPER and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not. The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by "middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?).

    Being only the age of Mariel Hemingway's character in the movie, I've only recently discovered Woody Allen, and after watching and obsessing over Midnight in Paris and (especially) Annie Hall, I thought I should check out some of Allen's other films. I wanted to start with Sweet and Lowdown (because that's my favorite Gershwin piece and it sounded kind of awesome), which seems to be one of his lesser-known movies, but it wasn't on instant Netflix so I turned to Manhattan. It's set to a strictly Gershwin soundtrack, it's a post-Technicolor black and white film, and it reunites Woody Allen and Diane Keaton- what more could I ask for? As it turns out, a lot. Watching this film was very much, for me, like visiting New York City for the first time. I had heard about New York from Frank Sinatra, seen it in Breakfast at Tiffany's, walked its streets with Holden Caulfield, but when I stepped foot in Manhattan for the first time, I wasn't in Manhattan at all. I was in a dingy city lit up by too many wasted watts of electricity, a city with too many McDonalds and not enough trees. A woman actually blew cigarette smoke in my face and everything! I wasn't in New York City at all, because New York City doesn't really exist, except for in Woody Allen movies and those sorts of things. And so it goes with Manhattan. Here it was, inarguably Allen's magnum opus, his love letter to dear New York City, a guest at the Oscars- but it wasn't. I was hoping for the witty writing, the stand-up comedian sort of humor I had come to expect after watching Annie Hall, but it all seemed very old hat to me, like a watered-down version of Woody Allen movie. I don't mean to sound awful, but I can't help but wonder if he wrote the script just so he could film romantic scenes with someone twenty years younger than himself. And God was it pretentious. It was so pretentious. I'm all for allusions to art or literature or what have you ("your self-confidence is a notch below Kafka's"- that line- sorry if it isn't verbatim- did make me laugh), but nobody in real life goes on about van Gogh (gah?) and all the way Keaton's character did. Well, maybe people in New York City do.

    This movie will always have a special place in my heart. I will always remember this as the movie that made me want to become a filmmaker myself. But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie. Probably the first thing you will notice is that "Manhattan" was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. "Rhapsody in Blue" fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence. This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In "Manhattan" you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, "Gossip is the new pornography." We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say "Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know." That quote might some up the whole movie for you. I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think "Manhattan" is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

If there was anything to save, it would be the stylish cinematography with some well thought-out shots, but it's just not enough to make Manhattan a good film.

    **1/2 out of **** Probably Woody Allen's most overrated work. I've seen MANHATTAN a few times now and I'll be damned if I'm still not sure what the point of it is. Allen followed his acclaimed ANNIE HALL with this, his plush black and white stylized tribute to New York City and director Ingmar Bergman, but it's not as good and doesn't offer much for the viewer other than the glitz. Allen plays a middle-aged writer of 42 named Isaac, who is divorced from his ex-wife (Meryl Streep - who is now living with another woman in a lesbian relationship), and now dates and sleeps with a 17 year-old high school student (the emotionless Mariel Hemingway). But he gets his head turned when he meets Diane Keaton again, which is becoming more than a little redundant after PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM, SLEEPER and ANNIE HALL. Diane is involved in an affair with a married friend of Woody's, a guy who isn't sure whether to risk his marriage or not. The artsy gray backdrop of New York is really at the heart of the film, but the conflicting relationships themselves here don't really go anywhere. The only point I can surmise from all of this is that romance can be complicated and partners will tend to play musical chairs and use each other if need be, just out of to keep from being alone. Nowhere is this clearer than at the self-centered conclusion of MANHATTAN, which coughs up one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings of all time. (One comment for the many people who are so repulsed by "middle-aged Isaac dating the 17-aged student": just relax -- in the movie, Woody exclaims that she's nearly 18... so what, do people think that in just a few weeks the girl's suddenly mature enough overnight?).

    Being only the age of Mariel Hemingway's character in the movie, I've only recently discovered Woody Allen, and after watching and obsessing over Midnight in Paris and (especially) Annie Hall, I thought I should check out some of Allen's other films. I wanted to start with Sweet and Lowdown (because that's my favorite Gershwin piece and it sounded kind of awesome), which seems to be one of his lesser-known movies, but it wasn't on instant Netflix so I turned to Manhattan. It's set to a strictly Gershwin soundtrack, it's a post-Technicolor black and white film, and it reunites Woody Allen and Diane Keaton- what more could I ask for? As it turns out, a lot. Watching this film was very much, for me, like visiting New York City for the first time. I had heard about New York from Frank Sinatra, seen it in Breakfast at Tiffany's, walked its streets with Holden Caulfield, but when I stepped foot in Manhattan for the first time, I wasn't in Manhattan at all. I was in a dingy city lit up by too many wasted watts of electricity, a city with too many McDonalds and not enough trees. A woman actually blew cigarette smoke in my face and everything! I wasn't in New York City at all, because New York City doesn't really exist, except for in Woody Allen movies and those sorts of things. And so it goes with Manhattan. Here it was, inarguably Allen's magnum opus, his love letter to dear New York City, a guest at the Oscars- but it wasn't. I was hoping for the witty writing, the stand-up comedian sort of humor I had come to expect after watching Annie Hall, but it all seemed very old hat to me, like a watered-down version of Woody Allen movie. I don't mean to sound awful, but I can't help but wonder if he wrote the script just so he could film romantic scenes with someone twenty years younger than himself. And God was it pretentious. It was so pretentious. I'm all for allusions to art or literature or what have you ("your self-confidence is a notch below Kafka's"- that line- sorry if it isn't verbatim- did make me laugh), but nobody in real life goes on about van Gogh (gah?) and all the way Keaton's character did. Well, maybe people in New York City do.
