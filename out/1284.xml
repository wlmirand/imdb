    It's amazing to read the reviews on these pages, how everyone has an opinion about films and especially a film that tries to be as close to real life as possible. Some find it a relevant character study, others are hung up on the plot holes. To be more precise, a gaping plot hole as the mystery of this plot is finally unfolded. To get in my point, this is a movie. It's not the best movie ever made, to me it doesn't really represent reality and there are plot holes, but I simply don't care. I am more interested if a movie can involve me or even change me in some way. Sad to say, this does not fall under that category. I am a great fan of both Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep. I will go as far as to say that Meryl Streep can play just about everything. But in playing a part that you perhaps invest a little too much of yourself in, you fall victim to either trying too hard not to show that you're acting or trying to overact. For this film, I wish the actors were a little more willing to overact. That would have made this a lot more enjoyable. Everything, from the characters reactions to the machinations of the plot seem overly calculated. There is not a big moment of release, as is normally usual in these types of film. Liam Neeson seems at first to be a buffoon in what he does to protect his son, but then we get reasoning, that what he did, is exactly what you should do in cases like these. A little too much of a coincidence, don't you think? As for Edward Furlong, he looks so tiny. It is actually brilliant casting because never in a million years, would you consider him a threat to anything. Liam Neeson looks like he could squash him with his thumb. Meryl Streep could probably kill him with one slap. There should not be made some significance about a movie like this. Don't dare call it reality. It is at least a distorted reality. Character study? They do a better job on something like any drama series you can think of.

    I read half of the reviews and boy, is there a difference of opinion. Some people feel the actors and plot suck, others are impressed with both. Put me in the latter category. Julia Weldon as the daughter who is wise beyond her years (hard to believe she's now in her 40s) is both appealing and convincing. As for Furlong, he was as tense and intense as the part demanded. One critic griped about him being so short compared to Neeson. Remember Michael Gross and Michael J. Fox? Those were really mixed genes. I could not put down Streep, one of today's strongest actresses. I felt she was as good as usual - meaning better than most; I always enjoy Neeson and am usually convinced that he is who he says he is. Some folks complained about plot holes. There were some loose ends, but they didn't bother me. That is the way this particular scenario played out. All in all, it kept me engrossed and, yes, I would recommend it - both 'Before' and 'After.'

    I'm probably repeating some of the issues already put forward concerning this film. The father in this movie is an utter ass. He acts only in his own self interest. If such a creep exists, we can see why the kid is a bit messed up. The plot follows the discovery of a young girl's body and a link to a young man (the son) who is connected to her. Once the father, played by Liam Neeson, goes bananas and starts destroying evidence, the die is cast. Meryl Streep's doctor/mother tries to look at things in a sane way, but she is constantly overpowered by her brutish husband. She is a realist and knows what needs to be done. The father makes it so much worse than it could have been that options are really limited. Also, Alfred Molina's lawyer role is so full of it. He chomps on a sandwich while talking about the most serious issue in the world. This is supposed to fill us with confidence (he may be eccentric but I'll bet he's really good). The script and the formulation of the events in this film, not to mention much of the acting just doesn't cut it very well.

    If you've read to this point in the reviews then I suppose you will not be distressed by spoilers, but be on the alert. I discuss the ending. Spoilers coming. This movie is about a family in crisis and I found it quite involving overall. It also raises ponder-worthy questions about personal and legal ethics. I was afraid it would end in typical Hollywood style with the kid getting off scotfree. But telling the truth doesn't give him a pass; he must suffer the consequences of his actions. Of course the aggressive gotta-win attorney thinks his clients have acted in their own worst interests. But have they? Father and son do some prison time and then, the film suggests, the family heals and each member of it can move forward with a clear conscience. I agree with some of the complaints aired here by others but not all. I thought the production values were fine. It's a cold movie, a twilight and night movie, and the murky snow-filled landscapes and shadowy interiors seemed perfect. I don't see how anyone can complain about Meryl Streep's performance, which is understated and nuanced. Neeson's character is fierce; it's gotta be played fiercely and Neeson comports himself well. The son and daughter were not as effective; these young actors lack vocal power and fail to put across any subtext.

    It's hard to understand why some movies ever got made. Who ever green-lighted this unconvincing and formulaic story to be filmed? And even bigger question, why did all of these great and established names committed themselves to this project? Thing with this movie its story is that it never reaches a level above average. No shocking surprises or twists, no real convincing emotions, no tension. It feels just like a very empty and distant movie. The story unfolds itself as a very unconvincing one, since some very unlikely things start to happen in the movie. I just never understood the fact why the parents weren't desperate to get the truth from their son. They just eat together as an happy family, when the son is being nothing but death silent about the whole situation. This would had ticked me off as a parent and would had driven me insane. Just imaging your son being the main suspect in a murder case but he doesn't say anything to you about what happened. I would feel so mad at him and terribly unsure but not Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep. Also the way how the entire suddenly seemed to be against the family seemed so incredibly forced and silly that it all became incredibly unconvincing. The movie doesn't make you sympathize enough for any of its characters or with its drama. It would had perhaps also helped if the boy was really innocent and had nothing to do with the death of the young girl at all. Yes, there definitely are far worse movies out there but that doesn't make this movie a good one. Even though the movie never gets above the level of average it also never goes below the level of horrible. It's just a very average movie, by the numbers. Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson, Alfred Molina, Edward Furlong and John Heard are all actors that appear in this movie and it really makes you wonder why. I just can't imaging after reading the script that they seriously thought this would make a great, powerful and effective movie, that would leave a lasting impression on people and could even sweep some awards. All actors make some mistake in their careers and this movie seems to be one for all of them. Also some actors just get terrible underused in this movie. What was the point of the John Heard character? And why is Alfred Molina role so small in this. His role seemed like it could had played a far more important one for the movie. It could at least had given the story some more depth with its entire court proceedings. Not an horrible movie but I just can't think of any reasons why you should ever watch it. 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I had put off watching it for a long time because I thought it would fall on standard clich&eacute;s in the telling of its murder mystery. But there's a lot to like here. For starters, the performances by the lead actors are first rate. Streep and Neeson come across as real people tackling a real problem. I should also add that Alfred Molina also gives a solid performance as the defense attorney. (Though the fact he looks like idiot movie critic Michael Medved gave me a few chuckles at times.) The script gives most of its characters a fair shake. The parents are sympathetic at times, but sometimes they make decisions we disapprove of. The townspeople and police are not one-note characters, showing off more than one side. The movie unfolds at a pace that keeps us interested and informed. It's directed with an appropriate bleak look that suits the subject matter. There is one flaw with the movie, however. I thought that Edward Furlong's character was repulsive, stupid, and hateful. I don't blame Furlong for this, but his direction and his parts of the screenplay. I think a better way the movie could have gone would be to give him a mixed view, neither overly sympathetic or hateful. This would make the viewer think long and hard about him, and wonder if his fate at the end of the movie is correct or not.

    This film is very plausible as it revolves around teenagers from families rich and average, how the average people see the rich one as money buying everything and the average ones disapprove of it; when in fact there are some rich families which don't think that way as seen in this film. This film is very feasible as it looks on behalf of one's personal development and how one focuses on how they suffered in a tragic process, the price we pay, focusing on life's lessons and every person and family has problems. It also shows how one deals with a problem in such a difficult situation and we see what happened then, and what has happened to us now. Watch the common plausible and feasible ways of life between the rich and average communities and people.

    How you could take Meryl Streep, Liam Nelson and Alfred Molina and only produce a half baked turkey like this is beyond me. But they did. The plot, as serpentine as it was, could have made sense. But it plays against human nature a good part of the time. Or maybe it was just the dialogue that wasn't human. I plugged along with this tired play only to see how it ended. It did. The idea that a 16 year old could get himself into so much trouble is not unbelievable. And after killing someone, even accidentally, one would probably become panic stricken. But I think it's human nature to try and hide the crime, not just leave all the clues and drive your family car home with blood in the trunk, including the mysterious bloody glove (where did that come from?) As for the father, he should stick with art. By trying to hide what he assumes is his son's crime, he only makes it worse. Meryl is a mother and she plays that part well. In fact she is the only believable character. Julia Weldon must be well connected because she can't act and that was a major drawback. The dichotomy of whether one should support family at all costs or seek the truth for all involved ( for the sake of society) is not new. As an artist, if he were from Bulgaria or some such country, Nelson's character might seem more believable. Everything is corrupt there. But here, we still assume that the innocent may get a fair shake, in spite of 6 years of the current regime's attempts to take away all rights of anyone they don't like. Never been a big fan of Furlong and his whining seems to be nearly continual in anything he does. Is there a casting call for whiners? There was a kernel of an idea in this movie, but without the proper care, it just became nutty.

    Director Barbet Schroeder's curiously artificial drama, adapted from Rosellen Brown's book, concerns teenager Edward Furlong, a boy from a stable home, standing accused of killing his girlfriend in a snowy New England town. The family dynamics (with Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson as Furlong's parents) seem strangely off-kilter in a picture that depends on a realistic familial unit (it just doesn't come off, despite the talent involved). The film's editing is tight, while the cinematography and vividly-drawn flashbacks lend a much-needed sinister air to the proceedings. Unfortunately, Schroeder's direction overall is pitched far too high, as is Neeson's unsuccessful performance. A mildly intriguing near-miss. ** from ****

    At least MERYL STREEP is not required to don an accent for her role as a New England housewife whose son accidentally kills his girl friend during an argument--and the father, who deeply loves the boy, tries to cover up the crime by hiding the evidence. That's about the thrust of the plot--and the rest of the film has these three coping with the moral problems involved in not telling the whole truth to the lawyer assigned to defend the boy. Streep gives one of her more natural performances, as does LIAM NEESON as the upset father who needs some anger management. ED FURLONG is excellent as their sensitive, brooding son who realizes he can't go on lying about the whole matter, regardless of consequences. Well done and steers away from becoming the overwrought, overwhelmingly melodramatic film this would have been if it were made into a Joan Crawford film in the 1940s, with Joan protecting her child at all costs. The pace is too slow, but it's worth viewing if only to see Streep, Neeson and Furlong in excellent performances.

In fact she is the only believable character. Julia Weldon must be well connected because she can't act and that was a major drawback. The dichotomy of whether one should support family at all costs or seek the truth for all involved ( for the sake of society) is not new. As an artist, if he were from Bulgaria or some such country, Nelson's character might seem more believable. Everything is corrupt there. But here, we still assume that the innocent may get a fair shake, in spite of 6 years of the current regime's attempts to take away all rights of anyone they don't like. Never been a big fan of Furlong and his whining seems to be nearly continual in anything he does. Is there a casting call for whiners? There was a kernel of an idea in this movie, but without the proper care, it just became nutty.

    Director Barbet Schroeder's curiously artificial drama, adapted from Rosellen Brown's book, concerns teenager Edward Furlong, a boy from a stable home, standing accused of killing his girlfriend in a snowy New England town. The family dynamics (with Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson as Furlong's parents) seem strangely off-kilter in a picture that depends on a realistic familial unit (it just doesn't come off, despite the talent involved). The film's editing is tight, while the cinematography and vividly-drawn flashbacks lend a much-needed sinister air to the proceedings. Unfortunately, Schroeder's direction overall is pitched far too high, as is Neeson's unsuccessful performance. A mildly intriguing near-miss. ** from ****

    At least MERYL STREEP is not required to don an accent for her role as a New England housewife whose son accidentally kills his girl friend during an argument--and the father, who deeply loves the boy, tries to cover up the crime by hiding the evidence. That's about the thrust of the plot--and the rest of the film has these three coping with the moral problems involved in not telling the whole truth to the lawyer assigned to defend the boy. Streep gives one of her more natural performances, as does LIAM NEESON as the upset father who needs some anger management. ED FURLONG is excellent as their sensitive, brooding son who realizes he can't go on lying about the whole matter, regardless of consequences. Well done and steers away from becoming the overwrought, overwhelmingly melodramatic film this would have been if it were made into a Joan Crawford film in the 1940s, with Joan protecting her child at all costs. The pace is too slow, but it's worth viewing if only to see Streep, Neeson and Furlong in excellent performances.

    It's amazing to read the reviews on these pages, how everyone has an opinion about films and especially a film that tries to be as close to real life as possible. Some find it a relevant character study, others are hung up on the plot holes. To be more precise, a gaping plot hole as the mystery of this plot is finally unfolded. To get in my point, this is a movie. It's not the best movie ever made, to me it doesn't really represent reality and there are plot holes, but I simply don't care. I am more interested if a movie can involve me or even change me in some way. Sad to say, this does not fall under that category. I am a great fan of both Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep. I will go as far as to say that Meryl Streep can play just about everything. But in playing a part that you perhaps invest a little too much of yourself in, you fall victim to either trying too hard not to show that you're acting or trying to overact. For this film, I wish the actors were a little more willing to overact. That would have made this a lot more enjoyable. Everything, from the characters reactions to the machinations of the plot seem overly calculated. There is not a big moment of release, as is normally usual in these types of film. Liam Neeson seems at first to be a buffoon in what he does to protect his son, but then we get reasoning, that what he did, is exactly what you should do in cases like these. A little too much of a coincidence, don't you think? As for Edward Furlong, he looks so tiny. It is actually brilliant casting because never in a million years, would you consider him a threat to anything. Liam Neeson looks like he could squash him with his thumb. Meryl Streep could probably kill him with one slap. There should not be made some significance about a movie like this. Don't dare call it reality. It is at least a distorted reality. Character study? They do a better job on something like any drama series you can think of.

    I read half of the reviews and boy, is there a difference of opinion. Some people feel the actors and plot suck, others are impressed with both. Put me in the latter category. Julia Weldon as the daughter who is wise beyond her years (hard to believe she's now in her 40s) is both appealing and convincing. As for Furlong, he was as tense and intense as the part demanded. One critic griped about him being so short compared to Neeson. Remember Michael Gross and Michael J. Fox? Those were really mixed genes. I could not put down Streep, one of today's strongest actresses. I felt she was as good as usual - meaning better than most; I always enjoy Neeson and am usually convinced that he is who he says he is. Some folks complained about plot holes. There were some loose ends, but they didn't bother me. That is the way this particular scenario played out. All in all, it kept me engrossed and, yes, I would recommend it - both 'Before' and 'After.'

    I'm probably repeating some of the issues already put forward concerning this film. The father in this movie is an utter ass. He acts only in his own self interest. If such a creep exists, we can see why the kid is a bit messed up. The plot follows the discovery of a young girl's body and a link to a young man (the son) who is connected to her. Once the father, played by Liam Neeson, goes bananas and starts destroying evidence, the die is cast. Meryl Streep's doctor/mother tries to look at things in a sane way, but she is constantly overpowered by her brutish husband. She is a realist and knows what needs to be done. The father makes it so much worse than it could have been that options are really limited. Also, Alfred Molina's lawyer role is so full of it. He chomps on a sandwich while talking about the most serious issue in the world. This is supposed to fill us with confidence (he may be eccentric but I'll bet he's really good). The script and the formulation of the events in this film, not to mention much of the acting just doesn't cut it very well.

    If you've read to this point in the reviews then I suppose you will not be distressed by spoilers, but be on the alert. I discuss the ending. Spoilers coming. This movie is about a family in crisis and I found it quite involving overall. It also raises ponder-worthy questions about personal and legal ethics. I was afraid it would end in typical Hollywood style with the kid getting off scotfree. But telling the truth doesn't give him a pass; he must suffer the consequences of his actions. Of course the aggressive gotta-win attorney thinks his clients have acted in their own worst interests. But have they? Father and son do some prison time and then, the film suggests, the family heals and each member of it can move forward with a clear conscience. I agree with some of the complaints aired here by others but not all. I thought the production values were fine. It's a cold movie, a twilight and night movie, and the murky snow-filled landscapes and shadowy interiors seemed perfect. I don't see how anyone can complain about Meryl Streep's performance, which is understated and nuanced. Neeson's character is fierce; it's gotta be played fiercely and Neeson comports himself well. The son and daughter were not as effective; these young actors lack vocal power and fail to put across any subtext.

    It's hard to understand why some movies ever got made. Who ever green-lighted this unconvincing and formulaic story to be filmed? And even bigger question, why did all of these great and established names committed themselves to this project? Thing with this movie its story is that it never reaches a level above average. No shocking surprises or twists, no real convincing emotions, no tension. It feels just like a very empty and distant movie. The story unfolds itself as a very unconvincing one, since some very unlikely things start to happen in the movie. I just never understood the fact why the parents weren't desperate to get the truth from their son. They just eat together as an happy family, when the son is being nothing but death silent about the whole situation. This would had ticked me off as a parent and would had driven me insane. Just imaging your son being the main suspect in a murder case but he doesn't say anything to you about what happened. I would feel so mad at him and terribly unsure but not Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep. Also the way how the entire suddenly seemed to be against the family seemed so incredibly forced and silly that it all became incredibly unconvincing. The movie doesn't make you sympathize enough for any of its characters or with its drama. It would had perhaps also helped if the boy was really innocent and had nothing to do with the death of the young girl at all. Yes, there definitely are far worse movies out there but that doesn't make this movie a good one. Even though the movie never gets above the level of average it also never goes below the level of horrible. It's just a very average movie, by the numbers. Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson, Alfred Molina, Edward Furlong and John Heard are all actors that appear in this movie and it really makes you wonder why. I just can't imaging after reading the script that they seriously thought this would make a great, powerful and effective movie, that would leave a lasting impression on people and could even sweep some awards. All actors make some mistake in their careers and this movie seems to be one for all of them. Also some actors just get terrible underused in this movie. What was the point of the John Heard character? And why is Alfred Molina role so small in this. His role seemed like it could had played a far more important one for the movie. It could at least had given the story some more depth with its entire court proceedings. Not an horrible movie but I just can't think of any reasons why you should ever watch it. 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I had put off watching it for a long time because I thought it would fall on standard clich&eacute;s in the telling of its murder mystery. But there's a lot to like here. For starters, the performances by the lead actors are first rate. Streep and Neeson come across as real people tackling a real problem. I should also add that Alfred Molina also gives a solid performance as the defense attorney. (Though the fact he looks like idiot movie critic Michael Medved gave me a few chuckles at times.) The script gives most of its characters a fair shake. The parents are sympathetic at times, but sometimes they make decisions we disapprove of. The townspeople and police are not one-note characters, showing off more than one side. The movie unfolds at a pace that keeps us interested and informed. It's directed with an appropriate bleak look that suits the subject matter. There is one flaw with the movie, however. I thought that Edward Furlong's character was repulsive, stupid, and hateful. I don't blame Furlong for this, but his direction and his parts of the screenplay. I think a better way the movie could have gone would be to give him a mixed view, neither overly sympathetic or hateful. This would make the viewer think long and hard about him, and wonder if his fate at the end of the movie is correct or not.

    This film is very plausible as it revolves around teenagers from families rich and average, how the average people see the rich one as money buying everything and the average ones disapprove of it; when in fact there are some rich families which don't think that way as seen in this film. This film is very feasible as it looks on behalf of one's personal development and how one focuses on how they suffered in a tragic process, the price we pay, focusing on life's lessons and every person and family has problems. It also shows how one deals with a problem in such a difficult situation and we see what happened then, and what has happened to us now. Watch the common plausible and feasible ways of life between the rich and average communities and people.

    How you could take Meryl Streep, Liam Nelson and Alfred Molina and only produce a half baked turkey like this is beyond me. But they did. The plot, as serpentine as it was, could have made sense. But it plays against human nature a good part of the time. Or maybe it was just the dialogue that wasn't human. I plugged along with this tired play only to see how it ended. It did. The idea that a 16 year old could get himself into so much trouble is not unbelievable. And after killing someone, even accidentally, one would probably become panic stricken. But I think it's human nature to try and hide the crime, not just leave all the clues and drive your family car home with blood in the trunk, including the mysterious bloody glove (where did that come from?) As for the father, he should stick with art. By trying to hide what he assumes is his son's crime, he only makes it worse. Meryl is a mother and she plays that part well. In fact she is the only believable character. Julia Weldon must be well connected because she can't act and that was a major drawback. The dichotomy of whether one should support family at all costs or seek the truth for all involved ( for the sake of society) is not new. As an artist, if he were from Bulgaria or some such country, Nelson's character might seem more believable. Everything is corrupt there. But here, we still assume that the innocent may get a fair shake, in spite of 6 years of the current regime's attempts to take away all rights of anyone they don't like. Never been a big fan of Furlong and his whining seems to be nearly continual in anything he does. Is there a casting call for whiners? There was a kernel of an idea in this movie, but without the proper care, it just became nutty.

Watch the common plausible and feasible ways of life between the rich and average communities and people.

    How you could take Meryl Streep, Liam Nelson and Alfred Molina and only produce a half baked turkey like this is beyond me. But they did. The plot, as serpentine as it was, could have made sense. But it plays against human nature a good part of the time. Or maybe it was just the dialogue that wasn't human. I plugged along with this tired play only to see how it ended. It did. The idea that a 16 year old could get himself into so much trouble is not unbelievable. And after killing someone, even accidentally, one would probably become panic stricken. But I think it's human nature to try and hide the crime, not just leave all the clues and drive your family car home with blood in the trunk, including the mysterious bloody glove (where did that come from?) As for the father, he should stick with art. By trying to hide what he assumes is his son's crime, he only makes it worse. Meryl is a mother and she plays that part well. In fact she is the only believable character. Julia Weldon must be well connected because she can't act and that was a major drawback. The dichotomy of whether one should support family at all costs or seek the truth for all involved ( for the sake of society) is not new. As an artist, if he were from Bulgaria or some such country, Nelson's character might seem more believable. Everything is corrupt there. But here, we still assume that the innocent may get a fair shake, in spite of 6 years of the current regime's attempts to take away all rights of anyone they don't like. Never been a big fan of Furlong and his whining seems to be nearly continual in anything he does. Is there a casting call for whiners? There was a kernel of an idea in this movie, but without the proper care, it just became nutty.

    Director Barbet Schroeder's curiously artificial drama, adapted from Rosellen Brown's book, concerns teenager Edward Furlong, a boy from a stable home, standing accused of killing his girlfriend in a snowy New England town. The family dynamics (with Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson as Furlong's parents) seem strangely off-kilter in a picture that depends on a realistic familial unit (it just doesn't come off, despite the talent involved). The film's editing is tight, while the cinematography and vividly-drawn flashbacks lend a much-needed sinister air to the proceedings. Unfortunately, Schroeder's direction overall is pitched far too high, as is Neeson's unsuccessful performance. A mildly intriguing near-miss. ** from ****

    At least MERYL STREEP is not required to don an accent for her role as a New England housewife whose son accidentally kills his girl friend during an argument--and the father, who deeply loves the boy, tries to cover up the crime by hiding the evidence. That's about the thrust of the plot--and the rest of the film has these three coping with the moral problems involved in not telling the whole truth to the lawyer assigned to defend the boy. Streep gives one of her more natural performances, as does LIAM NEESON as the upset father who needs some anger management. ED FURLONG is excellent as their sensitive, brooding son who realizes he can't go on lying about the whole matter, regardless of consequences. Well done and steers away from becoming the overwrought, overwhelmingly melodramatic film this would have been if it were made into a Joan Crawford film in the 1940s, with Joan protecting her child at all costs. The pace is too slow, but it's worth viewing if only to see Streep, Neeson and Furlong in excellent performances.

    It's amazing to read the reviews on these pages, how everyone has an opinion about films and especially a film that tries to be as close to real life as possible. Some find it a relevant character study, others are hung up on the plot holes. To be more precise, a gaping plot hole as the mystery of this plot is finally unfolded. To get in my point, this is a movie. It's not the best movie ever made, to me it doesn't really represent reality and there are plot holes, but I simply don't care. I am more interested if a movie can involve me or even change me in some way. Sad to say, this does not fall under that category. I am a great fan of both Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep. I will go as far as to say that Meryl Streep can play just about everything. But in playing a part that you perhaps invest a little too much of yourself in, you fall victim to either trying too hard not to show that you're acting or trying to overact. For this film, I wish the actors were a little more willing to overact. That would have made this a lot more enjoyable. Everything, from the characters reactions to the machinations of the plot seem overly calculated. There is not a big moment of release, as is normally usual in these types of film. Liam Neeson seems at first to be a buffoon in what he does to protect his son, but then we get reasoning, that what he did, is exactly what you should do in cases like these. A little too much of a coincidence, don't you think? As for Edward Furlong, he looks so tiny. It is actually brilliant casting because never in a million years, would you consider him a threat to anything. Liam Neeson looks like he could squash him with his thumb. Meryl Streep could probably kill him with one slap. There should not be made some significance about a movie like this. Don't dare call it reality. It is at least a distorted reality. Character study? They do a better job on something like any drama series you can think of.

    I read half of the reviews and boy, is there a difference of opinion. Some people feel the actors and plot suck, others are impressed with both. Put me in the latter category. Julia Weldon as the daughter who is wise beyond her years (hard to believe she's now in her 40s) is both appealing and convincing. As for Furlong, he was as tense and intense as the part demanded. One critic griped about him being so short compared to Neeson. Remember Michael Gross and Michael J. Fox? Those were really mixed genes. I could not put down Streep, one of today's strongest actresses. I felt she was as good as usual - meaning better than most; I always enjoy Neeson and am usually convinced that he is who he says he is. Some folks complained about plot holes. There were some loose ends, but they didn't bother me. That is the way this particular scenario played out. All in all, it kept me engrossed and, yes, I would recommend it - both 'Before' and 'After.'

    I'm probably repeating some of the issues already put forward concerning this film. The father in this movie is an utter ass. He acts only in his own self interest. If such a creep exists, we can see why the kid is a bit messed up. The plot follows the discovery of a young girl's body and a link to a young man (the son) who is connected to her. Once the father, played by Liam Neeson, goes bananas and starts destroying evidence, the die is cast. Meryl Streep's doctor/mother tries to look at things in a sane way, but she is constantly overpowered by her brutish husband. She is a realist and knows what needs to be done. The father makes it so much worse than it could have been that options are really limited. Also, Alfred Molina's lawyer role is so full of it. He chomps on a sandwich while talking about the most serious issue in the world. This is supposed to fill us with confidence (he may be eccentric but I'll bet he's really good). The script and the formulation of the events in this film, not to mention much of the acting just doesn't cut it very well.

    If you've read to this point in the reviews then I suppose you will not be distressed by spoilers, but be on the alert. I discuss the ending. Spoilers coming. This movie is about a family in crisis and I found it quite involving overall. It also raises ponder-worthy questions about personal and legal ethics. I was afraid it would end in typical Hollywood style with the kid getting off scotfree. But telling the truth doesn't give him a pass; he must suffer the consequences of his actions. Of course the aggressive gotta-win attorney thinks his clients have acted in their own worst interests. But have they? Father and son do some prison time and then, the film suggests, the family heals and each member of it can move forward with a clear conscience. I agree with some of the complaints aired here by others but not all. I thought the production values were fine. It's a cold movie, a twilight and night movie, and the murky snow-filled landscapes and shadowy interiors seemed perfect. I don't see how anyone can complain about Meryl Streep's performance, which is understated and nuanced. Neeson's character is fierce; it's gotta be played fiercely and Neeson comports himself well. The son and daughter were not as effective; these young actors lack vocal power and fail to put across any subtext.

    It's hard to understand why some movies ever got made. Who ever green-lighted this unconvincing and formulaic story to be filmed? And even bigger question, why did all of these great and established names committed themselves to this project? Thing with this movie its story is that it never reaches a level above average. No shocking surprises or twists, no real convincing emotions, no tension. It feels just like a very empty and distant movie. The story unfolds itself as a very unconvincing one, since some very unlikely things start to happen in the movie. I just never understood the fact why the parents weren't desperate to get the truth from their son. They just eat together as an happy family, when the son is being nothing but death silent about the whole situation. This would had ticked me off as a parent and would had driven me insane. Just imaging your son being the main suspect in a murder case but he doesn't say anything to you about what happened. I would feel so mad at him and terribly unsure but not Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep. Also the way how the entire suddenly seemed to be against the family seemed so incredibly forced and silly that it all became incredibly unconvincing. The movie doesn't make you sympathize enough for any of its characters or with its drama. It would had perhaps also helped if the boy was really innocent and had nothing to do with the death of the young girl at all. Yes, there definitely are far worse movies out there but that doesn't make this movie a good one. Even though the movie never gets above the level of average it also never goes below the level of horrible. It's just a very average movie, by the numbers. Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson, Alfred Molina, Edward Furlong and John Heard are all actors that appear in this movie and it really makes you wonder why. I just can't imaging after reading the script that they seriously thought this would make a great, powerful and effective movie, that would leave a lasting impression on people and could even sweep some awards. All actors make some mistake in their careers and this movie seems to be one for all of them. Also some actors just get terrible underused in this movie. What was the point of the John Heard character? And why is Alfred Molina role so small in this. His role seemed like it could had played a far more important one for the movie. It could at least had given the story some more depth with its entire court proceedings. Not an horrible movie but I just can't think of any reasons why you should ever watch it. 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I had put off watching it for a long time because I thought it would fall on standard clich&eacute;s in the telling of its murder mystery. But there's a lot to like here. For starters, the performances by the lead actors are first rate. Streep and Neeson come across as real people tackling a real problem. I should also add that Alfred Molina also gives a solid performance as the defense attorney. (Though the fact he looks like idiot movie critic Michael Medved gave me a few chuckles at times.) The script gives most of its characters a fair shake. The parents are sympathetic at times, but sometimes they make decisions we disapprove of. The townspeople and police are not one-note characters, showing off more than one side. The movie unfolds at a pace that keeps us interested and informed. It's directed with an appropriate bleak look that suits the subject matter. There is one flaw with the movie, however. I thought that Edward Furlong's character was repulsive, stupid, and hateful. I don't blame Furlong for this, but his direction and his parts of the screenplay. I think a better way the movie could have gone would be to give him a mixed view, neither overly sympathetic or hateful. This would make the viewer think long and hard about him, and wonder if his fate at the end of the movie is correct or not.

    This film is very plausible as it revolves around teenagers from families rich and average, how the average people see the rich one as money buying everything and the average ones disapprove of it; when in fact there are some rich families which don't think that way as seen in this film. This film is very feasible as it looks on behalf of one's personal development and how one focuses on how they suffered in a tragic process, the price we pay, focusing on life's lessons and every person and family has problems. It also shows how one deals with a problem in such a difficult situation and we see what happened then, and what has happened to us now.
