 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A convicted murderer on Death Row and the nun who befriends him. Through the portrayal of finely drawn characters and their interactions as the days, hours, and minutes tick down to the condemned man's execution, powerful emotions are unleashed. While Matthew Poncelet and Sister Prejean desperately try to gain a stay of execution from the governor or the courts, scenes are intercut from the brutal crime, gradually revealing the truth about the events that transpired.

    Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile. Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is. The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it. Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.

    DEAD MAN WALKING I remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards. It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing. It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment. The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on. Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable. The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry & R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.

    Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt. He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness. No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact. Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room. The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something. The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role. From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film. There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here. A movie that could've easily been arguing against the death penalty argument in a propaganda-like manner could've very well been the film we got. A film that took the issue vice-versa could've been, as well. The delicate approach we got is an incalculable rarity, and in present-day, a film similar to the quality of this one on issues like abortion and welfare would be something to truly value. The immediate problem would be getting people to come out of their comfort shell, see the fact that the film is presented in an unbiased light, and see them would be the challenge. Starring: Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Directed by: Tim Robbins.

    American actor, screenwriter and director Tim Robbins' second feature film as director which he wrote, is an adaptation of an autobiographical work of non-fiction from 1993 by American Sister Helen Prejean who is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. It was screened In competition at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and is a UK-USA co-production which Tim Robbins co-produced with producers Rudd Simmons and Jon Kiik. It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones. Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins. This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.

    This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens. It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him. The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love. This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past. This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.

    Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes. Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character. In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over. The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY. This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.

    Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact. Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue. Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar. Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.

    Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love. The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them. What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer. The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person. The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10

    Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na&iuml;ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10

    THE MOVIE AS A DEBATE: the movie is a significant contribution towards our understanding of the nature of the issue of capital punishment. and it has done an exceptional job in showing to us that sometimes it is not possible to take sides. The message is not put out there, it is hidden, not the obvious, and the movie doesn't try to look like it is propagating any message. a viewer could quiet possibly shift his stance from pro to against capital punishment or the other way around and at the end might have no opinion of all. Early in the movie when Mathew (Sean Penn) says that "i ain't killed anybody", you sort of wait to see if he really ain't a culprit, and sort of sympathize with a man on dead row, because you are not convinced that he is a culprit. Then the victim's parents grief and the horrible scenes from the murder site make you want to see the man who caused all of that dead. THE MOVIE AS ART: you definitely feel something is missing in the movie. it leaves you unsatisfied. there is little or no character development, and the acting is not so good. What makes this movie a worthwhile experience is the fact that it lets you peek into the last days of a man who is going to be executed, the people whose life he changed forever. and a good job has been done into achieving all of this. Scores are great and Nusrat Fateh Ali KHan just adds too much to the movie.

    Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile. Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is. The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it. Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.

    DEAD MAN WALKING I remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards. It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing. It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment. The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on. Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable. The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry & R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.

    Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt. He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness. No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact. Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room. The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something. The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role. From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film. There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here. A movie that could've easily been arguing against the death penalty argument in a propaganda-like manner could've very well been the film we got. A film that took the issue vice-versa could've been, as well. The delicate approach we got is an incalculable rarity, and in present-day, a film similar to the quality of this one on issues like abortion and welfare would be something to truly value. The immediate problem would be getting people to come out of their comfort shell, see the fact that the film is presented in an unbiased light, and see them would be the challenge. Starring: Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Directed by: Tim Robbins.

    American actor, screenwriter and director Tim Robbins' second feature film as director which he wrote, is an adaptation of an autobiographical work of non-fiction from 1993 by American Sister Helen Prejean who is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. It was screened In competition at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and is a UK-USA co-production which Tim Robbins co-produced with producers Rudd Simmons and Jon Kiik. It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones. Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins. This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.

    This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens. It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him. The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love. This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past. This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.

    Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes. Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character. In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over. The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY. This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.

    Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact. Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue. Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar. Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.

    Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love. The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them. What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer. The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person. The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10

    Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na&iuml;ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10

    Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile. Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is. The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it. Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.

    DEAD MAN WALKING I remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards. It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing. It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment. The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on. Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable. The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry & R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.

    Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt. He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness. No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact. Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room. The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something. The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role. From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film. There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here. A movie that could've easily been arguing against the death penalty argument in a propaganda-like manner could've very well been the film we got. A film that took the issue vice-versa could've been, as well. The delicate approach we got is an incalculable rarity, and in present-day, a film similar to the quality of this one on issues like abortion and welfare would be something to truly value. The immediate problem would be getting people to come out of their comfort shell, see the fact that the film is presented in an unbiased light, and see them would be the challenge. Starring: Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Directed by: Tim Robbins.

    American actor, screenwriter and director Tim Robbins' second feature film as director which he wrote, is an adaptation of an autobiographical work of non-fiction from 1993 by American Sister Helen Prejean who is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. It was screened In competition at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and is a UK-USA co-production which Tim Robbins co-produced with producers Rudd Simmons and Jon Kiik. It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones. Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins. This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.

    This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens. It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him. The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love. This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past. This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.

    Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes. Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character. In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over. The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY. This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.

    Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact. Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue. Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar. Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.

    Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love. The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them. What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer. The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person. The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10

    Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na&iuml;ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10

    THE MOVIE AS A DEBATE: the movie is a significant contribution towards our understanding of the nature of the issue of capital punishment. and it has done an exceptional job in showing to us that sometimes it is not possible to take sides. The message is not put out there, it is hidden, not the obvious, and the movie doesn't try to look like it is propagating any message. a viewer could quiet possibly shift his stance from pro to against capital punishment or the other way around and at the end might have no opinion of all. Early in the movie when Mathew (Sean Penn) says that "i ain't killed anybody", you sort of wait to see if he really ain't a culprit, and sort of sympathize with a man on dead row, because you are not convinced that he is a culprit. Then the victim's parents grief and the horrible scenes from the murder site make you want to see the man who caused all of that dead. THE MOVIE AS ART: you definitely feel something is missing in the movie. it leaves you unsatisfied. there is little or no character development, and the acting is not so good. What makes this movie a worthwhile experience is the fact that it lets you peek into the last days of a man who is going to be executed, the people whose life he changed forever. and a good job has been done into achieving all of this. Scores are great and Nusrat Fateh Ali KHan just adds too much to the movie.

    Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile. Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is. The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it. Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.

    DEAD MAN WALKING I remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards. It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing. It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment. The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on. Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable. The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry & R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.

    Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt. He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness. No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact. Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room. The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something. The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role. From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film. There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here. A movie that could've easily been arguing against the death penalty argument in a propaganda-like manner could've very well been the film we got. A film that took the issue vice-versa could've been, as well. The delicate approach we got is an incalculable rarity, and in present-day, a film similar to the quality of this one on issues like abortion and welfare would be something to truly value. The immediate problem would be getting people to come out of their comfort shell, see the fact that the film is presented in an unbiased light, and see them would be the challenge. Starring: Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Directed by: Tim Robbins.

    American actor, screenwriter and director Tim Robbins' second feature film as director which he wrote, is an adaptation of an autobiographical work of non-fiction from 1993 by American Sister Helen Prejean who is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. It was screened In competition at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and is a UK-USA co-production which Tim Robbins co-produced with producers Rudd Simmons and Jon Kiik. It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones. Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins. This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.

    This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens. It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him. The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love. This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past. This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.

    Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes. Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character. In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over. The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY. This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.

    Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact. Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue. Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar. Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.

    Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love. The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them. What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer. The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person. The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10

    Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na&iuml;ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10

    THE MOVIE AS A DEBATE: the movie is a significant contribution towards our understanding of the nature of the issue of capital punishment. and it has done an exceptional job in showing to us that sometimes it is not possible to take sides. The message is not put out there, it is hidden, not the obvious, and the movie doesn't try to look like it is propagating any message. a viewer could quiet possibly shift his stance from pro to against capital punishment or the other way around and at the end might have no opinion of all. Early in the movie when Mathew (Sean Penn) says that "i ain't killed anybody", you sort of wait to see if he really ain't a culprit, and sort of sympathize with a man on dead row, because you are not convinced that he is a culprit. Then the victim's parents grief and the horrible scenes from the murder site make you want to see the man who caused all of that dead. THE MOVIE AS ART: you definitely feel something is missing in the movie. it leaves you unsatisfied. there is little or no character development, and the acting is not so good. What makes this movie a worthwhile experience is the fact that it lets you peek into the last days of a man who is going to be executed, the people whose life he changed forever. and a good job has been done into achieving all of this. Scores are great and Nusrat Fateh Ali KHan just adds too much to the movie.

    Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile. Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is. The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it. Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.

    DEAD MAN WALKING I remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards. It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing. It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment. The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on. Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable. The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry & R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.

    Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt. He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness. No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact. Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room. The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something. The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role. From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film. There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here. A movie that could've easily been arguing against the death penalty argument in a propaganda-like manner could've very well been the film we got. A film that took the issue vice-versa could've been, as well. The delicate approach we got is an incalculable rarity, and in present-day, a film similar to the quality of this one on issues like abortion and welfare would be something to truly value. The immediate problem would be getting people to come out of their comfort shell, see the fact that the film is presented in an unbiased light, and see them would be the challenge. Starring: Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Directed by: Tim Robbins.

    American actor, screenwriter and director Tim Robbins' second feature film as director which he wrote, is an adaptation of an autobiographical work of non-fiction from 1993 by American Sister Helen Prejean who is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. It was screened In competition at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and is a UK-USA co-production which Tim Robbins co-produced with producers Rudd Simmons and Jon Kiik. It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones. Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins. This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.

    This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens. It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him. The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love. This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past. This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.

    Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes. Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character. In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over. The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY. This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.

    Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact. Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue. Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar. Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.

    Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love. The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them. What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer. The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person. The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10

    Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na&iuml;ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10

    THE MOVIE AS A DEBATE: the movie is a significant contribution towards our understanding of the nature of the issue of capital punishment. and it has done an exceptional job in showing to us that sometimes it is not possible to take sides. The message is not put out there, it is hidden, not the obvious, and the movie doesn't try to look like it is propagating any message. a viewer could quiet possibly shift his stance from pro to against capital punishment or the other way around and at the end might have no opinion of all. Early in the movie when Mathew (Sean Penn) says that "i ain't killed anybody", you sort of wait to see if he really ain't a culprit, and sort of sympathize with a man on dead row, because you are not convinced that he is a culprit. Then the victim's parents grief and the horrible scenes from the murder site make you want to see the man who caused all of that dead. THE MOVIE AS ART: you definitely feel something is missing in the movie. it leaves you unsatisfied. there is little or no character development, and the acting is not so good. What makes this movie a worthwhile experience is the fact that it lets you peek into the last days of a man who is going to be executed, the people whose life he changed forever. and a good job has been done into achieving all of this. Scores are great and Nusrat Fateh Ali KHan just adds too much to the movie.

    Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile. Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is. The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it. Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.

    DEAD MAN WALKING I remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards. It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing. It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment. The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on. Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable. The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry & R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.

    Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt. He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness. No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact. Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room. The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something. The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role. From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film. There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here. A movie that could've easily been arguing against the death penalty argument in a propaganda-like manner could've very well been the film we got. A film that took the issue vice-versa could've been, as well. The delicate approach we got is an incalculable rarity, and in present-day, a film similar to the quality of this one on issues like abortion and welfare would be something to truly value. The immediate problem would be getting people to come out of their comfort shell, see the fact that the film is presented in an unbiased light, and see them would be the challenge. Starring: Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Directed by: Tim Robbins.

    American actor, screenwriter and director Tim Robbins' second feature film as director which he wrote, is an adaptation of an autobiographical work of non-fiction from 1993 by American Sister Helen Prejean who is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. It was screened In competition at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and is a UK-USA co-production which Tim Robbins co-produced with producers Rudd Simmons and Jon Kiik. It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones. Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins. This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.

    This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens. It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him. The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love. This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past. This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.

    Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes. Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character. In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over. The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY. This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.

    Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact. Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue. Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar. Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.

    Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love. The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them. What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer. The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person. The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10

    Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na&iuml;ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10

    THE MOVIE AS A DEBATE: the movie is a significant contribution towards our understanding of the nature of the issue of capital punishment. and it has done an exceptional job in showing to us that sometimes it is not possible to take sides. The message is not put out there, it is hidden, not the obvious, and the movie doesn't try to look like it is propagating any message. a viewer could quiet possibly shift his stance from pro to against capital punishment or the other way around and at the end might have no opinion of all. Early in the movie when Mathew (Sean Penn) says that "i ain't killed anybody", you sort of wait to see if he really ain't a culprit, and sort of sympathize with a man on dead row, because you are not convinced that he is a culprit. Then the victim's parents grief and the horrible scenes from the murder site make you want to see the man who caused all of that dead. THE MOVIE AS ART: you definitely feel something is missing in the movie. it leaves you unsatisfied. there is little or no character development, and the acting is not so good. What makes this movie a worthwhile experience is the fact that it lets you peek into the last days of a man who is going to be executed, the people whose life he changed forever. and a good job has been done into achieving all of this. Scores are great and Nusrat Fateh Ali KHan just adds too much to the movie.

    Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile. Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is. The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it. Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.

    DEAD MAN WALKING I remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards. It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing. It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment. The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on. Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable. The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry & R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.

    Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt. He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness. No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact. Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room. The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something. The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role. From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film. There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here. A movie that could've easily been arguing against the death penalty argument in a propaganda-like manner could've very well been the film we got. A film that took the issue vice-versa could've been, as well. The delicate approach we got is an incalculable rarity, and in present-day, a film similar to the quality of this one on issues like abortion and welfare would be something to truly value. The immediate problem would be getting people to come out of their comfort shell, see the fact that the film is presented in an unbiased light, and see them would be the challenge. Starring: Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Directed by: Tim Robbins.

    American actor, screenwriter and director Tim Robbins' second feature film as director which he wrote, is an adaptation of an autobiographical work of non-fiction from 1993 by American Sister Helen Prejean who is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. It was screened In competition at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and is a UK-USA co-production which Tim Robbins co-produced with producers Rudd Simmons and Jon Kiik. It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones. Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins. This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.

    This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens. It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him. The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love. This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past. This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.

    Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes. Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character. In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over. The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY. This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.

    Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact. Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue. Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar. Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.

    Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love. The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them. What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer. The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person. The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10

    Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na&iuml;ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10

    THE MOVIE AS A DEBATE: the movie is a significant contribution towards our understanding of the nature of the issue of capital punishment. and it has done an exceptional job in showing to us that sometimes it is not possible to take sides. The message is not put out there, it is hidden, not the obvious, and the movie doesn't try to look like it is propagating any message. a viewer could quiet possibly shift his stance from pro to against capital punishment or the other way around and at the end might have no opinion of all. Early in the movie when Mathew (Sean Penn) says that "i ain't killed anybody", you sort of wait to see if he really ain't a culprit, and sort of sympathize with a man on dead row, because you are not convinced that he is a culprit. Then the victim's parents grief and the horrible scenes from the murder site make you want to see the man who caused all of that dead. THE MOVIE AS ART: you definitely feel something is missing in the movie. it leaves you unsatisfied. there is little or no character development, and the acting is not so good. What makes this movie a worthwhile experience is the fact that it lets you peek into the last days of a man who is going to be executed, the people whose life he changed forever. and a good job has been done into achieving all of this. Scores are great and Nusrat Fateh Ali KHan just adds too much to the movie.

    Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile. Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is. The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it. Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.

    DEAD MAN WALKING I remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards. It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing. It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment. The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on. Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable. The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry & R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.

    Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt. He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness. No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact. Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room. The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something. The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role. From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film. There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here. A movie that could've easily been arguing against the death penalty argument in a propaganda-like manner could've very well been the film we got. A film that took the issue vice-versa could've been, as well. The delicate approach we got is an incalculable rarity, and in present-day, a film similar to the quality of this one on issues like abortion and welfare would be something to truly value. The immediate problem would be getting people to come out of their comfort shell, see the fact that the film is presented in an unbiased light, and see them would be the challenge. Starring: Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Directed by: Tim Robbins.

    American actor, screenwriter and director Tim Robbins' second feature film as director which he wrote, is an adaptation of an autobiographical work of non-fiction from 1993 by American Sister Helen Prejean who is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. It was screened In competition at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and is a UK-USA co-production which Tim Robbins co-produced with producers Rudd Simmons and Jon Kiik. It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones. Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins. This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.

    This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens. It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him. The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love. This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past. This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.

    Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes. Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character. In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over. The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY. This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.

    Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact. Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue. Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar. Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.

    Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love. The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them. What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer. The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person. The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10

    Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na&iuml;ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10

    THE MOVIE AS A DEBATE: the movie is a significant contribution towards our understanding of the nature of the issue of capital punishment. and it has done an exceptional job in showing to us that sometimes it is not possible to take sides. The message is not put out there, it is hidden, not the obvious, and the movie doesn't try to look like it is propagating any message. a viewer could quiet possibly shift his stance from pro to against capital punishment or the other way around and at the end might have no opinion of all. Early in the movie when Mathew (Sean Penn) says that "i ain't killed anybody", you sort of wait to see if he really ain't a culprit, and sort of sympathize with a man on dead row, because you are not convinced that he is a culprit. Then the victim's parents grief and the horrible scenes from the murder site make you want to see the man who caused all of that dead. THE MOVIE AS ART: you definitely feel something is missing in the movie. it leaves you unsatisfied. there is little or no character development, and the acting is not so good. What makes this movie a worthwhile experience is the fact that it lets you peek into the last days of a man who is going to be executed, the people whose life he changed forever. and a good job has been done into achieving all of this. Scores are great and Nusrat Fateh Ali KHan just adds too much to the movie.

    Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile. Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is. The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it. Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.

    DEAD MAN WALKING I remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards. It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing. It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment. The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on. Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable. The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry & R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.

    Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt. He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness. No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact. Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room. The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something. The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role. From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film. There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here.

    American actor, screenwriter and director Tim Robbins' second feature film as director which he wrote, is an adaptation of an autobiographical work of non-fiction from 1993 by American Sister Helen Prejean who is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. It was screened In competition at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and is a UK-USA co-production which Tim Robbins co-produced with producers Rudd Simmons and Jon Kiik. It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones. Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins. This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.

    This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens. It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him. The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love. This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past. This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.

    Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes. Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character. In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over. The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY. This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.

    Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact. Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue. Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar. Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.

    Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love. The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them. What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer. The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person. The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10

    Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na&iuml;ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10

    THE MOVIE AS A DEBATE: the movie is a significant contribution towards our understanding of the nature of the issue of capital punishment. and it has done an exceptional job in showing to us that sometimes it is not possible to take sides. The message is not put out there, it is hidden, not the obvious, and the movie doesn't try to look like it is propagating any message. a viewer could quiet possibly shift his stance from pro to against capital punishment or the other way around and at the end might have no opinion of all. Early in the movie when Mathew (Sean Penn) says that "i ain't killed anybody", you sort of wait to see if he really ain't a culprit, and sort of sympathize with a man on dead row, because you are not convinced that he is a culprit. Then the victim's parents grief and the horrible scenes from the murder site make you want to see the man who caused all of that dead. THE MOVIE AS ART: you definitely feel something is missing in the movie. it leaves you unsatisfied. there is little or no character development, and the acting is not so good. What makes this movie a worthwhile experience is the fact that it lets you peek into the last days of a man who is going to be executed, the people whose life he changed forever. and a good job has been done into achieving all of this. Scores are great and Nusrat Fateh Ali KHan just adds too much to the movie.

    Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile. Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is. The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it. Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.

    DEAD MAN WALKING I remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards. It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing. It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment. The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on. Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable. The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry & R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable. I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.

    Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt. He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness. No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact. Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room. The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something. The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role. From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film. There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here. A movie that could've easily been arguing against the death penalty argument in a propaganda-like manner could've very well been the film we got. A film that took the issue vice-versa could've been, as well. The delicate approach we got is an incalculable rarity, and in present-day, a film similar to the quality of this one on issues like abortion and welfare would be something to truly value. The immediate problem would be getting people to come out of their comfort shell, see the fact that the film is presented in an unbiased light, and see them would be the challenge. Starring: Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Directed by: Tim Robbins.

It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones. Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins. This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.

    This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens. It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him. The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love. This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past. This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.

    Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes. Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character. In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over. The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY. This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.

    Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact. Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue. Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar. Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.

    Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love. The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them. What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer. The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person. The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10

    Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na&iuml;ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10

    THE MOVIE AS A DEBATE: the movie is a significant contribution towards our understanding of the nature of the issue of capital punishment. and it has done an exceptional job in showing to us that sometimes it is not possible to take sides. The message is not put out there, it is hidden, not the obvious, and the movie doesn't try to look like it is propagating any message. a viewer could quiet possibly shift his stance from pro to against capital punishment or the other way around and at the end might have no opinion of all. Early in the movie when Mathew (Sean Penn) says that "i ain't killed anybody", you sort of wait to see if he really ain't a culprit, and sort of sympathize with a man on dead row, because you are not convinced that he is a culprit. Then the victim's parents grief and the horrible scenes from the murder site make you want to see the man who caused all of that dead. THE MOVIE AS ART: you definitely feel something is missing in the movie. it leaves you unsatisfied. there is little or no character development, and the acting is not so good. What makes this movie a worthwhile experience is the fact that it lets you peek into the last days of a man who is going to be executed, the people whose life he changed forever. and a good job has been done into achieving all of this. Scores are great and Nusrat Fateh Ali KHan just adds too much to the movie.
