    I'm horribly shocked that this film is considered a romantic comedy, let alone one with many positive reviews. Whoever wrote the script and plot for this film should be shot. Seriously, how does Roberts losing the man she love in the end make it a romantic comedy worth seeing? And while the general consensus was that she was 'evil' and 'selfish', Jules struck me as more love-silly and desperate than evil and conniving (if any staunch negativity from Roberts part was intended then it wasn't well-acted at all). Roberts' character and the opposing guy both showed flaws and imperfections, but such is often the case with troubled people trying to sort out their real feelings in order to make the best relationship decision(s). Also, up until the end her friend acted as if he was secretly in love with her as well so the ending, aside from utterly depressing, didn't really make sense (unless that was also poor acting). That being said, this film would've been much better if they ended up together.

    Although it is perhaps most well-known for its unconventional ending, My Best Friend's Wedding should be known, for its perfect blend of romance and comedy, as the definitive rom-com. Julianne Potter (Roberts) is a New York food critic, who, after receiving a mysterious voicemail from her former lover and long-time best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney), realizes her affection for him. Unfortunately for her, upon returning Michael's call, Julianne learns that the new-found man of her dreams has himself met someone and intends to marry her within four days. Unaware of Julianne's recently acquired feelings for him, Michael insists that she join the wedding party in Chicago and support him in his hour of need. After some goading from her other best friend, George (Rupert Everett), Julianne decides to go in the hope of breaking up the couple before they can say their "I dos." The ensuing madness is both enchanting and hilarious, as Julianne finds herself being continually and innocuously bested by Michael's fianc&eacute;, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), resulting in a series of hilariously irate phone calls to George, who always happens to field them at the worst possible times (i.e. his entire family gets an earful from the answering machine over dinner.) Diaz and Roberts are perfect comedic matches for one another as the innocently saccharine fianc&eacute; and the plotting best friend, and Mulroney is so suave and sexy as "the man of our dreams" (as Roberts puts it) that it's incredible more of the film's female population aren't fighting for his affection. Everett is equally well cast in the role of George, the gay best friend who plays it straight at one point for Julianne's sake. His scenes provide some of the film's funniest moments, particularly when George teasingly embarrasses Julianne in front of the rest of the wedding party by launching into his rendition of "I'll Say a Little Prayer (For You)." Aside from just its comedy, which is considerable, and its romance, which is unorthodox, "My Best Friend's Wedding" succeeds because its characters are fully-formed, dimensional beings who live in a very real world. Julianne, with all of her charm and charisma, is really just a desperate, wavering soul who fears what might happen if everyone finds happiness besides her. Kimmy, instead of being flat and static (as the "other" girl is wont to be in a romantic comedy), is a likable and endearing character that the audience can empathize with. Michael, however, is perhaps the most fascinating character of them all. Michael is both the perfect best friend- teasing and adoring, while never crossing the line- and the perfect boyfriend. He balances his affection for both of the women in his life and draws his own line regarding the ways in which he can love each of them. His decisions and character both break the traditional mold of a romantic comedy's "dream guy" by injecting a measure of reality and at the same time uphold it, by demonstrating that there is a way in which a strong, selfless, and moral man can exist without becoming a mere fantasy.

    My Best Friend's Wedding is a film that stars Julia Roberts.A woman realizes that friends can be lovers, but now has to convince the friend in question in this romantic comedy.Cameron Diaz, Dermot Mulroney, Rupert Everett, and Philip Bosco co-star to play key supporting roles.It was directed by P. J. Hogan. Michael and Julianne were romantically involved in college, and after breaking up, they have managed to remain close friends. For years, they have had a pledge that if both were single when they turned 28, they would get married. Shortly before her 28th birthday, Julianne is lamenting the sad state of her love life when she gets a call from Michael, who announces that he has important news. Julianne is convinced that Michael is going to ask her to marry him, and she is crestfallen when he announces that he's engaged to Kimmy Wallace. Kimmy seems like the perfect woman for Michael because she's sweet, pretty, bright, and adores Michael, and her wealthy family is just as fond of him as she is. But now that Julianne has realized how much she loves Michael, she's not about to give him up without a fight and isn't afraid to fight dirty. Julianne's uneasy ally in the battle for Michael's affections is her friend and editor George Downes, a cheerfully out-of-the-closet homosexual who is not prepared when Julianne asks him to pose as her boyfriend. One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990's, My Best Friend's Wedding not only gave Julia Roberts a delightful vehicle for her crowd- pleasing comeback, but it further distinguished itself by avoiding the conventional plotting of the genre.Thanks to her charming performance and a subversive spin on the genre, this movie is a refreshingly entertaining.Rupert Everett scored rave reviews for his scene-stealing performance as Robert's gay friend who goes along with her scheming, and even as she makes her character's needy desperation disarmingly appealing, Roberts wisely allows Diaz to capitalize on her charming time in the spotlight. As the romantic outcome remains uncertain, the viewer is held in a state of giddy suspense, and director Hogan pulls off some hilarious scenes that could easily have fallen flat in the hands of a less talented filmmaker.Also, Hogan does manage to make his attractive leads look like complete idiots, no mean achievement in image-obsessed Hollywood.No wonder it happens to be the second most popular film of Roberts after Pretty Woman.

    From what I've read here on IMDb this one split the vote straight down the middle, seems you either love it or loathe it. I found a lot to admire and little to dislike. It comes out of a long tradition that dates back to the earliest talkies; attractive, affluent people, living in luxurious apartments/houses, wearing expensive clothes, dining in expensive restaurants and generally being charming and romantic. We've been there with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, Grant and Katherine Hepburn, Grant and Ingrid Bergman, Fred and Ginger, Claudette Colbert, Audrey Hepburn, Franchot Tone, Bill Holden, Doris Day, Rock Hudson and now the new generation, epitomized here by Julia Roberts. The story is relatively unimportant, all we ask is twelve reels of escapism, a set piece or two, a song or two, lots of laughter balanced by the odd tear, a souffl&eacute;' that segues into a lemon mousse and sends us out into the night with a smile on our face and warmth in our heart. This one delivers as well as any and better than most.

    nice, sweet, intelligent, seductive comedy. sure, not great but perfect for be more than a new pink story. Rupert Everett is perfect key for tale, Julia Roberts is perfect choice for ex girl friend but the axis, the top and the heart of film is Cameron Diaz in one of her best roles. it is a good film because it is excellent puzzle. love, hate, humor, vulnerability, the bitch, the innocent young woman, the naive lover and slices of meetings are directed with precise and full of grace art. so, it is a comedy and little more. picture of choices and shadows of past, subtle nuances of dialogs and a wise cast are central pieces of a build in which all is basket of crumbs from a hided Shakespeare.

    Granted, I should never have walked into this one but it was Tight-arse Tuesday so I wasn't fussy. The musical piece at the restaurant was nicely done, but I refuse to believe that the lead man would pass up on a smart, pretty Julia Roberts then commit to an annoying blonde whose beauty is not even skin deep (Diaz looked fantastic in The Mask but she must have been wearing one at the time). I soldiered on thru the obvious cigarette ad in the hallway, but as the wedding approached, i honestly didn't care who did what. Amazingly, my mate felt exactly the same and we walked out after nothing more than a nod and a wink. No spoilers here: I still don't know the ending..

    How true was My Best Friend's Wedding? Well, I've lived it, and yes, I was the bad guy. Sure, I didn't sabotage a wedding, nor someone's life. But, I didn't partake in a lot of the jealousy and plots she did, sadly enough. So, I'm neither proud or ashamed of what I did in my own existence, I can safely say, what she did in this fantastic movie, was true-to-life. Let's get the synopsis out of the way: non-committal Julianne (Julia Roberts) has a best (male) friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) she once dated and they made a pack: if neither is married by a certain age, then they will settle (is that the right word  even though they didn't state that themselves?) and marry each other. Julianne receives a call/voice mail out of the bluecoincidently enough, close to the birthday of said agefrom Michael. Immediately, she thinks it's a proposal. Close enough: he's announcing his (quick) engagement to Kim (Cameron Diaz) and he wants Julianne to be there for him. While thrust into the wedding arrangements and "best man's role," she plots to apply a large wedge between the happy couple in order to get Michael all to herself, despite her own spiritual conscience and a physical one, in the form of her (other best) friend, George (Rupert Everett) and his constant pleas for her to do the right thing: be honest with him and let the happy couple marry. The movie is both extremely humorous and deep. It's heartfelt and real, while delivering fantastic one-liners with a great soundtrack. It could literally happen, and probably does  again, I'm proof. Okay, mine dealt with a best friend of mine that I was in love with for many years. Though we "acted" upon it multiple times  and I am surely downplaying that, my half of the relationship was built on pure love. Unfortunately, not only was the feelings not reciprocated, but I was told constantly, despite the repetitiveness of the actions, that this was anything but unemotional. I saw a lot in Julianne that I saw within myself. Hers, thankfully, ended in a weekend per the movie's timeline. Miserably, mine lasted seven years. Enough about me. Suffice to say, I KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING THRU. And beyond that, the movie lifts me up, makes me laugh and definitely makes me cry  each and every time I see it. It's both lighthearted and deep. It has fantastic scenes individually and on a whole  such as the singing group, led by a wonderful Rupert Everett for "I Say A Little Prayer." It's one of my all-time favorite films and soundtracks. Ever been through this? Have you ever loved someone so much it hurt? Physically? Ever act on it, even though you know that was the wrong course? WATCH this movie. Live it. Love it. And watch one of the most realistic endings Hollywood has ever produced. It may not be the finale you were looking for, but it's the most honest.

    This movie was very cute and had a lot of funny little parts in it. It has Julie Roberts AND Cameron Diaz so who could go wrong? Good acting and storyline. The gentlemen in the movie are also charming and handsome. It has some heartwarming parts and other parts of suspense and comedy. A must see for the romantic at heart. I always imagine Julie Roberts as sweet and innocent and although "adorable" as always in this movie, she plays a somewhat jealous and sneaky "best friend" who tries to ruin the wedding because she hasn't ever had the courage to tell her best friend she is in love with him. Is she truly in love or is she just suffering doubts about her feelings for her long time friend? We may never know. I think she's a lucky lady either way her heart is turned because she has TWO handsome male best friends in this movie! That's another cute thing about this movie... to see two strong male roles that are not vulgar or hostile towards women but romantic and supportive. A refreshing change from some other stereotypical male roles we see a lot of these days. Cool movie.. I give it an 8/10!

    This was one movie ending that we thoroughly agreed with - and not because the couple got together, but because they didn't. Jules Potter is way too selfish to be in a relationship with anyone. Jules and Michael have been friends since college, and one year they made a pact that if neither of them were married by the time they were 28 (really? Did they go to school in Utah?) they would marry each other. When Michael calls on the eve (eve eve) of Jules' birthday she assumes it's to call in his marker. When she finds out that he is instead calling to announce that he's engaged to someone else, Jules suddenly decides that he's the one for her, and spends the next three days doing everything in her power to break up the clearly happy couple. Talk about wanting what you can't have. Jules doesn't want to win Michael over; she just wants to win. Is this really how you treat your best friend? Clearly not, as Jules doesn't win the guy in the end after all. Three days of sabotage - flirting, prancing about in her underwear, trying to provoke Michael's jealousy by pretending to be engaged to her best gay friend George, attempting to humiliate Kimmy, the bride-to-be, in a karaoke bar, sending manipulative emails from Kimmy's father, and finally - confessing her newly discovered "love" for Michael and forcing her lips on him - are all done in vain. Just when you're wondering how much farther she'll take it, Jules finally comes to the realization that Michael's love for Kimmy cannot be swayed by her cheap antics. And in the end it's Michael and Kimmy who get married and sail off into the sunset. We shudder to think what happens when George announces he's met someone. Will she prance around him in Gucci couture? Move to Chelsea? Have a sex change operation? We think Michael, Kimmy and George need to find some new friends. www.reel-couples.com

    It came to 27-year-old New York restaurant critic Julianne Potter's (Julia Roberts) attention when she was having a meal with her gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett). Longtime friend Michael O'Neil had called her to say that he is going to get married in four days' time, to Kimberley Wallace (Cameron Diaz), who is a University of Chicago student from a wealthy family. It upsets Julianne, knowing that back in college, he and Michael had made an agreement that if they were not married by the time they reach 28, they will marry each other. But not only that, Michael had only known the 20-year-old Kimberley for a short period of time. Julianne realises that she is in love with her longtime friend and set out to prevent the wedding from taking place. While at the same time, to be Kimberley's maid of honour. It sets off a series of comical sequences like taking Kimberley and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimberley is a terrible singer and asking the gay friend George to pretend that they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous of Julianne. Unfortunately the plans did not work. George then advised Julianne to do the obvious: Tell Michael up front that she is in love with him. So on the morning of the wedding, Julianne finally confessed her true feelings to her longtime friend, asked him to marry her instead, and kisses him. Kimberley unfortunately saw it all and ran off with Michael chasing her, and Julianne chases him unsuccessfully...or so she thought. She spotted Michael at the train station and finally accepted the fact that she has lost Michael to Kimberley. She went to apologise to Kimberley and explained the whole situation, including that he did not kissed her back. The wedding did took place after all, with Julianne as Kimberley's maid of honour wishing them well. And she being consoled by George as well. To have Julia Roberts playing the role of the person to steal her friend's future spouse may be just wrong given one does not associate her in that kind of role, but one probably cannot help but wonder whether she can do it in the end. Whether one was rooting for Julia Roberts in her role as Julianne or not, there is also other reasons to like this film. Like the supporting cast especially Rupert Everett as George.

    How true was My Best Friend's Wedding? Well, I've lived it, and yes, I was the bad guy. Sure, I didn't sabotage a wedding, nor someone's life. But, I didn't partake in a lot of the jealousy and plots she did, sadly enough. So, I'm neither proud or ashamed of what I did in my own existence, I can safely say, what she did in this fantastic movie, was true-to-life. Let's get the synopsis out of the way: non-committal Julianne (Julia Roberts) has a best (male) friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) she once dated and they made a pack: if neither is married by a certain age, then they will settle (is that the right word  even though they didn't state that themselves?) and marry each other. Julianne receives a call/voice mail out of the bluecoincidently enough, close to the birthday of said agefrom Michael. Immediately, she thinks it's a proposal. Close enough: he's announcing his (quick) engagement to Kim (Cameron Diaz) and he wants Julianne to be there for him. While thrust into the wedding arrangements and "best man's role," she plots to apply a large wedge between the happy couple in order to get Michael all to herself, despite her own spiritual conscience and a physical one, in the form of her (other best) friend, George (Rupert Everett) and his constant pleas for her to do the right thing: be honest with him and let the happy couple marry. The movie is both extremely humorous and deep. It's heartfelt and real, while delivering fantastic one-liners with a great soundtrack. It could literally happen, and probably does  again, I'm proof. Okay, mine dealt with a best friend of mine that I was in love with for many years. Though we "acted" upon it multiple times  and I am surely downplaying that, my half of the relationship was built on pure love. Unfortunately, not only was the feelings not reciprocated, but I was told constantly, despite the repetitiveness of the actions, that this was anything but unemotional. I saw a lot in Julianne that I saw within myself. Hers, thankfully, ended in a weekend per the movie's timeline. Miserably, mine lasted seven years. Enough about me. Suffice to say, I KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING THRU. And beyond that, the movie lifts me up, makes me laugh and definitely makes me cry  each and every time I see it. It's both lighthearted and deep. It has fantastic scenes individually and on a whole  such as the singing group, led by a wonderful Rupert Everett for "I Say A Little Prayer." It's one of my all-time favorite films and soundtracks. Ever been through this? Have you ever loved someone so much it hurt? Physically? Ever act on it, even though you know that was the wrong course? WATCH this movie. Live it. Love it. And watch one of the most realistic endings Hollywood has ever produced. It may not be the finale you were looking for, but it's the most honest.

    This movie was very cute and had a lot of funny little parts in it. It has Julie Roberts AND Cameron Diaz so who could go wrong? Good acting and storyline. The gentlemen in the movie are also charming and handsome. It has some heartwarming parts and other parts of suspense and comedy. A must see for the romantic at heart. I always imagine Julie Roberts as sweet and innocent and although "adorable" as always in this movie, she plays a somewhat jealous and sneaky "best friend" who tries to ruin the wedding because she hasn't ever had the courage to tell her best friend she is in love with him. Is she truly in love or is she just suffering doubts about her feelings for her long time friend? We may never know. I think she's a lucky lady either way her heart is turned because she has TWO handsome male best friends in this movie! That's another cute thing about this movie... to see two strong male roles that are not vulgar or hostile towards women but romantic and supportive. A refreshing change from some other stereotypical male roles we see a lot of these days. Cool movie.. I give it an 8/10!

    This was one movie ending that we thoroughly agreed with - and not because the couple got together, but because they didn't. Jules Potter is way too selfish to be in a relationship with anyone. Jules and Michael have been friends since college, and one year they made a pact that if neither of them were married by the time they were 28 (really? Did they go to school in Utah?) they would marry each other. When Michael calls on the eve (eve eve) of Jules' birthday she assumes it's to call in his marker. When she finds out that he is instead calling to announce that he's engaged to someone else, Jules suddenly decides that he's the one for her, and spends the next three days doing everything in her power to break up the clearly happy couple. Talk about wanting what you can't have. Jules doesn't want to win Michael over; she just wants to win. Is this really how you treat your best friend? Clearly not, as Jules doesn't win the guy in the end after all. Three days of sabotage - flirting, prancing about in her underwear, trying to provoke Michael's jealousy by pretending to be engaged to her best gay friend George, attempting to humiliate Kimmy, the bride-to-be, in a karaoke bar, sending manipulative emails from Kimmy's father, and finally - confessing her newly discovered "love" for Michael and forcing her lips on him - are all done in vain. Just when you're wondering how much farther she'll take it, Jules finally comes to the realization that Michael's love for Kimmy cannot be swayed by her cheap antics. And in the end it's Michael and Kimmy who get married and sail off into the sunset. We shudder to think what happens when George announces he's met someone. Will she prance around him in Gucci couture? Move to Chelsea? Have a sex change operation? We think Michael, Kimmy and George need to find some new friends. www.reel-couples.com

    It came to 27-year-old New York restaurant critic Julianne Potter's (Julia Roberts) attention when she was having a meal with her gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett). Longtime friend Michael O'Neil had called her to say that he is going to get married in four days' time, to Kimberley Wallace (Cameron Diaz), who is a University of Chicago student from a wealthy family. It upsets Julianne, knowing that back in college, he and Michael had made an agreement that if they were not married by the time they reach 28, they will marry each other. But not only that, Michael had only known the 20-year-old Kimberley for a short period of time. Julianne realises that she is in love with her longtime friend and set out to prevent the wedding from taking place. While at the same time, to be Kimberley's maid of honour. It sets off a series of comical sequences like taking Kimberley and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimberley is a terrible singer and asking the gay friend George to pretend that they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous of Julianne. Unfortunately the plans did not work. George then advised Julianne to do the obvious: Tell Michael up front that she is in love with him. So on the morning of the wedding, Julianne finally confessed her true feelings to her longtime friend, asked him to marry her instead, and kisses him. Kimberley unfortunately saw it all and ran off with Michael chasing her, and Julianne chases him unsuccessfully...or so she thought. She spotted Michael at the train station and finally accepted the fact that she has lost Michael to Kimberley. She went to apologise to Kimberley and explained the whole situation, including that he did not kissed her back. The wedding did took place after all, with Julianne as Kimberley's maid of honour wishing them well. And she being consoled by George as well. To have Julia Roberts playing the role of the person to steal her friend's future spouse may be just wrong given one does not associate her in that kind of role, but one probably cannot help but wonder whether she can do it in the end. Whether one was rooting for Julia Roberts in her role as Julianne or not, there is also other reasons to like this film. Like the supporting cast especially Rupert Everett as George.

    I'm horribly shocked that this film is considered a romantic comedy, let alone one with many positive reviews. Whoever wrote the script and plot for this film should be shot. Seriously, how does Roberts losing the man she love in the end make it a romantic comedy worth seeing? And while the general consensus was that she was 'evil' and 'selfish', Jules struck me as more love-silly and desperate than evil and conniving (if any staunch negativity from Roberts part was intended then it wasn't well-acted at all). Roberts' character and the opposing guy both showed flaws and imperfections, but such is often the case with troubled people trying to sort out their real feelings in order to make the best relationship decision(s). Also, up until the end her friend acted as if he was secretly in love with her as well so the ending, aside from utterly depressing, didn't really make sense (unless that was also poor acting). That being said, this film would've been much better if they ended up together.

    Although it is perhaps most well-known for its unconventional ending, My Best Friend's Wedding should be known, for its perfect blend of romance and comedy, as the definitive rom-com. Julianne Potter (Roberts) is a New York food critic, who, after receiving a mysterious voicemail from her former lover and long-time best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney), realizes her affection for him. Unfortunately for her, upon returning Michael's call, Julianne learns that the new-found man of her dreams has himself met someone and intends to marry her within four days. Unaware of Julianne's recently acquired feelings for him, Michael insists that she join the wedding party in Chicago and support him in his hour of need. After some goading from her other best friend, George (Rupert Everett), Julianne decides to go in the hope of breaking up the couple before they can say their "I dos." The ensuing madness is both enchanting and hilarious, as Julianne finds herself being continually and innocuously bested by Michael's fianc&eacute;, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), resulting in a series of hilariously irate phone calls to George, who always happens to field them at the worst possible times (i.e. his entire family gets an earful from the answering machine over dinner.) Diaz and Roberts are perfect comedic matches for one another as the innocently saccharine fianc&eacute; and the plotting best friend, and Mulroney is so suave and sexy as "the man of our dreams" (as Roberts puts it) that it's incredible more of the film's female population aren't fighting for his affection. Everett is equally well cast in the role of George, the gay best friend who plays it straight at one point for Julianne's sake. His scenes provide some of the film's funniest moments, particularly when George teasingly embarrasses Julianne in front of the rest of the wedding party by launching into his rendition of "I'll Say a Little Prayer (For You)." Aside from just its comedy, which is considerable, and its romance, which is unorthodox, "My Best Friend's Wedding" succeeds because its characters are fully-formed, dimensional beings who live in a very real world. Julianne, with all of her charm and charisma, is really just a desperate, wavering soul who fears what might happen if everyone finds happiness besides her. Kimmy, instead of being flat and static (as the "other" girl is wont to be in a romantic comedy), is a likable and endearing character that the audience can empathize with. Michael, however, is perhaps the most fascinating character of them all. Michael is both the perfect best friend- teasing and adoring, while never crossing the line- and the perfect boyfriend. He balances his affection for both of the women in his life and draws his own line regarding the ways in which he can love each of them. His decisions and character both break the traditional mold of a romantic comedy's "dream guy" by injecting a measure of reality and at the same time uphold it, by demonstrating that there is a way in which a strong, selfless, and moral man can exist without becoming a mere fantasy.

    My Best Friend's Wedding is a film that stars Julia Roberts.A woman realizes that friends can be lovers, but now has to convince the friend in question in this romantic comedy.Cameron Diaz, Dermot Mulroney, Rupert Everett, and Philip Bosco co-star to play key supporting roles.It was directed by P. J. Hogan. Michael and Julianne were romantically involved in college, and after breaking up, they have managed to remain close friends. For years, they have had a pledge that if both were single when they turned 28, they would get married. Shortly before her 28th birthday, Julianne is lamenting the sad state of her love life when she gets a call from Michael, who announces that he has important news. Julianne is convinced that Michael is going to ask her to marry him, and she is crestfallen when he announces that he's engaged to Kimmy Wallace. Kimmy seems like the perfect woman for Michael because she's sweet, pretty, bright, and adores Michael, and her wealthy family is just as fond of him as she is. But now that Julianne has realized how much she loves Michael, she's not about to give him up without a fight and isn't afraid to fight dirty. Julianne's uneasy ally in the battle for Michael's affections is her friend and editor George Downes, a cheerfully out-of-the-closet homosexual who is not prepared when Julianne asks him to pose as her boyfriend. One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990's, My Best Friend's Wedding not only gave Julia Roberts a delightful vehicle for her crowd- pleasing comeback, but it further distinguished itself by avoiding the conventional plotting of the genre.Thanks to her charming performance and a subversive spin on the genre, this movie is a refreshingly entertaining.Rupert Everett scored rave reviews for his scene-stealing performance as Robert's gay friend who goes along with her scheming, and even as she makes her character's needy desperation disarmingly appealing, Roberts wisely allows Diaz to capitalize on her charming time in the spotlight. As the romantic outcome remains uncertain, the viewer is held in a state of giddy suspense, and director Hogan pulls off some hilarious scenes that could easily have fallen flat in the hands of a less talented filmmaker.Also, Hogan does manage to make his attractive leads look like complete idiots, no mean achievement in image-obsessed Hollywood.No wonder it happens to be the second most popular film of Roberts after Pretty Woman.

    From what I've read here on IMDb this one split the vote straight down the middle, seems you either love it or loathe it. I found a lot to admire and little to dislike. It comes out of a long tradition that dates back to the earliest talkies; attractive, affluent people, living in luxurious apartments/houses, wearing expensive clothes, dining in expensive restaurants and generally being charming and romantic. We've been there with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, Grant and Katherine Hepburn, Grant and Ingrid Bergman, Fred and Ginger, Claudette Colbert, Audrey Hepburn, Franchot Tone, Bill Holden, Doris Day, Rock Hudson and now the new generation, epitomized here by Julia Roberts. The story is relatively unimportant, all we ask is twelve reels of escapism, a set piece or two, a song or two, lots of laughter balanced by the odd tear, a souffl&eacute;' that segues into a lemon mousse and sends us out into the night with a smile on our face and warmth in our heart. This one delivers as well as any and better than most.

    nice, sweet, intelligent, seductive comedy. sure, not great but perfect for be more than a new pink story. Rupert Everett is perfect key for tale, Julia Roberts is perfect choice for ex girl friend but the axis, the top and the heart of film is Cameron Diaz in one of her best roles. it is a good film because it is excellent puzzle. love, hate, humor, vulnerability, the bitch, the innocent young woman, the naive lover and slices of meetings are directed with precise and full of grace art. so, it is a comedy and little more. picture of choices and shadows of past, subtle nuances of dialogs and a wise cast are central pieces of a build in which all is basket of crumbs from a hided Shakespeare.

    Granted, I should never have walked into this one but it was Tight-arse Tuesday so I wasn't fussy. The musical piece at the restaurant was nicely done, but I refuse to believe that the lead man would pass up on a smart, pretty Julia Roberts then commit to an annoying blonde whose beauty is not even skin deep (Diaz looked fantastic in The Mask but she must have been wearing one at the time). I soldiered on thru the obvious cigarette ad in the hallway, but as the wedding approached, i honestly didn't care who did what. Amazingly, my mate felt exactly the same and we walked out after nothing more than a nod and a wink. No spoilers here: I still don't know the ending..

His scenes provide some of the film's funniest moments, particularly when George teasingly embarrasses Julianne in front of the rest of the wedding party by launching into his rendition of "I'll Say a Little Prayer (For You)." Aside from just its comedy, which is considerable, and its romance, which is unorthodox, "My Best Friend's Wedding" succeeds because its characters are fully-formed, dimensional beings who live in a very real world. Julianne, with all of her charm and charisma, is really just a desperate, wavering soul who fears what might happen if everyone finds happiness besides her. Kimmy, instead of being flat and static (as the "other" girl is wont to be in a romantic comedy), is a likable and endearing character that the audience can empathize with. Michael, however, is perhaps the most fascinating character of them all. Michael is both the perfect best friend- teasing and adoring, while never crossing the line- and the perfect boyfriend. He balances his affection for both of the women in his life and draws his own line regarding the ways in which he can love each of them. His decisions and character both break the traditional mold of a romantic comedy's "dream guy" by injecting a measure of reality and at the same time uphold it, by demonstrating that there is a way in which a strong, selfless, and moral man can exist without becoming a mere fantasy.

    My Best Friend's Wedding is a film that stars Julia Roberts.A woman realizes that friends can be lovers, but now has to convince the friend in question in this romantic comedy.Cameron Diaz, Dermot Mulroney, Rupert Everett, and Philip Bosco co-star to play key supporting roles.It was directed by P. J. Hogan. Michael and Julianne were romantically involved in college, and after breaking up, they have managed to remain close friends. For years, they have had a pledge that if both were single when they turned 28, they would get married. Shortly before her 28th birthday, Julianne is lamenting the sad state of her love life when she gets a call from Michael, who announces that he has important news. Julianne is convinced that Michael is going to ask her to marry him, and she is crestfallen when he announces that he's engaged to Kimmy Wallace. Kimmy seems like the perfect woman for Michael because she's sweet, pretty, bright, and adores Michael, and her wealthy family is just as fond of him as she is. But now that Julianne has realized how much she loves Michael, she's not about to give him up without a fight and isn't afraid to fight dirty. Julianne's uneasy ally in the battle for Michael's affections is her friend and editor George Downes, a cheerfully out-of-the-closet homosexual who is not prepared when Julianne asks him to pose as her boyfriend. One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990's, My Best Friend's Wedding not only gave Julia Roberts a delightful vehicle for her crowd- pleasing comeback, but it further distinguished itself by avoiding the conventional plotting of the genre.Thanks to her charming performance and a subversive spin on the genre, this movie is a refreshingly entertaining.Rupert Everett scored rave reviews for his scene-stealing performance as Robert's gay friend who goes along with her scheming, and even as she makes her character's needy desperation disarmingly appealing, Roberts wisely allows Diaz to capitalize on her charming time in the spotlight. As the romantic outcome remains uncertain, the viewer is held in a state of giddy suspense, and director Hogan pulls off some hilarious scenes that could easily have fallen flat in the hands of a less talented filmmaker.Also, Hogan does manage to make his attractive leads look like complete idiots, no mean achievement in image-obsessed Hollywood.No wonder it happens to be the second most popular film of Roberts after Pretty Woman.

    From what I've read here on IMDb this one split the vote straight down the middle, seems you either love it or loathe it. I found a lot to admire and little to dislike. It comes out of a long tradition that dates back to the earliest talkies; attractive, affluent people, living in luxurious apartments/houses, wearing expensive clothes, dining in expensive restaurants and generally being charming and romantic. We've been there with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, Grant and Katherine Hepburn, Grant and Ingrid Bergman, Fred and Ginger, Claudette Colbert, Audrey Hepburn, Franchot Tone, Bill Holden, Doris Day, Rock Hudson and now the new generation, epitomized here by Julia Roberts. The story is relatively unimportant, all we ask is twelve reels of escapism, a set piece or two, a song or two, lots of laughter balanced by the odd tear, a souffl&eacute;' that segues into a lemon mousse and sends us out into the night with a smile on our face and warmth in our heart. This one delivers as well as any and better than most.

    nice, sweet, intelligent, seductive comedy. sure, not great but perfect for be more than a new pink story. Rupert Everett is perfect key for tale, Julia Roberts is perfect choice for ex girl friend but the axis, the top and the heart of film is Cameron Diaz in one of her best roles. it is a good film because it is excellent puzzle. love, hate, humor, vulnerability, the bitch, the innocent young woman, the naive lover and slices of meetings are directed with precise and full of grace art. so, it is a comedy and little more. picture of choices and shadows of past, subtle nuances of dialogs and a wise cast are central pieces of a build in which all is basket of crumbs from a hided Shakespeare.

    Granted, I should never have walked into this one but it was Tight-arse Tuesday so I wasn't fussy. The musical piece at the restaurant was nicely done, but I refuse to believe that the lead man would pass up on a smart, pretty Julia Roberts then commit to an annoying blonde whose beauty is not even skin deep (Diaz looked fantastic in The Mask but she must have been wearing one at the time). I soldiered on thru the obvious cigarette ad in the hallway, but as the wedding approached, i honestly didn't care who did what. Amazingly, my mate felt exactly the same and we walked out after nothing more than a nod and a wink. No spoilers here: I still don't know the ending..

    How true was My Best Friend's Wedding? Well, I've lived it, and yes, I was the bad guy. Sure, I didn't sabotage a wedding, nor someone's life. But, I didn't partake in a lot of the jealousy and plots she did, sadly enough. So, I'm neither proud or ashamed of what I did in my own existence, I can safely say, what she did in this fantastic movie, was true-to-life. Let's get the synopsis out of the way: non-committal Julianne (Julia Roberts) has a best (male) friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) she once dated and they made a pack: if neither is married by a certain age, then they will settle (is that the right word  even though they didn't state that themselves?) and marry each other. Julianne receives a call/voice mail out of the bluecoincidently enough, close to the birthday of said agefrom Michael. Immediately, she thinks it's a proposal. Close enough: he's announcing his (quick) engagement to Kim (Cameron Diaz) and he wants Julianne to be there for him. While thrust into the wedding arrangements and "best man's role," she plots to apply a large wedge between the happy couple in order to get Michael all to herself, despite her own spiritual conscience and a physical one, in the form of her (other best) friend, George (Rupert Everett) and his constant pleas for her to do the right thing: be honest with him and let the happy couple marry. The movie is both extremely humorous and deep. It's heartfelt and real, while delivering fantastic one-liners with a great soundtrack. It could literally happen, and probably does  again, I'm proof. Okay, mine dealt with a best friend of mine that I was in love with for many years. Though we "acted" upon it multiple times  and I am surely downplaying that, my half of the relationship was built on pure love. Unfortunately, not only was the feelings not reciprocated, but I was told constantly, despite the repetitiveness of the actions, that this was anything but unemotional. I saw a lot in Julianne that I saw within myself. Hers, thankfully, ended in a weekend per the movie's timeline. Miserably, mine lasted seven years. Enough about me. Suffice to say, I KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING THRU. And beyond that, the movie lifts me up, makes me laugh and definitely makes me cry  each and every time I see it. It's both lighthearted and deep. It has fantastic scenes individually and on a whole  such as the singing group, led by a wonderful Rupert Everett for "I Say A Little Prayer." It's one of my all-time favorite films and soundtracks. Ever been through this? Have you ever loved someone so much it hurt? Physically? Ever act on it, even though you know that was the wrong course? WATCH this movie. Live it. Love it. And watch one of the most realistic endings Hollywood has ever produced. It may not be the finale you were looking for, but it's the most honest.

    This movie was very cute and had a lot of funny little parts in it. It has Julie Roberts AND Cameron Diaz so who could go wrong? Good acting and storyline. The gentlemen in the movie are also charming and handsome. It has some heartwarming parts and other parts of suspense and comedy. A must see for the romantic at heart. I always imagine Julie Roberts as sweet and innocent and although "adorable" as always in this movie, she plays a somewhat jealous and sneaky "best friend" who tries to ruin the wedding because she hasn't ever had the courage to tell her best friend she is in love with him. Is she truly in love or is she just suffering doubts about her feelings for her long time friend? We may never know. I think she's a lucky lady either way her heart is turned because she has TWO handsome male best friends in this movie! That's another cute thing about this movie... to see two strong male roles that are not vulgar or hostile towards women but romantic and supportive. A refreshing change from some other stereotypical male roles we see a lot of these days. Cool movie.. I give it an 8/10!

    This was one movie ending that we thoroughly agreed with - and not because the couple got together, but because they didn't. Jules Potter is way too selfish to be in a relationship with anyone. Jules and Michael have been friends since college, and one year they made a pact that if neither of them were married by the time they were 28 (really? Did they go to school in Utah?) they would marry each other. When Michael calls on the eve (eve eve) of Jules' birthday she assumes it's to call in his marker. When she finds out that he is instead calling to announce that he's engaged to someone else, Jules suddenly decides that he's the one for her, and spends the next three days doing everything in her power to break up the clearly happy couple. Talk about wanting what you can't have. Jules doesn't want to win Michael over; she just wants to win. Is this really how you treat your best friend? Clearly not, as Jules doesn't win the guy in the end after all. Three days of sabotage - flirting, prancing about in her underwear, trying to provoke Michael's jealousy by pretending to be engaged to her best gay friend George, attempting to humiliate Kimmy, the bride-to-be, in a karaoke bar, sending manipulative emails from Kimmy's father, and finally - confessing her newly discovered "love" for Michael and forcing her lips on him - are all done in vain. Just when you're wondering how much farther she'll take it, Jules finally comes to the realization that Michael's love for Kimmy cannot be swayed by her cheap antics. And in the end it's Michael and Kimmy who get married and sail off into the sunset. We shudder to think what happens when George announces he's met someone. Will she prance around him in Gucci couture? Move to Chelsea? Have a sex change operation? We think Michael, Kimmy and George need to find some new friends. www.reel-couples.com

    It came to 27-year-old New York restaurant critic Julianne Potter's (Julia Roberts) attention when she was having a meal with her gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett). Longtime friend Michael O'Neil had called her to say that he is going to get married in four days' time, to Kimberley Wallace (Cameron Diaz), who is a University of Chicago student from a wealthy family. It upsets Julianne, knowing that back in college, he and Michael had made an agreement that if they were not married by the time they reach 28, they will marry each other. But not only that, Michael had only known the 20-year-old Kimberley for a short period of time. Julianne realises that she is in love with her longtime friend and set out to prevent the wedding from taking place. While at the same time, to be Kimberley's maid of honour. It sets off a series of comical sequences like taking Kimberley and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimberley is a terrible singer and asking the gay friend George to pretend that they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous of Julianne. Unfortunately the plans did not work. George then advised Julianne to do the obvious: Tell Michael up front that she is in love with him. So on the morning of the wedding, Julianne finally confessed her true feelings to her longtime friend, asked him to marry her instead, and kisses him. Kimberley unfortunately saw it all and ran off with Michael chasing her, and Julianne chases him unsuccessfully...or so she thought. She spotted Michael at the train station and finally accepted the fact that she has lost Michael to Kimberley. She went to apologise to Kimberley and explained the whole situation, including that he did not kissed her back. The wedding did took place after all, with Julianne as Kimberley's maid of honour wishing them well. And she being consoled by George as well. To have Julia Roberts playing the role of the person to steal her friend's future spouse may be just wrong given one does not associate her in that kind of role, but one probably cannot help but wonder whether she can do it in the end. Whether one was rooting for Julia Roberts in her role as Julianne or not, there is also other reasons to like this film. Like the supporting cast especially Rupert Everett as George.

    I'm horribly shocked that this film is considered a romantic comedy, let alone one with many positive reviews. Whoever wrote the script and plot for this film should be shot. Seriously, how does Roberts losing the man she love in the end make it a romantic comedy worth seeing? And while the general consensus was that she was 'evil' and 'selfish', Jules struck me as more love-silly and desperate than evil and conniving (if any staunch negativity from Roberts part was intended then it wasn't well-acted at all). Roberts' character and the opposing guy both showed flaws and imperfections, but such is often the case with troubled people trying to sort out their real feelings in order to make the best relationship decision(s). Also, up until the end her friend acted as if he was secretly in love with her as well so the ending, aside from utterly depressing, didn't really make sense (unless that was also poor acting). That being said, this film would've been much better if they ended up together.

    Although it is perhaps most well-known for its unconventional ending, My Best Friend's Wedding should be known, for its perfect blend of romance and comedy, as the definitive rom-com. Julianne Potter (Roberts) is a New York food critic, who, after receiving a mysterious voicemail from her former lover and long-time best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney), realizes her affection for him. Unfortunately for her, upon returning Michael's call, Julianne learns that the new-found man of her dreams has himself met someone and intends to marry her within four days. Unaware of Julianne's recently acquired feelings for him, Michael insists that she join the wedding party in Chicago and support him in his hour of need. After some goading from her other best friend, George (Rupert Everett), Julianne decides to go in the hope of breaking up the couple before they can say their "I dos." The ensuing madness is both enchanting and hilarious, as Julianne finds herself being continually and innocuously bested by Michael's fianc&eacute;, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), resulting in a series of hilariously irate phone calls to George, who always happens to field them at the worst possible times (i.e. his entire family gets an earful from the answering machine over dinner.) Diaz and Roberts are perfect comedic matches for one another as the innocently saccharine fianc&eacute; and the plotting best friend, and Mulroney is so suave and sexy as "the man of our dreams" (as Roberts puts it) that it's incredible more of the film's female population aren't fighting for his affection. Everett is equally well cast in the role of George, the gay best friend who plays it straight at one point for Julianne's sake. His scenes provide some of the film's funniest moments, particularly when George teasingly embarrasses Julianne in front of the rest of the wedding party by launching into his rendition of "I'll Say a Little Prayer (For You)." Aside from just its comedy, which is considerable, and its romance, which is unorthodox, "My Best Friend's Wedding" succeeds because its characters are fully-formed, dimensional beings who live in a very real world. Julianne, with all of her charm and charisma, is really just a desperate, wavering soul who fears what might happen if everyone finds happiness besides her. Kimmy, instead of being flat and static (as the "other" girl is wont to be in a romantic comedy), is a likable and endearing character that the audience can empathize with. Michael, however, is perhaps the most fascinating character of them all. Michael is both the perfect best friend- teasing and adoring, while never crossing the line- and the perfect boyfriend. He balances his affection for both of the women in his life and draws his own line regarding the ways in which he can love each of them. His decisions and character both break the traditional mold of a romantic comedy's "dream guy" by injecting a measure of reality and at the same time uphold it, by demonstrating that there is a way in which a strong, selfless, and moral man can exist without becoming a mere fantasy.

    This was one movie ending that we thoroughly agreed with - and not because the couple got together, but because they didn't. Jules Potter is way too selfish to be in a relationship with anyone. Jules and Michael have been friends since college, and one year they made a pact that if neither of them were married by the time they were 28 (really? Did they go to school in Utah?) they would marry each other. When Michael calls on the eve (eve eve) of Jules' birthday she assumes it's to call in his marker. When she finds out that he is instead calling to announce that he's engaged to someone else, Jules suddenly decides that he's the one for her, and spends the next three days doing everything in her power to break up the clearly happy couple. Talk about wanting what you can't have. Jules doesn't want to win Michael over; she just wants to win. Is this really how you treat your best friend? Clearly not, as Jules doesn't win the guy in the end after all. Three days of sabotage - flirting, prancing about in her underwear, trying to provoke Michael's jealousy by pretending to be engaged to her best gay friend George, attempting to humiliate Kimmy, the bride-to-be, in a karaoke bar, sending manipulative emails from Kimmy's father, and finally - confessing her newly discovered "love" for Michael and forcing her lips on him - are all done in vain. Just when you're wondering how much farther she'll take it, Jules finally comes to the realization that Michael's love for Kimmy cannot be swayed by her cheap antics. And in the end it's Michael and Kimmy who get married and sail off into the sunset. We shudder to think what happens when George announces he's met someone. Will she prance around him in Gucci couture? Move to Chelsea? Have a sex change operation? We think Michael, Kimmy and George need to find some new friends. www.reel-couples.com

    It came to 27-year-old New York restaurant critic Julianne Potter's (Julia Roberts) attention when she was having a meal with her gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett). Longtime friend Michael O'Neil had called her to say that he is going to get married in four days' time, to Kimberley Wallace (Cameron Diaz), who is a University of Chicago student from a wealthy family. It upsets Julianne, knowing that back in college, he and Michael had made an agreement that if they were not married by the time they reach 28, they will marry each other. But not only that, Michael had only known the 20-year-old Kimberley for a short period of time. Julianne realises that she is in love with her longtime friend and set out to prevent the wedding from taking place. While at the same time, to be Kimberley's maid of honour. It sets off a series of comical sequences like taking Kimberley and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimberley is a terrible singer and asking the gay friend George to pretend that they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous of Julianne. Unfortunately the plans did not work. George then advised Julianne to do the obvious: Tell Michael up front that she is in love with him. So on the morning of the wedding, Julianne finally confessed her true feelings to her longtime friend, asked him to marry her instead, and kisses him. Kimberley unfortunately saw it all and ran off with Michael chasing her, and Julianne chases him unsuccessfully...or so she thought. She spotted Michael at the train station and finally accepted the fact that she has lost Michael to Kimberley. She went to apologise to Kimberley and explained the whole situation, including that he did not kissed her back. The wedding did took place after all, with Julianne as Kimberley's maid of honour wishing them well. And she being consoled by George as well. To have Julia Roberts playing the role of the person to steal her friend's future spouse may be just wrong given one does not associate her in that kind of role, but one probably cannot help but wonder whether she can do it in the end. Whether one was rooting for Julia Roberts in her role as Julianne or not, there is also other reasons to like this film. Like the supporting cast especially Rupert Everett as George.

    I'm horribly shocked that this film is considered a romantic comedy, let alone one with many positive reviews. Whoever wrote the script and plot for this film should be shot. Seriously, how does Roberts losing the man she love in the end make it a romantic comedy worth seeing? And while the general consensus was that she was 'evil' and 'selfish', Jules struck me as more love-silly and desperate than evil and conniving (if any staunch negativity from Roberts part was intended then it wasn't well-acted at all). Roberts' character and the opposing guy both showed flaws and imperfections, but such is often the case with troubled people trying to sort out their real feelings in order to make the best relationship decision(s). Also, up until the end her friend acted as if he was secretly in love with her as well so the ending, aside from utterly depressing, didn't really make sense (unless that was also poor acting). That being said, this film would've been much better if they ended up together.

    Although it is perhaps most well-known for its unconventional ending, My Best Friend's Wedding should be known, for its perfect blend of romance and comedy, as the definitive rom-com. Julianne Potter (Roberts) is a New York food critic, who, after receiving a mysterious voicemail from her former lover and long-time best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney), realizes her affection for him. Unfortunately for her, upon returning Michael's call, Julianne learns that the new-found man of her dreams has himself met someone and intends to marry her within four days. Unaware of Julianne's recently acquired feelings for him, Michael insists that she join the wedding party in Chicago and support him in his hour of need. After some goading from her other best friend, George (Rupert Everett), Julianne decides to go in the hope of breaking up the couple before they can say their "I dos." The ensuing madness is both enchanting and hilarious, as Julianne finds herself being continually and innocuously bested by Michael's fianc&eacute;, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), resulting in a series of hilariously irate phone calls to George, who always happens to field them at the worst possible times (i.e. his entire family gets an earful from the answering machine over dinner.) Diaz and Roberts are perfect comedic matches for one another as the innocently saccharine fianc&eacute; and the plotting best friend, and Mulroney is so suave and sexy as "the man of our dreams" (as Roberts puts it) that it's incredible more of the film's female population aren't fighting for his affection. Everett is equally well cast in the role of George, the gay best friend who plays it straight at one point for Julianne's sake. His scenes provide some of the film's funniest moments, particularly when George teasingly embarrasses Julianne in front of the rest of the wedding party by launching into his rendition of "I'll Say a Little Prayer (For You)." Aside from just its comedy, which is considerable, and its romance, which is unorthodox, "My Best Friend's Wedding" succeeds because its characters are fully-formed, dimensional beings who live in a very real world. Julianne, with all of her charm and charisma, is really just a desperate, wavering soul who fears what might happen if everyone finds happiness besides her. Kimmy, instead of being flat and static (as the "other" girl is wont to be in a romantic comedy), is a likable and endearing character that the audience can empathize with. Michael, however, is perhaps the most fascinating character of them all. Michael is both the perfect best friend- teasing and adoring, while never crossing the line- and the perfect boyfriend. He balances his affection for both of the women in his life and draws his own line regarding the ways in which he can love each of them. His decisions and character both break the traditional mold of a romantic comedy's "dream guy" by injecting a measure of reality and at the same time uphold it, by demonstrating that there is a way in which a strong, selfless, and moral man can exist without becoming a mere fantasy.

    My Best Friend's Wedding is a film that stars Julia Roberts.A woman realizes that friends can be lovers, but now has to convince the friend in question in this romantic comedy.Cameron Diaz, Dermot Mulroney, Rupert Everett, and Philip Bosco co-star to play key supporting roles.It was directed by P. J. Hogan. Michael and Julianne were romantically involved in college, and after breaking up, they have managed to remain close friends. For years, they have had a pledge that if both were single when they turned 28, they would get married. Shortly before her 28th birthday, Julianne is lamenting the sad state of her love life when she gets a call from Michael, who announces that he has important news. Julianne is convinced that Michael is going to ask her to marry him, and she is crestfallen when he announces that he's engaged to Kimmy Wallace. Kimmy seems like the perfect woman for Michael because she's sweet, pretty, bright, and adores Michael, and her wealthy family is just as fond of him as she is. But now that Julianne has realized how much she loves Michael, she's not about to give him up without a fight and isn't afraid to fight dirty. Julianne's uneasy ally in the battle for Michael's affections is her friend and editor George Downes, a cheerfully out-of-the-closet homosexual who is not prepared when Julianne asks him to pose as her boyfriend. One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990's, My Best Friend's Wedding not only gave Julia Roberts a delightful vehicle for her crowd- pleasing comeback, but it further distinguished itself by avoiding the conventional plotting of the genre.Thanks to her charming performance and a subversive spin on the genre, this movie is a refreshingly entertaining.Rupert Everett scored rave reviews for his scene-stealing performance as Robert's gay friend who goes along with her scheming, and even as she makes her character's needy desperation disarmingly appealing, Roberts wisely allows Diaz to capitalize on her charming time in the spotlight. As the romantic outcome remains uncertain, the viewer is held in a state of giddy suspense, and director Hogan pulls off some hilarious scenes that could easily have fallen flat in the hands of a less talented filmmaker.Also, Hogan does manage to make his attractive leads look like complete idiots, no mean achievement in image-obsessed Hollywood.No wonder it happens to be the second most popular film of Roberts after Pretty Woman.

    From what I've read here on IMDb this one split the vote straight down the middle, seems you either love it or loathe it. I found a lot to admire and little to dislike. It comes out of a long tradition that dates back to the earliest talkies; attractive, affluent people, living in luxurious apartments/houses, wearing expensive clothes, dining in expensive restaurants and generally being charming and romantic. We've been there with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, Grant and Katherine Hepburn, Grant and Ingrid Bergman, Fred and Ginger, Claudette Colbert, Audrey Hepburn, Franchot Tone, Bill Holden, Doris Day, Rock Hudson and now the new generation, epitomized here by Julia Roberts. The story is relatively unimportant, all we ask is twelve reels of escapism, a set piece or two, a song or two, lots of laughter balanced by the odd tear, a souffl&eacute;' that segues into a lemon mousse and sends us out into the night with a smile on our face and warmth in our heart. This one delivers as well as any and better than most.

    nice, sweet, intelligent, seductive comedy. sure, not great but perfect for be more than a new pink story. Rupert Everett is perfect key for tale, Julia Roberts is perfect choice for ex girl friend but the axis, the top and the heart of film is Cameron Diaz in one of her best roles. it is a good film because it is excellent puzzle. love, hate, humor, vulnerability, the bitch, the innocent young woman, the naive lover and slices of meetings are directed with precise and full of grace art. so, it is a comedy and little more. picture of choices and shadows of past, subtle nuances of dialogs and a wise cast are central pieces of a build in which all is basket of crumbs from a hided Shakespeare.

    Granted, I should never have walked into this one but it was Tight-arse Tuesday so I wasn't fussy. The musical piece at the restaurant was nicely done, but I refuse to believe that the lead man would pass up on a smart, pretty Julia Roberts then commit to an annoying blonde whose beauty is not even skin deep (Diaz looked fantastic in The Mask but she must have been wearing one at the time). I soldiered on thru the obvious cigarette ad in the hallway, but as the wedding approached, i honestly didn't care who did what. Amazingly, my mate felt exactly the same and we walked out after nothing more than a nod and a wink. No spoilers here: I still don't know the ending..

    How true was My Best Friend's Wedding? Well, I've lived it, and yes, I was the bad guy. Sure, I didn't sabotage a wedding, nor someone's life. But, I didn't partake in a lot of the jealousy and plots she did, sadly enough. So, I'm neither proud or ashamed of what I did in my own existence, I can safely say, what she did in this fantastic movie, was true-to-life. Let's get the synopsis out of the way: non-committal Julianne (Julia Roberts) has a best (male) friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) she once dated and they made a pack: if neither is married by a certain age, then they will settle (is that the right word  even though they didn't state that themselves?) and marry each other. Julianne receives a call/voice mail out of the bluecoincidently enough, close to the birthday of said agefrom Michael. Immediately, she thinks it's a proposal. Close enough: he's announcing his (quick) engagement to Kim (Cameron Diaz) and he wants Julianne to be there for him. While thrust into the wedding arrangements and "best man's role," she plots to apply a large wedge between the happy couple in order to get Michael all to herself, despite her own spiritual conscience and a physical one, in the form of her (other best) friend, George (Rupert Everett) and his constant pleas for her to do the right thing: be honest with him and let the happy couple marry. The movie is both extremely humorous and deep. It's heartfelt and real, while delivering fantastic one-liners with a great soundtrack. It could literally happen, and probably does  again, I'm proof. Okay, mine dealt with a best friend of mine that I was in love with for many years. Though we "acted" upon it multiple times  and I am surely downplaying that, my half of the relationship was built on pure love. Unfortunately, not only was the feelings not reciprocated, but I was told constantly, despite the repetitiveness of the actions, that this was anything but unemotional. I saw a lot in Julianne that I saw within myself. Hers, thankfully, ended in a weekend per the movie's timeline. Miserably, mine lasted seven years. Enough about me. Suffice to say, I KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING THRU. And beyond that, the movie lifts me up, makes me laugh and definitely makes me cry  each and every time I see it. It's both lighthearted and deep. It has fantastic scenes individually and on a whole  such as the singing group, led by a wonderful Rupert Everett for "I Say A Little Prayer." It's one of my all-time favorite films and soundtracks. Ever been through this? Have you ever loved someone so much it hurt? Physically? Ever act on it, even though you know that was the wrong course? WATCH this movie. Live it. Love it. And watch one of the most realistic endings Hollywood has ever produced. It may not be the finale you were looking for, but it's the most honest.

    This movie was very cute and had a lot of funny little parts in it. It has Julie Roberts AND Cameron Diaz so who could go wrong? Good acting and storyline. The gentlemen in the movie are also charming and handsome. It has some heartwarming parts and other parts of suspense and comedy. A must see for the romantic at heart. I always imagine Julie Roberts as sweet and innocent and although "adorable" as always in this movie, she plays a somewhat jealous and sneaky "best friend" who tries to ruin the wedding because she hasn't ever had the courage to tell her best friend she is in love with him. Is she truly in love or is she just suffering doubts about her feelings for her long time friend? We may never know. I think she's a lucky lady either way her heart is turned because she has TWO handsome male best friends in this movie! That's another cute thing about this movie... to see two strong male roles that are not vulgar or hostile towards women but romantic and supportive. A refreshing change from some other stereotypical male roles we see a lot of these days. Cool movie.. I give it an 8/10!

This one delivers as well as any and better than most.

    nice, sweet, intelligent, seductive comedy. sure, not great but perfect for be more than a new pink story. Rupert Everett is perfect key for tale, Julia Roberts is perfect choice for ex girl friend but the axis, the top and the heart of film is Cameron Diaz in one of her best roles. it is a good film because it is excellent puzzle. love, hate, humor, vulnerability, the bitch, the innocent young woman, the naive lover and slices of meetings are directed with precise and full of grace art. so, it is a comedy and little more. picture of choices and shadows of past, subtle nuances of dialogs and a wise cast are central pieces of a build in which all is basket of crumbs from a hided Shakespeare.

    Granted, I should never have walked into this one but it was Tight-arse Tuesday so I wasn't fussy. The musical piece at the restaurant was nicely done, but I refuse to believe that the lead man would pass up on a smart, pretty Julia Roberts then commit to an annoying blonde whose beauty is not even skin deep (Diaz looked fantastic in The Mask but she must have been wearing one at the time). I soldiered on thru the obvious cigarette ad in the hallway, but as the wedding approached, i honestly didn't care who did what. Amazingly, my mate felt exactly the same and we walked out after nothing more than a nod and a wink. No spoilers here: I still don't know the ending..

    How true was My Best Friend's Wedding? Well, I've lived it, and yes, I was the bad guy. Sure, I didn't sabotage a wedding, nor someone's life. But, I didn't partake in a lot of the jealousy and plots she did, sadly enough. So, I'm neither proud or ashamed of what I did in my own existence, I can safely say, what she did in this fantastic movie, was true-to-life. Let's get the synopsis out of the way: non-committal Julianne (Julia Roberts) has a best (male) friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) she once dated and they made a pack: if neither is married by a certain age, then they will settle (is that the right word  even though they didn't state that themselves?) and marry each other. Julianne receives a call/voice mail out of the bluecoincidently enough, close to the birthday of said agefrom Michael. Immediately, she thinks it's a proposal. Close enough: he's announcing his (quick) engagement to Kim (Cameron Diaz) and he wants Julianne to be there for him. While thrust into the wedding arrangements and "best man's role," she plots to apply a large wedge between the happy couple in order to get Michael all to herself, despite her own spiritual conscience and a physical one, in the form of her (other best) friend, George (Rupert Everett) and his constant pleas for her to do the right thing: be honest with him and let the happy couple marry. The movie is both extremely humorous and deep. It's heartfelt and real, while delivering fantastic one-liners with a great soundtrack. It could literally happen, and probably does  again, I'm proof. Okay, mine dealt with a best friend of mine that I was in love with for many years. Though we "acted" upon it multiple times  and I am surely downplaying that, my half of the relationship was built on pure love. Unfortunately, not only was the feelings not reciprocated, but I was told constantly, despite the repetitiveness of the actions, that this was anything but unemotional. I saw a lot in Julianne that I saw within myself. Hers, thankfully, ended in a weekend per the movie's timeline. Miserably, mine lasted seven years. Enough about me. Suffice to say, I KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING THRU. And beyond that, the movie lifts me up, makes me laugh and definitely makes me cry  each and every time I see it. It's both lighthearted and deep. It has fantastic scenes individually and on a whole  such as the singing group, led by a wonderful Rupert Everett for "I Say A Little Prayer." It's one of my all-time favorite films and soundtracks. Ever been through this? Have you ever loved someone so much it hurt? Physically? Ever act on it, even though you know that was the wrong course? WATCH this movie. Live it. Love it. And watch one of the most realistic endings Hollywood has ever produced. It may not be the finale you were looking for, but it's the most honest.

    This movie was very cute and had a lot of funny little parts in it. It has Julie Roberts AND Cameron Diaz so who could go wrong? Good acting and storyline. The gentlemen in the movie are also charming and handsome. It has some heartwarming parts and other parts of suspense and comedy. A must see for the romantic at heart. I always imagine Julie Roberts as sweet and innocent and although "adorable" as always in this movie, she plays a somewhat jealous and sneaky "best friend" who tries to ruin the wedding because she hasn't ever had the courage to tell her best friend she is in love with him. Is she truly in love or is she just suffering doubts about her feelings for her long time friend? We may never know. I think she's a lucky lady either way her heart is turned because she has TWO handsome male best friends in this movie! That's another cute thing about this movie... to see two strong male roles that are not vulgar or hostile towards women but romantic and supportive. A refreshing change from some other stereotypical male roles we see a lot of these days. Cool movie.. I give it an 8/10!

    This was one movie ending that we thoroughly agreed with - and not because the couple got together, but because they didn't. Jules Potter is way too selfish to be in a relationship with anyone. Jules and Michael have been friends since college, and one year they made a pact that if neither of them were married by the time they were 28 (really? Did they go to school in Utah?) they would marry each other. When Michael calls on the eve (eve eve) of Jules' birthday she assumes it's to call in his marker. When she finds out that he is instead calling to announce that he's engaged to someone else, Jules suddenly decides that he's the one for her, and spends the next three days doing everything in her power to break up the clearly happy couple. Talk about wanting what you can't have. Jules doesn't want to win Michael over; she just wants to win. Is this really how you treat your best friend? Clearly not, as Jules doesn't win the guy in the end after all. Three days of sabotage - flirting, prancing about in her underwear, trying to provoke Michael's jealousy by pretending to be engaged to her best gay friend George, attempting to humiliate Kimmy, the bride-to-be, in a karaoke bar, sending manipulative emails from Kimmy's father, and finally - confessing her newly discovered "love" for Michael and forcing her lips on him - are all done in vain. Just when you're wondering how much farther she'll take it, Jules finally comes to the realization that Michael's love for Kimmy cannot be swayed by her cheap antics. And in the end it's Michael and Kimmy who get married and sail off into the sunset. We shudder to think what happens when George announces he's met someone. Will she prance around him in Gucci couture? Move to Chelsea? Have a sex change operation? We think Michael, Kimmy and George need to find some new friends. www.reel-couples.com

    It came to 27-year-old New York restaurant critic Julianne Potter's (Julia Roberts) attention when she was having a meal with her gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett). Longtime friend Michael O'Neil had called her to say that he is going to get married in four days' time, to Kimberley Wallace (Cameron Diaz), who is a University of Chicago student from a wealthy family. It upsets Julianne, knowing that back in college, he and Michael had made an agreement that if they were not married by the time they reach 28, they will marry each other. But not only that, Michael had only known the 20-year-old Kimberley for a short period of time. Julianne realises that she is in love with her longtime friend and set out to prevent the wedding from taking place. While at the same time, to be Kimberley's maid of honour. It sets off a series of comical sequences like taking Kimberley and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimberley is a terrible singer and asking the gay friend George to pretend that they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous of Julianne. Unfortunately the plans did not work. George then advised Julianne to do the obvious: Tell Michael up front that she is in love with him. So on the morning of the wedding, Julianne finally confessed her true feelings to her longtime friend, asked him to marry her instead, and kisses him. Kimberley unfortunately saw it all and ran off with Michael chasing her, and Julianne chases him unsuccessfully...or so she thought. She spotted Michael at the train station and finally accepted the fact that she has lost Michael to Kimberley. She went to apologise to Kimberley and explained the whole situation, including that he did not kissed her back. The wedding did took place after all, with Julianne as Kimberley's maid of honour wishing them well. And she being consoled by George as well. To have Julia Roberts playing the role of the person to steal her friend's future spouse may be just wrong given one does not associate her in that kind of role, but one probably cannot help but wonder whether she can do it in the end. Whether one was rooting for Julia Roberts in her role as Julianne or not, there is also other reasons to like this film. Like the supporting cast especially Rupert Everett as George.

    I'm horribly shocked that this film is considered a romantic comedy, let alone one with many positive reviews. Whoever wrote the script and plot for this film should be shot. Seriously, how does Roberts losing the man she love in the end make it a romantic comedy worth seeing? And while the general consensus was that she was 'evil' and 'selfish', Jules struck me as more love-silly and desperate than evil and conniving (if any staunch negativity from Roberts part was intended then it wasn't well-acted at all). Roberts' character and the opposing guy both showed flaws and imperfections, but such is often the case with troubled people trying to sort out their real feelings in order to make the best relationship decision(s). Also, up until the end her friend acted as if he was secretly in love with her as well so the ending, aside from utterly depressing, didn't really make sense (unless that was also poor acting). That being said, this film would've been much better if they ended up together.

    Although it is perhaps most well-known for its unconventional ending, My Best Friend's Wedding should be known, for its perfect blend of romance and comedy, as the definitive rom-com. Julianne Potter (Roberts) is a New York food critic, who, after receiving a mysterious voicemail from her former lover and long-time best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney), realizes her affection for him. Unfortunately for her, upon returning Michael's call, Julianne learns that the new-found man of her dreams has himself met someone and intends to marry her within four days. Unaware of Julianne's recently acquired feelings for him, Michael insists that she join the wedding party in Chicago and support him in his hour of need. After some goading from her other best friend, George (Rupert Everett), Julianne decides to go in the hope of breaking up the couple before they can say their "I dos." The ensuing madness is both enchanting and hilarious, as Julianne finds herself being continually and innocuously bested by Michael's fianc&eacute;, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), resulting in a series of hilariously irate phone calls to George, who always happens to field them at the worst possible times (i.e. his entire family gets an earful from the answering machine over dinner.) Diaz and Roberts are perfect comedic matches for one another as the innocently saccharine fianc&eacute; and the plotting best friend, and Mulroney is so suave and sexy as "the man of our dreams" (as Roberts puts it) that it's incredible more of the film's female population aren't fighting for his affection. Everett is equally well cast in the role of George, the gay best friend who plays it straight at one point for Julianne's sake. His scenes provide some of the film's funniest moments, particularly when George teasingly embarrasses Julianne in front of the rest of the wedding party by launching into his rendition of "I'll Say a Little Prayer (For You)." Aside from just its comedy, which is considerable, and its romance, which is unorthodox, "My Best Friend's Wedding" succeeds because its characters are fully-formed, dimensional beings who live in a very real world. Julianne, with all of her charm and charisma, is really just a desperate, wavering soul who fears what might happen if everyone finds happiness besides her. Kimmy, instead of being flat and static (as the "other" girl is wont to be in a romantic comedy), is a likable and endearing character that the audience can empathize with. Michael, however, is perhaps the most fascinating character of them all. Michael is both the perfect best friend- teasing and adoring, while never crossing the line- and the perfect boyfriend. He balances his affection for both of the women in his life and draws his own line regarding the ways in which he can love each of them. His decisions and character both break the traditional mold of a romantic comedy's "dream guy" by injecting a measure of reality and at the same time uphold it, by demonstrating that there is a way in which a strong, selfless, and moral man can exist without becoming a mere fantasy.

    My Best Friend's Wedding is a film that stars Julia Roberts.A woman realizes that friends can be lovers, but now has to convince the friend in question in this romantic comedy.Cameron Diaz, Dermot Mulroney, Rupert Everett, and Philip Bosco co-star to play key supporting roles.It was directed by P. J. Hogan. Michael and Julianne were romantically involved in college, and after breaking up, they have managed to remain close friends. For years, they have had a pledge that if both were single when they turned 28, they would get married. Shortly before her 28th birthday, Julianne is lamenting the sad state of her love life when she gets a call from Michael, who announces that he has important news. Julianne is convinced that Michael is going to ask her to marry him, and she is crestfallen when he announces that he's engaged to Kimmy Wallace. Kimmy seems like the perfect woman for Michael because she's sweet, pretty, bright, and adores Michael, and her wealthy family is just as fond of him as she is. But now that Julianne has realized how much she loves Michael, she's not about to give him up without a fight and isn't afraid to fight dirty. Julianne's uneasy ally in the battle for Michael's affections is her friend and editor George Downes, a cheerfully out-of-the-closet homosexual who is not prepared when Julianne asks him to pose as her boyfriend. One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990's, My Best Friend's Wedding not only gave Julia Roberts a delightful vehicle for her crowd- pleasing comeback, but it further distinguished itself by avoiding the conventional plotting of the genre.Thanks to her charming performance and a subversive spin on the genre, this movie is a refreshingly entertaining.Rupert Everett scored rave reviews for his scene-stealing performance as Robert's gay friend who goes along with her scheming, and even as she makes her character's needy desperation disarmingly appealing, Roberts wisely allows Diaz to capitalize on her charming time in the spotlight. As the romantic outcome remains uncertain, the viewer is held in a state of giddy suspense, and director Hogan pulls off some hilarious scenes that could easily have fallen flat in the hands of a less talented filmmaker.Also, Hogan does manage to make his attractive leads look like complete idiots, no mean achievement in image-obsessed Hollywood.No wonder it happens to be the second most popular film of Roberts after Pretty Woman.

    From what I've read here on IMDb this one split the vote straight down the middle, seems you either love it or loathe it. I found a lot to admire and little to dislike. It comes out of a long tradition that dates back to the earliest talkies; attractive, affluent people, living in luxurious apartments/houses, wearing expensive clothes, dining in expensive restaurants and generally being charming and romantic. We've been there with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, Grant and Katherine Hepburn, Grant and Ingrid Bergman, Fred and Ginger, Claudette Colbert, Audrey Hepburn, Franchot Tone, Bill Holden, Doris Day, Rock Hudson and now the new generation, epitomized here by Julia Roberts. The story is relatively unimportant, all we ask is twelve reels of escapism, a set piece or two, a song or two, lots of laughter balanced by the odd tear, a souffl&eacute;' that segues into a lemon mousse and sends us out into the night with a smile on our face and warmth in our heart.

And while the general consensus was that she was 'evil' and 'selfish', Jules struck me as more love-silly and desperate than evil and conniving (if any staunch negativity from Roberts part was intended then it wasn't well-acted at all). Roberts' character and the opposing guy both showed flaws and imperfections, but such is often the case with troubled people trying to sort out their real feelings in order to make the best relationship decision(s). Also, up until the end her friend acted as if he was secretly in love with her as well so the ending, aside from utterly depressing, didn't really make sense (unless that was also poor acting). That being said, this film would've been much better if they ended up together.

    Although it is perhaps most well-known for its unconventional ending, My Best Friend's Wedding should be known, for its perfect blend of romance and comedy, as the definitive rom-com. Julianne Potter (Roberts) is a New York food critic, who, after receiving a mysterious voicemail from her former lover and long-time best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney), realizes her affection for him. Unfortunately for her, upon returning Michael's call, Julianne learns that the new-found man of her dreams has himself met someone and intends to marry her within four days. Unaware of Julianne's recently acquired feelings for him, Michael insists that she join the wedding party in Chicago and support him in his hour of need. After some goading from her other best friend, George (Rupert Everett), Julianne decides to go in the hope of breaking up the couple before they can say their "I dos." The ensuing madness is both enchanting and hilarious, as Julianne finds herself being continually and innocuously bested by Michael's fianc&eacute;, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), resulting in a series of hilariously irate phone calls to George, who always happens to field them at the worst possible times (i.e. his entire family gets an earful from the answering machine over dinner.) Diaz and Roberts are perfect comedic matches for one another as the innocently saccharine fianc&eacute; and the plotting best friend, and Mulroney is so suave and sexy as "the man of our dreams" (as Roberts puts it) that it's incredible more of the film's female population aren't fighting for his affection. Everett is equally well cast in the role of George, the gay best friend who plays it straight at one point for Julianne's sake. His scenes provide some of the film's funniest moments, particularly when George teasingly embarrasses Julianne in front of the rest of the wedding party by launching into his rendition of "I'll Say a Little Prayer (For You)." Aside from just its comedy, which is considerable, and its romance, which is unorthodox, "My Best Friend's Wedding" succeeds because its characters are fully-formed, dimensional beings who live in a very real world. Julianne, with all of her charm and charisma, is really just a desperate, wavering soul who fears what might happen if everyone finds happiness besides her. Kimmy, instead of being flat and static (as the "other" girl is wont to be in a romantic comedy), is a likable and endearing character that the audience can empathize with. Michael, however, is perhaps the most fascinating character of them all. Michael is both the perfect best friend- teasing and adoring, while never crossing the line- and the perfect boyfriend. He balances his affection for both of the women in his life and draws his own line regarding the ways in which he can love each of them. His decisions and character both break the traditional mold of a romantic comedy's "dream guy" by injecting a measure of reality and at the same time uphold it, by demonstrating that there is a way in which a strong, selfless, and moral man can exist without becoming a mere fantasy.

    My Best Friend's Wedding is a film that stars Julia Roberts.A woman realizes that friends can be lovers, but now has to convince the friend in question in this romantic comedy.Cameron Diaz, Dermot Mulroney, Rupert Everett, and Philip Bosco co-star to play key supporting roles.It was directed by P. J. Hogan. Michael and Julianne were romantically involved in college, and after breaking up, they have managed to remain close friends. For years, they have had a pledge that if both were single when they turned 28, they would get married. Shortly before her 28th birthday, Julianne is lamenting the sad state of her love life when she gets a call from Michael, who announces that he has important news. Julianne is convinced that Michael is going to ask her to marry him, and she is crestfallen when he announces that he's engaged to Kimmy Wallace. Kimmy seems like the perfect woman for Michael because she's sweet, pretty, bright, and adores Michael, and her wealthy family is just as fond of him as she is. But now that Julianne has realized how much she loves Michael, she's not about to give him up without a fight and isn't afraid to fight dirty. Julianne's uneasy ally in the battle for Michael's affections is her friend and editor George Downes, a cheerfully out-of-the-closet homosexual who is not prepared when Julianne asks him to pose as her boyfriend. One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990's, My Best Friend's Wedding not only gave Julia Roberts a delightful vehicle for her crowd- pleasing comeback, but it further distinguished itself by avoiding the conventional plotting of the genre.Thanks to her charming performance and a subversive spin on the genre, this movie is a refreshingly entertaining.Rupert Everett scored rave reviews for his scene-stealing performance as Robert's gay friend who goes along with her scheming, and even as she makes her character's needy desperation disarmingly appealing, Roberts wisely allows Diaz to capitalize on her charming time in the spotlight. As the romantic outcome remains uncertain, the viewer is held in a state of giddy suspense, and director Hogan pulls off some hilarious scenes that could easily have fallen flat in the hands of a less talented filmmaker.Also, Hogan does manage to make his attractive leads look like complete idiots, no mean achievement in image-obsessed Hollywood.No wonder it happens to be the second most popular film of Roberts after Pretty Woman.

    From what I've read here on IMDb this one split the vote straight down the middle, seems you either love it or loathe it. I found a lot to admire and little to dislike. It comes out of a long tradition that dates back to the earliest talkies; attractive, affluent people, living in luxurious apartments/houses, wearing expensive clothes, dining in expensive restaurants and generally being charming and romantic. We've been there with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, Grant and Katherine Hepburn, Grant and Ingrid Bergman, Fred and Ginger, Claudette Colbert, Audrey Hepburn, Franchot Tone, Bill Holden, Doris Day, Rock Hudson and now the new generation, epitomized here by Julia Roberts. The story is relatively unimportant, all we ask is twelve reels of escapism, a set piece or two, a song or two, lots of laughter balanced by the odd tear, a souffl&eacute;' that segues into a lemon mousse and sends us out into the night with a smile on our face and warmth in our heart. This one delivers as well as any and better than most.

    nice, sweet, intelligent, seductive comedy. sure, not great but perfect for be more than a new pink story. Rupert Everett is perfect key for tale, Julia Roberts is perfect choice for ex girl friend but the axis, the top and the heart of film is Cameron Diaz in one of her best roles. it is a good film because it is excellent puzzle. love, hate, humor, vulnerability, the bitch, the innocent young woman, the naive lover and slices of meetings are directed with precise and full of grace art. so, it is a comedy and little more. picture of choices and shadows of past, subtle nuances of dialogs and a wise cast are central pieces of a build in which all is basket of crumbs from a hided Shakespeare.

    Granted, I should never have walked into this one but it was Tight-arse Tuesday so I wasn't fussy. The musical piece at the restaurant was nicely done, but I refuse to believe that the lead man would pass up on a smart, pretty Julia Roberts then commit to an annoying blonde whose beauty is not even skin deep (Diaz looked fantastic in The Mask but she must have been wearing one at the time). I soldiered on thru the obvious cigarette ad in the hallway, but as the wedding approached, i honestly didn't care who did what. Amazingly, my mate felt exactly the same and we walked out after nothing more than a nod and a wink. No spoilers here: I still don't know the ending..

    How true was My Best Friend's Wedding? Well, I've lived it, and yes, I was the bad guy. Sure, I didn't sabotage a wedding, nor someone's life. But, I didn't partake in a lot of the jealousy and plots she did, sadly enough. So, I'm neither proud or ashamed of what I did in my own existence, I can safely say, what she did in this fantastic movie, was true-to-life. Let's get the synopsis out of the way: non-committal Julianne (Julia Roberts) has a best (male) friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) she once dated and they made a pack: if neither is married by a certain age, then they will settle (is that the right word  even though they didn't state that themselves?) and marry each other. Julianne receives a call/voice mail out of the bluecoincidently enough, close to the birthday of said agefrom Michael. Immediately, she thinks it's a proposal. Close enough: he's announcing his (quick) engagement to Kim (Cameron Diaz) and he wants Julianne to be there for him. While thrust into the wedding arrangements and "best man's role," she plots to apply a large wedge between the happy couple in order to get Michael all to herself, despite her own spiritual conscience and a physical one, in the form of her (other best) friend, George (Rupert Everett) and his constant pleas for her to do the right thing: be honest with him and let the happy couple marry. The movie is both extremely humorous and deep. It's heartfelt and real, while delivering fantastic one-liners with a great soundtrack. It could literally happen, and probably does  again, I'm proof. Okay, mine dealt with a best friend of mine that I was in love with for many years. Though we "acted" upon it multiple times  and I am surely downplaying that, my half of the relationship was built on pure love. Unfortunately, not only was the feelings not reciprocated, but I was told constantly, despite the repetitiveness of the actions, that this was anything but unemotional. I saw a lot in Julianne that I saw within myself. Hers, thankfully, ended in a weekend per the movie's timeline. Miserably, mine lasted seven years. Enough about me. Suffice to say, I KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING THRU. And beyond that, the movie lifts me up, makes me laugh and definitely makes me cry  each and every time I see it. It's both lighthearted and deep. It has fantastic scenes individually and on a whole  such as the singing group, led by a wonderful Rupert Everett for "I Say A Little Prayer." It's one of my all-time favorite films and soundtracks. Ever been through this? Have you ever loved someone so much it hurt? Physically? Ever act on it, even though you know that was the wrong course? WATCH this movie. Live it. Love it. And watch one of the most realistic endings Hollywood has ever produced. It may not be the finale you were looking for, but it's the most honest.

    This movie was very cute and had a lot of funny little parts in it. It has Julie Roberts AND Cameron Diaz so who could go wrong? Good acting and storyline. The gentlemen in the movie are also charming and handsome. It has some heartwarming parts and other parts of suspense and comedy. A must see for the romantic at heart. I always imagine Julie Roberts as sweet and innocent and although "adorable" as always in this movie, she plays a somewhat jealous and sneaky "best friend" who tries to ruin the wedding because she hasn't ever had the courage to tell her best friend she is in love with him. Is she truly in love or is she just suffering doubts about her feelings for her long time friend? We may never know. I think she's a lucky lady either way her heart is turned because she has TWO handsome male best friends in this movie! That's another cute thing about this movie... to see two strong male roles that are not vulgar or hostile towards women but romantic and supportive. A refreshing change from some other stereotypical male roles we see a lot of these days. Cool movie.. I give it an 8/10!

    This was one movie ending that we thoroughly agreed with - and not because the couple got together, but because they didn't. Jules Potter is way too selfish to be in a relationship with anyone. Jules and Michael have been friends since college, and one year they made a pact that if neither of them were married by the time they were 28 (really? Did they go to school in Utah?) they would marry each other. When Michael calls on the eve (eve eve) of Jules' birthday she assumes it's to call in his marker. When she finds out that he is instead calling to announce that he's engaged to someone else, Jules suddenly decides that he's the one for her, and spends the next three days doing everything in her power to break up the clearly happy couple. Talk about wanting what you can't have. Jules doesn't want to win Michael over; she just wants to win. Is this really how you treat your best friend? Clearly not, as Jules doesn't win the guy in the end after all. Three days of sabotage - flirting, prancing about in her underwear, trying to provoke Michael's jealousy by pretending to be engaged to her best gay friend George, attempting to humiliate Kimmy, the bride-to-be, in a karaoke bar, sending manipulative emails from Kimmy's father, and finally - confessing her newly discovered "love" for Michael and forcing her lips on him - are all done in vain. Just when you're wondering how much farther she'll take it, Jules finally comes to the realization that Michael's love for Kimmy cannot be swayed by her cheap antics. And in the end it's Michael and Kimmy who get married and sail off into the sunset. We shudder to think what happens when George announces he's met someone. Will she prance around him in Gucci couture? Move to Chelsea? Have a sex change operation? We think Michael, Kimmy and George need to find some new friends. www.reel-couples.com

    It came to 27-year-old New York restaurant critic Julianne Potter's (Julia Roberts) attention when she was having a meal with her gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett). Longtime friend Michael O'Neil had called her to say that he is going to get married in four days' time, to Kimberley Wallace (Cameron Diaz), who is a University of Chicago student from a wealthy family. It upsets Julianne, knowing that back in college, he and Michael had made an agreement that if they were not married by the time they reach 28, they will marry each other. But not only that, Michael had only known the 20-year-old Kimberley for a short period of time. Julianne realises that she is in love with her longtime friend and set out to prevent the wedding from taking place. While at the same time, to be Kimberley's maid of honour. It sets off a series of comical sequences like taking Kimberley and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimberley is a terrible singer and asking the gay friend George to pretend that they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous of Julianne. Unfortunately the plans did not work. George then advised Julianne to do the obvious: Tell Michael up front that she is in love with him. So on the morning of the wedding, Julianne finally confessed her true feelings to her longtime friend, asked him to marry her instead, and kisses him. Kimberley unfortunately saw it all and ran off with Michael chasing her, and Julianne chases him unsuccessfully...or so she thought. She spotted Michael at the train station and finally accepted the fact that she has lost Michael to Kimberley. She went to apologise to Kimberley and explained the whole situation, including that he did not kissed her back. The wedding did took place after all, with Julianne as Kimberley's maid of honour wishing them well. And she being consoled by George as well. To have Julia Roberts playing the role of the person to steal her friend's future spouse may be just wrong given one does not associate her in that kind of role, but one probably cannot help but wonder whether she can do it in the end. Whether one was rooting for Julia Roberts in her role as Julianne or not, there is also other reasons to like this film. Like the supporting cast especially Rupert Everett as George.

Suffice to say, I KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING THRU. And beyond that, the movie lifts me up, makes me laugh and definitely makes me cry  each and every time I see it. It's both lighthearted and deep. It has fantastic scenes individually and on a whole  such as the singing group, led by a wonderful Rupert Everett for "I Say A Little Prayer." It's one of my all-time favorite films and soundtracks. Ever been through this? Have you ever loved someone so much it hurt? Physically? Ever act on it, even though you know that was the wrong course? WATCH this movie. Live it. Love it. And watch one of the most realistic endings Hollywood has ever produced. It may not be the finale you were looking for, but it's the most honest.

    This movie was very cute and had a lot of funny little parts in it. It has Julie Roberts AND Cameron Diaz so who could go wrong? Good acting and storyline. The gentlemen in the movie are also charming and handsome. It has some heartwarming parts and other parts of suspense and comedy. A must see for the romantic at heart. I always imagine Julie Roberts as sweet and innocent and although "adorable" as always in this movie, she plays a somewhat jealous and sneaky "best friend" who tries to ruin the wedding because she hasn't ever had the courage to tell her best friend she is in love with him. Is she truly in love or is she just suffering doubts about her feelings for her long time friend? We may never know. I think she's a lucky lady either way her heart is turned because she has TWO handsome male best friends in this movie! That's another cute thing about this movie... to see two strong male roles that are not vulgar or hostile towards women but romantic and supportive. A refreshing change from some other stereotypical male roles we see a lot of these days. Cool movie.. I give it an 8/10!

    This was one movie ending that we thoroughly agreed with - and not because the couple got together, but because they didn't. Jules Potter is way too selfish to be in a relationship with anyone. Jules and Michael have been friends since college, and one year they made a pact that if neither of them were married by the time they were 28 (really? Did they go to school in Utah?) they would marry each other. When Michael calls on the eve (eve eve) of Jules' birthday she assumes it's to call in his marker. When she finds out that he is instead calling to announce that he's engaged to someone else, Jules suddenly decides that he's the one for her, and spends the next three days doing everything in her power to break up the clearly happy couple. Talk about wanting what you can't have. Jules doesn't want to win Michael over; she just wants to win. Is this really how you treat your best friend? Clearly not, as Jules doesn't win the guy in the end after all. Three days of sabotage - flirting, prancing about in her underwear, trying to provoke Michael's jealousy by pretending to be engaged to her best gay friend George, attempting to humiliate Kimmy, the bride-to-be, in a karaoke bar, sending manipulative emails from Kimmy's father, and finally - confessing her newly discovered "love" for Michael and forcing her lips on him - are all done in vain. Just when you're wondering how much farther she'll take it, Jules finally comes to the realization that Michael's love for Kimmy cannot be swayed by her cheap antics. And in the end it's Michael and Kimmy who get married and sail off into the sunset. We shudder to think what happens when George announces he's met someone. Will she prance around him in Gucci couture? Move to Chelsea? Have a sex change operation? We think Michael, Kimmy and George need to find some new friends. www.reel-couples.com

    It came to 27-year-old New York restaurant critic Julianne Potter's (Julia Roberts) attention when she was having a meal with her gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett). Longtime friend Michael O'Neil had called her to say that he is going to get married in four days' time, to Kimberley Wallace (Cameron Diaz), who is a University of Chicago student from a wealthy family. It upsets Julianne, knowing that back in college, he and Michael had made an agreement that if they were not married by the time they reach 28, they will marry each other. But not only that, Michael had only known the 20-year-old Kimberley for a short period of time. Julianne realises that she is in love with her longtime friend and set out to prevent the wedding from taking place. While at the same time, to be Kimberley's maid of honour. It sets off a series of comical sequences like taking Kimberley and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimberley is a terrible singer and asking the gay friend George to pretend that they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous of Julianne. Unfortunately the plans did not work. George then advised Julianne to do the obvious: Tell Michael up front that she is in love with him. So on the morning of the wedding, Julianne finally confessed her true feelings to her longtime friend, asked him to marry her instead, and kisses him. Kimberley unfortunately saw it all and ran off with Michael chasing her, and Julianne chases him unsuccessfully...or so she thought. She spotted Michael at the train station and finally accepted the fact that she has lost Michael to Kimberley. She went to apologise to Kimberley and explained the whole situation, including that he did not kissed her back. The wedding did took place after all, with Julianne as Kimberley's maid of honour wishing them well. And she being consoled by George as well. To have Julia Roberts playing the role of the person to steal her friend's future spouse may be just wrong given one does not associate her in that kind of role, but one probably cannot help but wonder whether she can do it in the end. Whether one was rooting for Julia Roberts in her role as Julianne or not, there is also other reasons to like this film. Like the supporting cast especially Rupert Everett as George.
