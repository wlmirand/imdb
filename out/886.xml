    The title of this movie intrigued me somehow and so I hired it. I thought it was funny and I am glad that I did hire it because I did quite enjoy it. The humour was actually quite decent humour and not the typical try-hard humour that most romantic comedies, as this is what A Life Less Ordinary is, tend to display. Now heaven is getting quite upset at the number of relationships that are falling apart so two angels are sent to Earth to bring two people together and if they don't then they cannot return. The two people are completely the opposite, which is typically American, and so the angels see it is basically an impossible task. One of them is a dreamer who works as a cleaner and wants to write trashy novels, while the other is the rich daughter of the guy's employer. The guy is sacked from his job and replaced with robots and then he looses his current girlfriend and is kicked out of home due to unpaid rent. He then, in frustration, barges into his bosses office with a gun and demands his job back. The daughter is simply lazy and a crack shot. A dentist wants to marry her but she is not interested so she decides to test him by shooting an apple off the top of his head. He moves and is hit in the head. She is then brought to her father and is told that she now has to work for his money. Now, she is in the office when he bursts in and he ends up kidnapping her, but it turns out that she knows more about kidnapping than he does so decides to teach him a few lessons. Well, this is how the movie turns out. Of course it is predictable as a romantic comedy as it is not a movie where both parties end up dead, as they do in Romeo and Juliet. In fact, Shakespeare actually wrote a lot of decent romantic comedies, but they are intelligent, unlike the garbage that is churned out of Hollywood these days. A Life Less Ordinary is not one of those garbage movies, though it doesn't really rise to the heights of a Shakespearian comedy. My really only complaint with the movie is how it deals with heaven. Basically God is not in control and sits away from everything letting the world run itself. Occasionally he sticks his hand in to make things run a little smoother but generally he doesn't care. Also, there is the idea that the rich go to heaven and the poor go to hell and there is no way out of that. Really that is just absolute garbage and shows how people seriously don't understand the way God operates. God doesn't judge us on wealth or on how good we've been. Rather he judges us on who we have given our life to. If we have told God to get lost then that is it, we don't want him then he doesn't want us. But if we ask God to be on our side, then he will take us as a friend and welcome us into eternity.

    I really loved this movie, it was well written, well directed, and well acted, and the icing on the cake is Cameron Diaz, she is quite the package, smoking hot with a great personality and is just awesome in this movie. Ewan McGregor is no slouch either, his high energy keeps the film moving at a nice steady pace. What really ties it together is a perfect sound track. The entire film is planted with mood enhancing songs that roll flawless with each scene. What I loved is how the director kept the film light, no overly heavy scenes, keeping it fun throughout the entire picture. Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo's characters were hilarious and I found myself constantly rooting for them. I would put this film in my top 20 favorite movies and I highly suggest watching it.

    I recently purchased ALLO having not seen it in a long time. I had fond memories of a number of scenes and the movie was really cheap in a second hand store. In the first hour all of the scenes I remembered popped up and I was thoroughly enjoying myself, whilst wondering why the film had a comparatively poor rating both with audiences and critics. The chemistry between the leads is good and there are a lot of funny moments as Ewan Macgregor's character struggles with his inability to be a bad guy and Cameron Diaz tries to manipulate the situation to meet her own ends. Holly Hunters playfully seductive angel is also perfect opposite Delroy Lindo. Unfortunately the bag swap comes about 40 minutes too early in the film and from here the wheels come off. We are given scene after scene, each one more ridiculous than the last, of the two would be lovers getting mad at each other. Although the fantastical elements of the film can be accepted, there is at least one scene where the inevitable repercussions cannot be ignored but are never addressed. For a film that has such a strong first half, the second half verges on boring. For me that's probably the worst thing that can be said of any movie. The soundtrack is no doubt great if you're playing the CD in the car. However the placing of the songs seems all wrong, like Boyle was simply trying to replicate what he had achieved in Trainspotting where the songs underlined the scenes perfectly. All in all, for me this was a typical Danny Boyle film (with the exception of Trainspotting). It promised so much yet was let down by some fatal flaws.

    If the name of Danny Boyle is often synonym of success, the Englishman is also capable of directing more than mediocre movies such as this A Life Less Ordinary. It relies on a qualitatively low script. Everything is convenient, clich&eacute;, the plot unfolds really too linearly and is in the end little interesting. The fantastic touch, more boring than anything, doesn't help either. The Diaz-McGregor works difficultly and struggles to extricate itself from this mess where characters and situations are stereotyped. Even the direction is uninspired, not to mention the soundtrack that is almost ridiculous, which is a shame when speaking of Boyle. It is maybe the worst feature of the director, along with Millions, both movies sharing as a matter of fact the same mystical tone.

    After rising to directorial fame with the very European Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle decided to live a little and make his own American road movie A Life Less Ordinary. The film is the third collaboration between Boyle and actor Ewan McGregor. This time around McGregor plays Robert Lewis, a janitor for a large company who gets fired and replaced by a robot. In order to get back at the company he kidnaps the CEO's daughter, Cameron Diaz. An unlikely relationship develops between the kidnapper and kidnapee, a relationship helped along by two "angels" who are in charge of matchmaking human beings on Earth. It's a quirky romantic comedy with an unexpectedly violent streak running down the middle. It's hard to comprehend exactly what this movie is trying to accomplish. It's romantic but not exactly touching. It's comedic without being overtly hilarious. It's eccentric and violent without feeling like an exploitation film. This weird mix of clashing genres actually does the film some good though, as it really is a lot of fun. It's strange, it's offbeat, and it's plenty entertaining from start to finish. It's got that Danny Boyle style that courses so strong through the auteur's veins. Of course you can't expect Trainspotting from it because A Life Less Ordinary is substantially watered down, and doesn't have the kind of human element we see in a dark character study like Trainspotting. The story is nothing special, but it's fun and it serves its purpose. Again, I'm not sure what the point of A Life Less Ordinary is, but neither do I really care. Boyle has himself a fun little film here with enough quirkiness to keep it lively and interesting for an hour and 42 minutes.

    a life less ordinary is one of those movies that just misses the mark.... which is a shame, because it has the potential to be a really good movie. first, the fantasy sequences are not needed, they fall flat, just aren't done well and don't add anything to the movie. the director could learn a lesson from the coehn brothers on how to successfully use fantasy sequences. the whole angel premise is also not needed and just seems really contrived and just gets in the way and muddles everything up. cameron diaz and ewan mcgregor's performances and chemistry are excellent, as are the rest of the performances from the eccentric secondary cast. the scene play is way too all over the place and does not keep you on the edge of your seat, instead i found my mind wandering, thinking to myself, what a job the coehn brothers could have done with this material and actors. oh well, nice try, but i can't recommend this movie other then for the performances of the actors.

    OK you have to loose yourself a little in it. It's still a fairy tale. It involves angels coming down from heaven. Don't expect something believable and you might just enjoy this. Personally, I'm an atheist and this is one of my favourite movies of all time. Expect all the usual Danny Boyle trimmings that he's since become renowned for. Awesome cast, stunningly shot and, of course, a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Faithless, Ash, Beck and REM. Was one of his first big screen director roles. He is quoted as saying it's one of his favourite that he directed. As it isn't one of the movies that people naturally think of when they think of his work. Give it a go. But do it with an open mind prepared to embrace an element of fairy-tale and you'll probably enjoy it.

    I have to admit that for some time now I have been a bit of a fan of the work of Danny Boyle. As such, I'm made it a bit of a mission to take a look at as much of his back catalogue as I can whenever they are shown on TV. So this is how I came to watch this one. I have to say it's not the best film I've seen associated with his name, but it's passable. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary. We start in heaven (where else), where two angels, O'Reilly and Jackson, are given their last chance to, let's say, facilitate a couple falling in love. It's a tough case; two people from very different backgrounds. First there's Robert Lewis who's a cleaner (& a writer in his spare time) who has just lost his job and been dumped by his girlfriend. Then there's Celine Naville a rich socialite whose father wants her to go to work for him. They are thrown together when Robert goes to see Celine's father to demand his job back and things go slightly wrong. He ends up kidnapping Celine and taking her to a cabin in the wilderness. He really doesn't have a clue and Celine ends up taking the lead; deciding she may as well try to get some money out of her father. Meanwhile, O'Reilly and Jackson are hired by Celine's father to find them. As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated already and we're only part-way through! I'll leave it there though or the Spoiler Police (confusing plots division) will have me kidnapped in amusing circumstances (again). A well made film that has the beginnings many of the hallmarks of Boyle's latter works. Some interesting ideas thrown in, some that worked and some that didn't, but then I see it as a bit of a stepping stone for Boyle. Nice performances all round; Ewan McGregor did a decent job as Robert Lewis, although his haircut is pretty bizarre! Cameron Diaz did a great job as Celine; it's the kind of role she's pretty comfortable in. I thought both Holly Hunter as O'Reilly and Delroy Lindo as Jackson were excellent. Honourable mentions must also go to; Ian McNeice as Mayhew, Frank Kanig as Ted, Stanley Tucci as Elliot Zweikel, Tony Shalhoub as Al and Ian Holm as Naville (Celine's father). Although I'm a fan of Danny Boyle's work, I'm afraid this one failed to hit the mark (for me). I found the plot far too over-complicated, almost like they were trying to fit far too many ideas in all at once. To me it would have been much more interesting to see the story from the point of view of O'Reilly and Jackson, but then I guess I'm not a screenwriter (yet). Yes, there were some nice touches, for instance, I loved the song and dance routine in the bar; very funny. Over all though, it's one I'll have to sit on the fence as far as recommendation goes; it's kind of in the middle there somewhere. My score: 5.7/10 IMDb Score: 6.3/10 (based on 20,915 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 39/100 (based on 36 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 56/100 (based on 52,726 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    I saw this film in theatres when it had just come out, much abuzz about both Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz. While not wholly disappointed by the film, I was left stunned. Two days prior to seeing this I had just watched on television Two of a Kind with John Travolta and Olivia Newton John. I had read reviews saying this was an original story(ALLO) and a breath of fresh air. This is not so, I urge you to read the summary for Two of a Kind(don't see the film unless you like 80's garbage films) and see if the 2 contrast(they don't). While I'm all for a well scripted and acted romantic comedy, don't profess originality unless you know it to be so. I am still a huge Danny Boyle(Sunsine one of my personal favourites) and Ewan McGregor(Renton all time anti-hero) fan, this film just helps to remind me that no one is ever perfect.

    This is not a good film. It's enjoyable according to a number of things you can get from many other films. Conventional comedy values built around romantic stories. Escapism in recognizable form for anyone vaguely used to Hollywood. But this is a little bit more than that. It's part of a trilogy of films featuring a trilogy of interesting artists: Boyle/Hodge/McGregor. This set of films was important for it established the basis of 2 interesting and important careers (Hodge in the meanwhile seems to have deviated from interesting stuff, let's hope he comes back). What they did was what one might call experimentalism, or even theoretical experiments leaked onto practical products. Of the 3 films, this is probably the less interesting. It's not especially entertaining, and even as an experiment it's not especially interesting. The point was to pick up a specific genre, romantic comedy in this case, and twist it or at least give it a new edge. The result falls a lot behind what, say, the Coens did in Intolerable Cruelty. Still, McGregor would become a powerful actor, one of the best, and Boyle is always worthwhile no matter what he does, and he's done some impressive stuff since. So, this film becomes a sort of an historical artifact if you want to do archaeological research of their careers. What you learn here is that from the beginning Boyle trusts his intuition, and that vein prevails over how he rationalizes his film conceptions. Those intuitions may be really powerful or come to nothing (like here), but he's always willing to take the chance, and i appreciate him for that, i'll want to see anything from him. And you learn that McGregor, already back here was self-conscious as an actor. He knows he's acting, so the question is not so much to be "real" (as an obscene amount of actors always try to) but to deliver the acting while acknowledging it. That's probably the more fundamental theme of the art in the last century. As far as cinema acting goes, Ewan McGregor may be its state of art. But this film, unless you place it in the perspective of their makers future, is pretty much useless. My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

    I have to admit that for some time now I have been a bit of a fan of the work of Danny Boyle. As such, I'm made it a bit of a mission to take a look at as much of his back catalogue as I can whenever they are shown on TV. So this is how I came to watch this one. I have to say it's not the best film I've seen associated with his name, but it's passable. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary. We start in heaven (where else), where two angels, O'Reilly and Jackson, are given their last chance to, let's say, facilitate a couple falling in love. It's a tough case; two people from very different backgrounds. First there's Robert Lewis who's a cleaner (& a writer in his spare time) who has just lost his job and been dumped by his girlfriend. Then there's Celine Naville a rich socialite whose father wants her to go to work for him. They are thrown together when Robert goes to see Celine's father to demand his job back and things go slightly wrong. He ends up kidnapping Celine and taking her to a cabin in the wilderness. He really doesn't have a clue and Celine ends up taking the lead; deciding she may as well try to get some money out of her father. Meanwhile, O'Reilly and Jackson are hired by Celine's father to find them. As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated already and we're only part-way through! I'll leave it there though or the Spoiler Police (confusing plots division) will have me kidnapped in amusing circumstances (again). A well made film that has the beginnings many of the hallmarks of Boyle's latter works. Some interesting ideas thrown in, some that worked and some that didn't, but then I see it as a bit of a stepping stone for Boyle. Nice performances all round; Ewan McGregor did a decent job as Robert Lewis, although his haircut is pretty bizarre! Cameron Diaz did a great job as Celine; it's the kind of role she's pretty comfortable in. I thought both Holly Hunter as O'Reilly and Delroy Lindo as Jackson were excellent. Honourable mentions must also go to; Ian McNeice as Mayhew, Frank Kanig as Ted, Stanley Tucci as Elliot Zweikel, Tony Shalhoub as Al and Ian Holm as Naville (Celine's father). Although I'm a fan of Danny Boyle's work, I'm afraid this one failed to hit the mark (for me). I found the plot far too over-complicated, almost like they were trying to fit far too many ideas in all at once. To me it would have been much more interesting to see the story from the point of view of O'Reilly and Jackson, but then I guess I'm not a screenwriter (yet). Yes, there were some nice touches, for instance, I loved the song and dance routine in the bar; very funny. Over all though, it's one I'll have to sit on the fence as far as recommendation goes; it's kind of in the middle there somewhere. My score: 5.7/10 IMDb Score: 6.3/10 (based on 20,915 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 39/100 (based on 36 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 56/100 (based on 52,726 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    I saw this film in theatres when it had just come out, much abuzz about both Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz. While not wholly disappointed by the film, I was left stunned. Two days prior to seeing this I had just watched on television Two of a Kind with John Travolta and Olivia Newton John. I had read reviews saying this was an original story(ALLO) and a breath of fresh air. This is not so, I urge you to read the summary for Two of a Kind(don't see the film unless you like 80's garbage films) and see if the 2 contrast(they don't). While I'm all for a well scripted and acted romantic comedy, don't profess originality unless you know it to be so. I am still a huge Danny Boyle(Sunsine one of my personal favourites) and Ewan McGregor(Renton all time anti-hero) fan, this film just helps to remind me that no one is ever perfect.

    This is not a good film. It's enjoyable according to a number of things you can get from many other films. Conventional comedy values built around romantic stories. Escapism in recognizable form for anyone vaguely used to Hollywood. But this is a little bit more than that. It's part of a trilogy of films featuring a trilogy of interesting artists: Boyle/Hodge/McGregor. This set of films was important for it established the basis of 2 interesting and important careers (Hodge in the meanwhile seems to have deviated from interesting stuff, let's hope he comes back). What they did was what one might call experimentalism, or even theoretical experiments leaked onto practical products. Of the 3 films, this is probably the less interesting. It's not especially entertaining, and even as an experiment it's not especially interesting. The point was to pick up a specific genre, romantic comedy in this case, and twist it or at least give it a new edge. The result falls a lot behind what, say, the Coens did in Intolerable Cruelty. Still, McGregor would become a powerful actor, one of the best, and Boyle is always worthwhile no matter what he does, and he's done some impressive stuff since. So, this film becomes a sort of an historical artifact if you want to do archaeological research of their careers. What you learn here is that from the beginning Boyle trusts his intuition, and that vein prevails over how he rationalizes his film conceptions. Those intuitions may be really powerful or come to nothing (like here), but he's always willing to take the chance, and i appreciate him for that, i'll want to see anything from him. And you learn that McGregor, already back here was self-conscious as an actor. He knows he's acting, so the question is not so much to be "real" (as an obscene amount of actors always try to) but to deliver the acting while acknowledging it. That's probably the more fundamental theme of the art in the last century. As far as cinema acting goes, Ewan McGregor may be its state of art. But this film, unless you place it in the perspective of their makers future, is pretty much useless. My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

    The title of this movie intrigued me somehow and so I hired it. I thought it was funny and I am glad that I did hire it because I did quite enjoy it. The humour was actually quite decent humour and not the typical try-hard humour that most romantic comedies, as this is what A Life Less Ordinary is, tend to display. Now heaven is getting quite upset at the number of relationships that are falling apart so two angels are sent to Earth to bring two people together and if they don't then they cannot return. The two people are completely the opposite, which is typically American, and so the angels see it is basically an impossible task. One of them is a dreamer who works as a cleaner and wants to write trashy novels, while the other is the rich daughter of the guy's employer. The guy is sacked from his job and replaced with robots and then he looses his current girlfriend and is kicked out of home due to unpaid rent. He then, in frustration, barges into his bosses office with a gun and demands his job back. The daughter is simply lazy and a crack shot. A dentist wants to marry her but she is not interested so she decides to test him by shooting an apple off the top of his head. He moves and is hit in the head. She is then brought to her father and is told that she now has to work for his money. Now, she is in the office when he bursts in and he ends up kidnapping her, but it turns out that she knows more about kidnapping than he does so decides to teach him a few lessons. Well, this is how the movie turns out. Of course it is predictable as a romantic comedy as it is not a movie where both parties end up dead, as they do in Romeo and Juliet. In fact, Shakespeare actually wrote a lot of decent romantic comedies, but they are intelligent, unlike the garbage that is churned out of Hollywood these days. A Life Less Ordinary is not one of those garbage movies, though it doesn't really rise to the heights of a Shakespearian comedy. My really only complaint with the movie is how it deals with heaven. Basically God is not in control and sits away from everything letting the world run itself. Occasionally he sticks his hand in to make things run a little smoother but generally he doesn't care. Also, there is the idea that the rich go to heaven and the poor go to hell and there is no way out of that. Really that is just absolute garbage and shows how people seriously don't understand the way God operates. God doesn't judge us on wealth or on how good we've been. Rather he judges us on who we have given our life to. If we have told God to get lost then that is it, we don't want him then he doesn't want us. But if we ask God to be on our side, then he will take us as a friend and welcome us into eternity.

    I really loved this movie, it was well written, well directed, and well acted, and the icing on the cake is Cameron Diaz, she is quite the package, smoking hot with a great personality and is just awesome in this movie. Ewan McGregor is no slouch either, his high energy keeps the film moving at a nice steady pace. What really ties it together is a perfect sound track. The entire film is planted with mood enhancing songs that roll flawless with each scene. What I loved is how the director kept the film light, no overly heavy scenes, keeping it fun throughout the entire picture. Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo's characters were hilarious and I found myself constantly rooting for them. I would put this film in my top 20 favorite movies and I highly suggest watching it.

    I recently purchased ALLO having not seen it in a long time. I had fond memories of a number of scenes and the movie was really cheap in a second hand store. In the first hour all of the scenes I remembered popped up and I was thoroughly enjoying myself, whilst wondering why the film had a comparatively poor rating both with audiences and critics. The chemistry between the leads is good and there are a lot of funny moments as Ewan Macgregor's character struggles with his inability to be a bad guy and Cameron Diaz tries to manipulate the situation to meet her own ends. Holly Hunters playfully seductive angel is also perfect opposite Delroy Lindo. Unfortunately the bag swap comes about 40 minutes too early in the film and from here the wheels come off. We are given scene after scene, each one more ridiculous than the last, of the two would be lovers getting mad at each other. Although the fantastical elements of the film can be accepted, there is at least one scene where the inevitable repercussions cannot be ignored but are never addressed. For a film that has such a strong first half, the second half verges on boring. For me that's probably the worst thing that can be said of any movie. The soundtrack is no doubt great if you're playing the CD in the car. However the placing of the songs seems all wrong, like Boyle was simply trying to replicate what he had achieved in Trainspotting where the songs underlined the scenes perfectly. All in all, for me this was a typical Danny Boyle film (with the exception of Trainspotting). It promised so much yet was let down by some fatal flaws.

    If the name of Danny Boyle is often synonym of success, the Englishman is also capable of directing more than mediocre movies such as this A Life Less Ordinary. It relies on a qualitatively low script. Everything is convenient, clich&eacute;, the plot unfolds really too linearly and is in the end little interesting. The fantastic touch, more boring than anything, doesn't help either. The Diaz-McGregor works difficultly and struggles to extricate itself from this mess where characters and situations are stereotyped. Even the direction is uninspired, not to mention the soundtrack that is almost ridiculous, which is a shame when speaking of Boyle. It is maybe the worst feature of the director, along with Millions, both movies sharing as a matter of fact the same mystical tone.

    After rising to directorial fame with the very European Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle decided to live a little and make his own American road movie A Life Less Ordinary. The film is the third collaboration between Boyle and actor Ewan McGregor. This time around McGregor plays Robert Lewis, a janitor for a large company who gets fired and replaced by a robot. In order to get back at the company he kidnaps the CEO's daughter, Cameron Diaz. An unlikely relationship develops between the kidnapper and kidnapee, a relationship helped along by two "angels" who are in charge of matchmaking human beings on Earth. It's a quirky romantic comedy with an unexpectedly violent streak running down the middle. It's hard to comprehend exactly what this movie is trying to accomplish. It's romantic but not exactly touching. It's comedic without being overtly hilarious. It's eccentric and violent without feeling like an exploitation film. This weird mix of clashing genres actually does the film some good though, as it really is a lot of fun. It's strange, it's offbeat, and it's plenty entertaining from start to finish. It's got that Danny Boyle style that courses so strong through the auteur's veins. Of course you can't expect Trainspotting from it because A Life Less Ordinary is substantially watered down, and doesn't have the kind of human element we see in a dark character study like Trainspotting. The story is nothing special, but it's fun and it serves its purpose. Again, I'm not sure what the point of A Life Less Ordinary is, but neither do I really care. Boyle has himself a fun little film here with enough quirkiness to keep it lively and interesting for an hour and 42 minutes.

    a life less ordinary is one of those movies that just misses the mark.... which is a shame, because it has the potential to be a really good movie. first, the fantasy sequences are not needed, they fall flat, just aren't done well and don't add anything to the movie. the director could learn a lesson from the coehn brothers on how to successfully use fantasy sequences. the whole angel premise is also not needed and just seems really contrived and just gets in the way and muddles everything up. cameron diaz and ewan mcgregor's performances and chemistry are excellent, as are the rest of the performances from the eccentric secondary cast. the scene play is way too all over the place and does not keep you on the edge of your seat, instead i found my mind wandering, thinking to myself, what a job the coehn brothers could have done with this material and actors. oh well, nice try, but i can't recommend this movie other then for the performances of the actors.

    OK you have to loose yourself a little in it. It's still a fairy tale. It involves angels coming down from heaven. Don't expect something believable and you might just enjoy this. Personally, I'm an atheist and this is one of my favourite movies of all time. Expect all the usual Danny Boyle trimmings that he's since become renowned for. Awesome cast, stunningly shot and, of course, a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Faithless, Ash, Beck and REM. Was one of his first big screen director roles. He is quoted as saying it's one of his favourite that he directed. As it isn't one of the movies that people naturally think of when they think of his work. Give it a go. But do it with an open mind prepared to embrace an element of fairy-tale and you'll probably enjoy it.

It relies on a qualitatively low script. Everything is convenient, clich&eacute;, the plot unfolds really too linearly and is in the end little interesting. The fantastic touch, more boring than anything, doesn't help either. The Diaz-McGregor works difficultly and struggles to extricate itself from this mess where characters and situations are stereotyped. Even the direction is uninspired, not to mention the soundtrack that is almost ridiculous, which is a shame when speaking of Boyle. It is maybe the worst feature of the director, along with Millions, both movies sharing as a matter of fact the same mystical tone.

    After rising to directorial fame with the very European Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle decided to live a little and make his own American road movie A Life Less Ordinary. The film is the third collaboration between Boyle and actor Ewan McGregor. This time around McGregor plays Robert Lewis, a janitor for a large company who gets fired and replaced by a robot. In order to get back at the company he kidnaps the CEO's daughter, Cameron Diaz. An unlikely relationship develops between the kidnapper and kidnapee, a relationship helped along by two "angels" who are in charge of matchmaking human beings on Earth. It's a quirky romantic comedy with an unexpectedly violent streak running down the middle. It's hard to comprehend exactly what this movie is trying to accomplish. It's romantic but not exactly touching. It's comedic without being overtly hilarious. It's eccentric and violent without feeling like an exploitation film. This weird mix of clashing genres actually does the film some good though, as it really is a lot of fun. It's strange, it's offbeat, and it's plenty entertaining from start to finish. It's got that Danny Boyle style that courses so strong through the auteur's veins. Of course you can't expect Trainspotting from it because A Life Less Ordinary is substantially watered down, and doesn't have the kind of human element we see in a dark character study like Trainspotting. The story is nothing special, but it's fun and it serves its purpose. Again, I'm not sure what the point of A Life Less Ordinary is, but neither do I really care. Boyle has himself a fun little film here with enough quirkiness to keep it lively and interesting for an hour and 42 minutes.

    a life less ordinary is one of those movies that just misses the mark.... which is a shame, because it has the potential to be a really good movie. first, the fantasy sequences are not needed, they fall flat, just aren't done well and don't add anything to the movie. the director could learn a lesson from the coehn brothers on how to successfully use fantasy sequences. the whole angel premise is also not needed and just seems really contrived and just gets in the way and muddles everything up. cameron diaz and ewan mcgregor's performances and chemistry are excellent, as are the rest of the performances from the eccentric secondary cast. the scene play is way too all over the place and does not keep you on the edge of your seat, instead i found my mind wandering, thinking to myself, what a job the coehn brothers could have done with this material and actors. oh well, nice try, but i can't recommend this movie other then for the performances of the actors.

    OK you have to loose yourself a little in it. It's still a fairy tale. It involves angels coming down from heaven. Don't expect something believable and you might just enjoy this. Personally, I'm an atheist and this is one of my favourite movies of all time. Expect all the usual Danny Boyle trimmings that he's since become renowned for. Awesome cast, stunningly shot and, of course, a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Faithless, Ash, Beck and REM. Was one of his first big screen director roles. He is quoted as saying it's one of his favourite that he directed. As it isn't one of the movies that people naturally think of when they think of his work. Give it a go. But do it with an open mind prepared to embrace an element of fairy-tale and you'll probably enjoy it.

    I have to admit that for some time now I have been a bit of a fan of the work of Danny Boyle. As such, I'm made it a bit of a mission to take a look at as much of his back catalogue as I can whenever they are shown on TV. So this is how I came to watch this one. I have to say it's not the best film I've seen associated with his name, but it's passable. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary. We start in heaven (where else), where two angels, O'Reilly and Jackson, are given their last chance to, let's say, facilitate a couple falling in love. It's a tough case; two people from very different backgrounds. First there's Robert Lewis who's a cleaner (& a writer in his spare time) who has just lost his job and been dumped by his girlfriend. Then there's Celine Naville a rich socialite whose father wants her to go to work for him. They are thrown together when Robert goes to see Celine's father to demand his job back and things go slightly wrong. He ends up kidnapping Celine and taking her to a cabin in the wilderness. He really doesn't have a clue and Celine ends up taking the lead; deciding she may as well try to get some money out of her father. Meanwhile, O'Reilly and Jackson are hired by Celine's father to find them. As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated already and we're only part-way through! I'll leave it there though or the Spoiler Police (confusing plots division) will have me kidnapped in amusing circumstances (again). A well made film that has the beginnings many of the hallmarks of Boyle's latter works. Some interesting ideas thrown in, some that worked and some that didn't, but then I see it as a bit of a stepping stone for Boyle. Nice performances all round; Ewan McGregor did a decent job as Robert Lewis, although his haircut is pretty bizarre! Cameron Diaz did a great job as Celine; it's the kind of role she's pretty comfortable in. I thought both Holly Hunter as O'Reilly and Delroy Lindo as Jackson were excellent. Honourable mentions must also go to; Ian McNeice as Mayhew, Frank Kanig as Ted, Stanley Tucci as Elliot Zweikel, Tony Shalhoub as Al and Ian Holm as Naville (Celine's father). Although I'm a fan of Danny Boyle's work, I'm afraid this one failed to hit the mark (for me). I found the plot far too over-complicated, almost like they were trying to fit far too many ideas in all at once. To me it would have been much more interesting to see the story from the point of view of O'Reilly and Jackson, but then I guess I'm not a screenwriter (yet). Yes, there were some nice touches, for instance, I loved the song and dance routine in the bar; very funny. Over all though, it's one I'll have to sit on the fence as far as recommendation goes; it's kind of in the middle there somewhere. My score: 5.7/10 IMDb Score: 6.3/10 (based on 20,915 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 39/100 (based on 36 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 56/100 (based on 52,726 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    I saw this film in theatres when it had just come out, much abuzz about both Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz. While not wholly disappointed by the film, I was left stunned. Two days prior to seeing this I had just watched on television Two of a Kind with John Travolta and Olivia Newton John. I had read reviews saying this was an original story(ALLO) and a breath of fresh air. This is not so, I urge you to read the summary for Two of a Kind(don't see the film unless you like 80's garbage films) and see if the 2 contrast(they don't). While I'm all for a well scripted and acted romantic comedy, don't profess originality unless you know it to be so. I am still a huge Danny Boyle(Sunsine one of my personal favourites) and Ewan McGregor(Renton all time anti-hero) fan, this film just helps to remind me that no one is ever perfect.

    This is not a good film. It's enjoyable according to a number of things you can get from many other films. Conventional comedy values built around romantic stories. Escapism in recognizable form for anyone vaguely used to Hollywood. But this is a little bit more than that. It's part of a trilogy of films featuring a trilogy of interesting artists: Boyle/Hodge/McGregor. This set of films was important for it established the basis of 2 interesting and important careers (Hodge in the meanwhile seems to have deviated from interesting stuff, let's hope he comes back). What they did was what one might call experimentalism, or even theoretical experiments leaked onto practical products. Of the 3 films, this is probably the less interesting. It's not especially entertaining, and even as an experiment it's not especially interesting. The point was to pick up a specific genre, romantic comedy in this case, and twist it or at least give it a new edge. The result falls a lot behind what, say, the Coens did in Intolerable Cruelty. Still, McGregor would become a powerful actor, one of the best, and Boyle is always worthwhile no matter what he does, and he's done some impressive stuff since. So, this film becomes a sort of an historical artifact if you want to do archaeological research of their careers. What you learn here is that from the beginning Boyle trusts his intuition, and that vein prevails over how he rationalizes his film conceptions. Those intuitions may be really powerful or come to nothing (like here), but he's always willing to take the chance, and i appreciate him for that, i'll want to see anything from him. And you learn that McGregor, already back here was self-conscious as an actor. He knows he's acting, so the question is not so much to be "real" (as an obscene amount of actors always try to) but to deliver the acting while acknowledging it. That's probably the more fundamental theme of the art in the last century. As far as cinema acting goes, Ewan McGregor may be its state of art. But this film, unless you place it in the perspective of their makers future, is pretty much useless. My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

    The title of this movie intrigued me somehow and so I hired it. I thought it was funny and I am glad that I did hire it because I did quite enjoy it. The humour was actually quite decent humour and not the typical try-hard humour that most romantic comedies, as this is what A Life Less Ordinary is, tend to display. Now heaven is getting quite upset at the number of relationships that are falling apart so two angels are sent to Earth to bring two people together and if they don't then they cannot return. The two people are completely the opposite, which is typically American, and so the angels see it is basically an impossible task. One of them is a dreamer who works as a cleaner and wants to write trashy novels, while the other is the rich daughter of the guy's employer. The guy is sacked from his job and replaced with robots and then he looses his current girlfriend and is kicked out of home due to unpaid rent. He then, in frustration, barges into his bosses office with a gun and demands his job back. The daughter is simply lazy and a crack shot. A dentist wants to marry her but she is not interested so she decides to test him by shooting an apple off the top of his head. He moves and is hit in the head. She is then brought to her father and is told that she now has to work for his money. Now, she is in the office when he bursts in and he ends up kidnapping her, but it turns out that she knows more about kidnapping than he does so decides to teach him a few lessons. Well, this is how the movie turns out. Of course it is predictable as a romantic comedy as it is not a movie where both parties end up dead, as they do in Romeo and Juliet. In fact, Shakespeare actually wrote a lot of decent romantic comedies, but they are intelligent, unlike the garbage that is churned out of Hollywood these days. A Life Less Ordinary is not one of those garbage movies, though it doesn't really rise to the heights of a Shakespearian comedy. My really only complaint with the movie is how it deals with heaven. Basically God is not in control and sits away from everything letting the world run itself. Occasionally he sticks his hand in to make things run a little smoother but generally he doesn't care. Also, there is the idea that the rich go to heaven and the poor go to hell and there is no way out of that. Really that is just absolute garbage and shows how people seriously don't understand the way God operates. God doesn't judge us on wealth or on how good we've been. Rather he judges us on who we have given our life to. If we have told God to get lost then that is it, we don't want him then he doesn't want us. But if we ask God to be on our side, then he will take us as a friend and welcome us into eternity.

    I really loved this movie, it was well written, well directed, and well acted, and the icing on the cake is Cameron Diaz, she is quite the package, smoking hot with a great personality and is just awesome in this movie. Ewan McGregor is no slouch either, his high energy keeps the film moving at a nice steady pace. What really ties it together is a perfect sound track. The entire film is planted with mood enhancing songs that roll flawless with each scene. What I loved is how the director kept the film light, no overly heavy scenes, keeping it fun throughout the entire picture. Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo's characters were hilarious and I found myself constantly rooting for them. I would put this film in my top 20 favorite movies and I highly suggest watching it.

    I recently purchased ALLO having not seen it in a long time. I had fond memories of a number of scenes and the movie was really cheap in a second hand store. In the first hour all of the scenes I remembered popped up and I was thoroughly enjoying myself, whilst wondering why the film had a comparatively poor rating both with audiences and critics. The chemistry between the leads is good and there are a lot of funny moments as Ewan Macgregor's character struggles with his inability to be a bad guy and Cameron Diaz tries to manipulate the situation to meet her own ends. Holly Hunters playfully seductive angel is also perfect opposite Delroy Lindo. Unfortunately the bag swap comes about 40 minutes too early in the film and from here the wheels come off. We are given scene after scene, each one more ridiculous than the last, of the two would be lovers getting mad at each other. Although the fantastical elements of the film can be accepted, there is at least one scene where the inevitable repercussions cannot be ignored but are never addressed. For a film that has such a strong first half, the second half verges on boring. For me that's probably the worst thing that can be said of any movie. The soundtrack is no doubt great if you're playing the CD in the car. However the placing of the songs seems all wrong, like Boyle was simply trying to replicate what he had achieved in Trainspotting where the songs underlined the scenes perfectly. All in all, for me this was a typical Danny Boyle film (with the exception of Trainspotting). It promised so much yet was let down by some fatal flaws.

The guy is sacked from his job and replaced with robots and then he looses his current girlfriend and is kicked out of home due to unpaid rent. He then, in frustration, barges into his bosses office with a gun and demands his job back. The daughter is simply lazy and a crack shot. A dentist wants to marry her but she is not interested so she decides to test him by shooting an apple off the top of his head. He moves and is hit in the head. She is then brought to her father and is told that she now has to work for his money. Now, she is in the office when he bursts in and he ends up kidnapping her, but it turns out that she knows more about kidnapping than he does so decides to teach him a few lessons. Well, this is how the movie turns out. Of course it is predictable as a romantic comedy as it is not a movie where both parties end up dead, as they do in Romeo and Juliet. In fact, Shakespeare actually wrote a lot of decent romantic comedies, but they are intelligent, unlike the garbage that is churned out of Hollywood these days. A Life Less Ordinary is not one of those garbage movies, though it doesn't really rise to the heights of a Shakespearian comedy. My really only complaint with the movie is how it deals with heaven. Basically God is not in control and sits away from everything letting the world run itself. Occasionally he sticks his hand in to make things run a little smoother but generally he doesn't care. Also, there is the idea that the rich go to heaven and the poor go to hell and there is no way out of that. Really that is just absolute garbage and shows how people seriously don't understand the way God operates. God doesn't judge us on wealth or on how good we've been. Rather he judges us on who we have given our life to. If we have told God to get lost then that is it, we don't want him then he doesn't want us. But if we ask God to be on our side, then he will take us as a friend and welcome us into eternity.

    I really loved this movie, it was well written, well directed, and well acted, and the icing on the cake is Cameron Diaz, she is quite the package, smoking hot with a great personality and is just awesome in this movie. Ewan McGregor is no slouch either, his high energy keeps the film moving at a nice steady pace. What really ties it together is a perfect sound track. The entire film is planted with mood enhancing songs that roll flawless with each scene. What I loved is how the director kept the film light, no overly heavy scenes, keeping it fun throughout the entire picture. Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo's characters were hilarious and I found myself constantly rooting for them. I would put this film in my top 20 favorite movies and I highly suggest watching it.

    I recently purchased ALLO having not seen it in a long time. I had fond memories of a number of scenes and the movie was really cheap in a second hand store. In the first hour all of the scenes I remembered popped up and I was thoroughly enjoying myself, whilst wondering why the film had a comparatively poor rating both with audiences and critics. The chemistry between the leads is good and there are a lot of funny moments as Ewan Macgregor's character struggles with his inability to be a bad guy and Cameron Diaz tries to manipulate the situation to meet her own ends. Holly Hunters playfully seductive angel is also perfect opposite Delroy Lindo. Unfortunately the bag swap comes about 40 minutes too early in the film and from here the wheels come off. We are given scene after scene, each one more ridiculous than the last, of the two would be lovers getting mad at each other. Although the fantastical elements of the film can be accepted, there is at least one scene where the inevitable repercussions cannot be ignored but are never addressed. For a film that has such a strong first half, the second half verges on boring. For me that's probably the worst thing that can be said of any movie. The soundtrack is no doubt great if you're playing the CD in the car. However the placing of the songs seems all wrong, like Boyle was simply trying to replicate what he had achieved in Trainspotting where the songs underlined the scenes perfectly. All in all, for me this was a typical Danny Boyle film (with the exception of Trainspotting). It promised so much yet was let down by some fatal flaws.

    If the name of Danny Boyle is often synonym of success, the Englishman is also capable of directing more than mediocre movies such as this A Life Less Ordinary. It relies on a qualitatively low script. Everything is convenient, clich&eacute;, the plot unfolds really too linearly and is in the end little interesting. The fantastic touch, more boring than anything, doesn't help either. The Diaz-McGregor works difficultly and struggles to extricate itself from this mess where characters and situations are stereotyped. Even the direction is uninspired, not to mention the soundtrack that is almost ridiculous, which is a shame when speaking of Boyle. It is maybe the worst feature of the director, along with Millions, both movies sharing as a matter of fact the same mystical tone.

    After rising to directorial fame with the very European Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle decided to live a little and make his own American road movie A Life Less Ordinary. The film is the third collaboration between Boyle and actor Ewan McGregor. This time around McGregor plays Robert Lewis, a janitor for a large company who gets fired and replaced by a robot. In order to get back at the company he kidnaps the CEO's daughter, Cameron Diaz. An unlikely relationship develops between the kidnapper and kidnapee, a relationship helped along by two "angels" who are in charge of matchmaking human beings on Earth. It's a quirky romantic comedy with an unexpectedly violent streak running down the middle. It's hard to comprehend exactly what this movie is trying to accomplish. It's romantic but not exactly touching. It's comedic without being overtly hilarious. It's eccentric and violent without feeling like an exploitation film. This weird mix of clashing genres actually does the film some good though, as it really is a lot of fun. It's strange, it's offbeat, and it's plenty entertaining from start to finish. It's got that Danny Boyle style that courses so strong through the auteur's veins. Of course you can't expect Trainspotting from it because A Life Less Ordinary is substantially watered down, and doesn't have the kind of human element we see in a dark character study like Trainspotting. The story is nothing special, but it's fun and it serves its purpose. Again, I'm not sure what the point of A Life Less Ordinary is, but neither do I really care. Boyle has himself a fun little film here with enough quirkiness to keep it lively and interesting for an hour and 42 minutes.

    a life less ordinary is one of those movies that just misses the mark.... which is a shame, because it has the potential to be a really good movie. first, the fantasy sequences are not needed, they fall flat, just aren't done well and don't add anything to the movie. the director could learn a lesson from the coehn brothers on how to successfully use fantasy sequences. the whole angel premise is also not needed and just seems really contrived and just gets in the way and muddles everything up. cameron diaz and ewan mcgregor's performances and chemistry are excellent, as are the rest of the performances from the eccentric secondary cast. the scene play is way too all over the place and does not keep you on the edge of your seat, instead i found my mind wandering, thinking to myself, what a job the coehn brothers could have done with this material and actors. oh well, nice try, but i can't recommend this movie other then for the performances of the actors.

    OK you have to loose yourself a little in it. It's still a fairy tale. It involves angels coming down from heaven. Don't expect something believable and you might just enjoy this. Personally, I'm an atheist and this is one of my favourite movies of all time. Expect all the usual Danny Boyle trimmings that he's since become renowned for. Awesome cast, stunningly shot and, of course, a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Faithless, Ash, Beck and REM. Was one of his first big screen director roles. He is quoted as saying it's one of his favourite that he directed. As it isn't one of the movies that people naturally think of when they think of his work. Give it a go. But do it with an open mind prepared to embrace an element of fairy-tale and you'll probably enjoy it.

    I have to admit that for some time now I have been a bit of a fan of the work of Danny Boyle. As such, I'm made it a bit of a mission to take a look at as much of his back catalogue as I can whenever they are shown on TV. So this is how I came to watch this one. I have to say it's not the best film I've seen associated with his name, but it's passable. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary. We start in heaven (where else), where two angels, O'Reilly and Jackson, are given their last chance to, let's say, facilitate a couple falling in love. It's a tough case; two people from very different backgrounds. First there's Robert Lewis who's a cleaner (& a writer in his spare time) who has just lost his job and been dumped by his girlfriend. Then there's Celine Naville a rich socialite whose father wants her to go to work for him. They are thrown together when Robert goes to see Celine's father to demand his job back and things go slightly wrong. He ends up kidnapping Celine and taking her to a cabin in the wilderness. He really doesn't have a clue and Celine ends up taking the lead; deciding she may as well try to get some money out of her father. Meanwhile, O'Reilly and Jackson are hired by Celine's father to find them. As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated already and we're only part-way through! I'll leave it there though or the Spoiler Police (confusing plots division) will have me kidnapped in amusing circumstances (again). A well made film that has the beginnings many of the hallmarks of Boyle's latter works. Some interesting ideas thrown in, some that worked and some that didn't, but then I see it as a bit of a stepping stone for Boyle. Nice performances all round; Ewan McGregor did a decent job as Robert Lewis, although his haircut is pretty bizarre! Cameron Diaz did a great job as Celine; it's the kind of role she's pretty comfortable in. I thought both Holly Hunter as O'Reilly and Delroy Lindo as Jackson were excellent. Honourable mentions must also go to; Ian McNeice as Mayhew, Frank Kanig as Ted, Stanley Tucci as Elliot Zweikel, Tony Shalhoub as Al and Ian Holm as Naville (Celine's father). Although I'm a fan of Danny Boyle's work, I'm afraid this one failed to hit the mark (for me). I found the plot far too over-complicated, almost like they were trying to fit far too many ideas in all at once. To me it would have been much more interesting to see the story from the point of view of O'Reilly and Jackson, but then I guess I'm not a screenwriter (yet). Yes, there were some nice touches, for instance, I loved the song and dance routine in the bar; very funny. Over all though, it's one I'll have to sit on the fence as far as recommendation goes; it's kind of in the middle there somewhere. My score: 5.7/10 IMDb Score: 6.3/10 (based on 20,915 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 39/100 (based on 36 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 56/100 (based on 52,726 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    I saw this film in theatres when it had just come out, much abuzz about both Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz. While not wholly disappointed by the film, I was left stunned. Two days prior to seeing this I had just watched on television Two of a Kind with John Travolta and Olivia Newton John. I had read reviews saying this was an original story(ALLO) and a breath of fresh air. This is not so, I urge you to read the summary for Two of a Kind(don't see the film unless you like 80's garbage films) and see if the 2 contrast(they don't). While I'm all for a well scripted and acted romantic comedy, don't profess originality unless you know it to be so. I am still a huge Danny Boyle(Sunsine one of my personal favourites) and Ewan McGregor(Renton all time anti-hero) fan, this film just helps to remind me that no one is ever perfect.

    This is not a good film. It's enjoyable according to a number of things you can get from many other films. Conventional comedy values built around romantic stories. Escapism in recognizable form for anyone vaguely used to Hollywood. But this is a little bit more than that. It's part of a trilogy of films featuring a trilogy of interesting artists: Boyle/Hodge/McGregor. This set of films was important for it established the basis of 2 interesting and important careers (Hodge in the meanwhile seems to have deviated from interesting stuff, let's hope he comes back). What they did was what one might call experimentalism, or even theoretical experiments leaked onto practical products. Of the 3 films, this is probably the less interesting. It's not especially entertaining, and even as an experiment it's not especially interesting. The point was to pick up a specific genre, romantic comedy in this case, and twist it or at least give it a new edge. The result falls a lot behind what, say, the Coens did in Intolerable Cruelty. Still, McGregor would become a powerful actor, one of the best, and Boyle is always worthwhile no matter what he does, and he's done some impressive stuff since. So, this film becomes a sort of an historical artifact if you want to do archaeological research of their careers. What you learn here is that from the beginning Boyle trusts his intuition, and that vein prevails over how he rationalizes his film conceptions. Those intuitions may be really powerful or come to nothing (like here), but he's always willing to take the chance, and i appreciate him for that, i'll want to see anything from him. And you learn that McGregor, already back here was self-conscious as an actor. He knows he's acting, so the question is not so much to be "real" (as an obscene amount of actors always try to) but to deliver the acting while acknowledging it. That's probably the more fundamental theme of the art in the last century. As far as cinema acting goes, Ewan McGregor may be its state of art. But this film, unless you place it in the perspective of their makers future, is pretty much useless. My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

    The title of this movie intrigued me somehow and so I hired it. I thought it was funny and I am glad that I did hire it because I did quite enjoy it. The humour was actually quite decent humour and not the typical try-hard humour that most romantic comedies, as this is what A Life Less Ordinary is, tend to display. Now heaven is getting quite upset at the number of relationships that are falling apart so two angels are sent to Earth to bring two people together and if they don't then they cannot return. The two people are completely the opposite, which is typically American, and so the angels see it is basically an impossible task. One of them is a dreamer who works as a cleaner and wants to write trashy novels, while the other is the rich daughter of the guy's employer. The guy is sacked from his job and replaced with robots and then he looses his current girlfriend and is kicked out of home due to unpaid rent. He then, in frustration, barges into his bosses office with a gun and demands his job back. The daughter is simply lazy and a crack shot. A dentist wants to marry her but she is not interested so she decides to test him by shooting an apple off the top of his head. He moves and is hit in the head. She is then brought to her father and is told that she now has to work for his money. Now, she is in the office when he bursts in and he ends up kidnapping her, but it turns out that she knows more about kidnapping than he does so decides to teach him a few lessons.

Rather he judges us on who we have given our life to. If we have told God to get lost then that is it, we don't want him then he doesn't want us. But if we ask God to be on our side, then he will take us as a friend and welcome us into eternity.

Over all though, it's one I'll have to sit on the fence as far as recommendation goes; it's kind of in the middle there somewhere. My score: 5.7/10 IMDb Score: 6.3/10 (based on 20,915 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 39/100 (based on 36 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 56/100 (based on 52,726 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    I saw this film in theatres when it had just come out, much abuzz about both Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz. While not wholly disappointed by the film, I was left stunned. Two days prior to seeing this I had just watched on television Two of a Kind with John Travolta and Olivia Newton John. I had read reviews saying this was an original story(ALLO) and a breath of fresh air. This is not so, I urge you to read the summary for Two of a Kind(don't see the film unless you like 80's garbage films) and see if the 2 contrast(they don't). While I'm all for a well scripted and acted romantic comedy, don't profess originality unless you know it to be so. I am still a huge Danny Boyle(Sunsine one of my personal favourites) and Ewan McGregor(Renton all time anti-hero) fan, this film just helps to remind me that no one is ever perfect.

    This is not a good film. It's enjoyable according to a number of things you can get from many other films. Conventional comedy values built around romantic stories. Escapism in recognizable form for anyone vaguely used to Hollywood. But this is a little bit more than that. It's part of a trilogy of films featuring a trilogy of interesting artists: Boyle/Hodge/McGregor. This set of films was important for it established the basis of 2 interesting and important careers (Hodge in the meanwhile seems to have deviated from interesting stuff, let's hope he comes back). What they did was what one might call experimentalism, or even theoretical experiments leaked onto practical products. Of the 3 films, this is probably the less interesting. It's not especially entertaining, and even as an experiment it's not especially interesting. The point was to pick up a specific genre, romantic comedy in this case, and twist it or at least give it a new edge. The result falls a lot behind what, say, the Coens did in Intolerable Cruelty. Still, McGregor would become a powerful actor, one of the best, and Boyle is always worthwhile no matter what he does, and he's done some impressive stuff since. So, this film becomes a sort of an historical artifact if you want to do archaeological research of their careers. What you learn here is that from the beginning Boyle trusts his intuition, and that vein prevails over how he rationalizes his film conceptions. Those intuitions may be really powerful or come to nothing (like here), but he's always willing to take the chance, and i appreciate him for that, i'll want to see anything from him. And you learn that McGregor, already back here was self-conscious as an actor. He knows he's acting, so the question is not so much to be "real" (as an obscene amount of actors always try to) but to deliver the acting while acknowledging it. That's probably the more fundamental theme of the art in the last century. As far as cinema acting goes, Ewan McGregor may be its state of art. But this film, unless you place it in the perspective of their makers future, is pretty much useless. My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

    The title of this movie intrigued me somehow and so I hired it. I thought it was funny and I am glad that I did hire it because I did quite enjoy it. The humour was actually quite decent humour and not the typical try-hard humour that most romantic comedies, as this is what A Life Less Ordinary is, tend to display. Now heaven is getting quite upset at the number of relationships that are falling apart so two angels are sent to Earth to bring two people together and if they don't then they cannot return. The two people are completely the opposite, which is typically American, and so the angels see it is basically an impossible task. One of them is a dreamer who works as a cleaner and wants to write trashy novels, while the other is the rich daughter of the guy's employer. The guy is sacked from his job and replaced with robots and then he looses his current girlfriend and is kicked out of home due to unpaid rent. He then, in frustration, barges into his bosses office with a gun and demands his job back. The daughter is simply lazy and a crack shot. A dentist wants to marry her but she is not interested so she decides to test him by shooting an apple off the top of his head. He moves and is hit in the head. She is then brought to her father and is told that she now has to work for his money. Now, she is in the office when he bursts in and he ends up kidnapping her, but it turns out that she knows more about kidnapping than he does so decides to teach him a few lessons. Well, this is how the movie turns out. Of course it is predictable as a romantic comedy as it is not a movie where both parties end up dead, as they do in Romeo and Juliet. In fact, Shakespeare actually wrote a lot of decent romantic comedies, but they are intelligent, unlike the garbage that is churned out of Hollywood these days. A Life Less Ordinary is not one of those garbage movies, though it doesn't really rise to the heights of a Shakespearian comedy. My really only complaint with the movie is how it deals with heaven. Basically God is not in control and sits away from everything letting the world run itself. Occasionally he sticks his hand in to make things run a little smoother but generally he doesn't care. Also, there is the idea that the rich go to heaven and the poor go to hell and there is no way out of that. Really that is just absolute garbage and shows how people seriously don't understand the way God operates. God doesn't judge us on wealth or on how good we've been. Rather he judges us on who we have given our life to. If we have told God to get lost then that is it, we don't want him then he doesn't want us. But if we ask God to be on our side, then he will take us as a friend and welcome us into eternity.

    I really loved this movie, it was well written, well directed, and well acted, and the icing on the cake is Cameron Diaz, she is quite the package, smoking hot with a great personality and is just awesome in this movie. Ewan McGregor is no slouch either, his high energy keeps the film moving at a nice steady pace. What really ties it together is a perfect sound track. The entire film is planted with mood enhancing songs that roll flawless with each scene. What I loved is how the director kept the film light, no overly heavy scenes, keeping it fun throughout the entire picture. Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo's characters were hilarious and I found myself constantly rooting for them. I would put this film in my top 20 favorite movies and I highly suggest watching it.

    I recently purchased ALLO having not seen it in a long time. I had fond memories of a number of scenes and the movie was really cheap in a second hand store. In the first hour all of the scenes I remembered popped up and I was thoroughly enjoying myself, whilst wondering why the film had a comparatively poor rating both with audiences and critics. The chemistry between the leads is good and there are a lot of funny moments as Ewan Macgregor's character struggles with his inability to be a bad guy and Cameron Diaz tries to manipulate the situation to meet her own ends. Holly Hunters playfully seductive angel is also perfect opposite Delroy Lindo. Unfortunately the bag swap comes about 40 minutes too early in the film and from here the wheels come off. We are given scene after scene, each one more ridiculous than the last, of the two would be lovers getting mad at each other. Although the fantastical elements of the film can be accepted, there is at least one scene where the inevitable repercussions cannot be ignored but are never addressed. For a film that has such a strong first half, the second half verges on boring. For me that's probably the worst thing that can be said of any movie. The soundtrack is no doubt great if you're playing the CD in the car. However the placing of the songs seems all wrong, like Boyle was simply trying to replicate what he had achieved in Trainspotting where the songs underlined the scenes perfectly. All in all, for me this was a typical Danny Boyle film (with the exception of Trainspotting). It promised so much yet was let down by some fatal flaws.

    If the name of Danny Boyle is often synonym of success, the Englishman is also capable of directing more than mediocre movies such as this A Life Less Ordinary. It relies on a qualitatively low script. Everything is convenient, clich&eacute;, the plot unfolds really too linearly and is in the end little interesting. The fantastic touch, more boring than anything, doesn't help either. The Diaz-McGregor works difficultly and struggles to extricate itself from this mess where characters and situations are stereotyped. Even the direction is uninspired, not to mention the soundtrack that is almost ridiculous, which is a shame when speaking of Boyle. It is maybe the worst feature of the director, along with Millions, both movies sharing as a matter of fact the same mystical tone.

    After rising to directorial fame with the very European Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle decided to live a little and make his own American road movie A Life Less Ordinary. The film is the third collaboration between Boyle and actor Ewan McGregor. This time around McGregor plays Robert Lewis, a janitor for a large company who gets fired and replaced by a robot. In order to get back at the company he kidnaps the CEO's daughter, Cameron Diaz. An unlikely relationship develops between the kidnapper and kidnapee, a relationship helped along by two "angels" who are in charge of matchmaking human beings on Earth. It's a quirky romantic comedy with an unexpectedly violent streak running down the middle. It's hard to comprehend exactly what this movie is trying to accomplish. It's romantic but not exactly touching. It's comedic without being overtly hilarious. It's eccentric and violent without feeling like an exploitation film. This weird mix of clashing genres actually does the film some good though, as it really is a lot of fun. It's strange, it's offbeat, and it's plenty entertaining from start to finish. It's got that Danny Boyle style that courses so strong through the auteur's veins. Of course you can't expect Trainspotting from it because A Life Less Ordinary is substantially watered down, and doesn't have the kind of human element we see in a dark character study like Trainspotting. The story is nothing special, but it's fun and it serves its purpose. Again, I'm not sure what the point of A Life Less Ordinary is, but neither do I really care. Boyle has himself a fun little film here with enough quirkiness to keep it lively and interesting for an hour and 42 minutes.

    a life less ordinary is one of those movies that just misses the mark.... which is a shame, because it has the potential to be a really good movie. first, the fantasy sequences are not needed, they fall flat, just aren't done well and don't add anything to the movie. the director could learn a lesson from the coehn brothers on how to successfully use fantasy sequences. the whole angel premise is also not needed and just seems really contrived and just gets in the way and muddles everything up. cameron diaz and ewan mcgregor's performances and chemistry are excellent, as are the rest of the performances from the eccentric secondary cast. the scene play is way too all over the place and does not keep you on the edge of your seat, instead i found my mind wandering, thinking to myself, what a job the coehn brothers could have done with this material and actors. oh well, nice try, but i can't recommend this movie other then for the performances of the actors.

    OK you have to loose yourself a little in it. It's still a fairy tale. It involves angels coming down from heaven. Don't expect something believable and you might just enjoy this. Personally, I'm an atheist and this is one of my favourite movies of all time. Expect all the usual Danny Boyle trimmings that he's since become renowned for. Awesome cast, stunningly shot and, of course, a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Faithless, Ash, Beck and REM. Was one of his first big screen director roles. He is quoted as saying it's one of his favourite that he directed. As it isn't one of the movies that people naturally think of when they think of his work. Give it a go. But do it with an open mind prepared to embrace an element of fairy-tale and you'll probably enjoy it.

    I have to admit that for some time now I have been a bit of a fan of the work of Danny Boyle. As such, I'm made it a bit of a mission to take a look at as much of his back catalogue as I can whenever they are shown on TV. So this is how I came to watch this one. I have to say it's not the best film I've seen associated with his name, but it's passable. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary. We start in heaven (where else), where two angels, O'Reilly and Jackson, are given their last chance to, let's say, facilitate a couple falling in love. It's a tough case; two people from very different backgrounds. First there's Robert Lewis who's a cleaner (& a writer in his spare time) who has just lost his job and been dumped by his girlfriend. Then there's Celine Naville a rich socialite whose father wants her to go to work for him. They are thrown together when Robert goes to see Celine's father to demand his job back and things go slightly wrong. He ends up kidnapping Celine and taking her to a cabin in the wilderness. He really doesn't have a clue and Celine ends up taking the lead; deciding she may as well try to get some money out of her father. Meanwhile, O'Reilly and Jackson are hired by Celine's father to find them. As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated already and we're only part-way through! I'll leave it there though or the Spoiler Police (confusing plots division) will have me kidnapped in amusing circumstances (again). A well made film that has the beginnings many of the hallmarks of Boyle's latter works. Some interesting ideas thrown in, some that worked and some that didn't, but then I see it as a bit of a stepping stone for Boyle. Nice performances all round; Ewan McGregor did a decent job as Robert Lewis, although his haircut is pretty bizarre! Cameron Diaz did a great job as Celine; it's the kind of role she's pretty comfortable in. I thought both Holly Hunter as O'Reilly and Delroy Lindo as Jackson were excellent. Honourable mentions must also go to; Ian McNeice as Mayhew, Frank Kanig as Ted, Stanley Tucci as Elliot Zweikel, Tony Shalhoub as Al and Ian Holm as Naville (Celine's father). Although I'm a fan of Danny Boyle's work, I'm afraid this one failed to hit the mark (for me). I found the plot far too over-complicated, almost like they were trying to fit far too many ideas in all at once. To me it would have been much more interesting to see the story from the point of view of O'Reilly and Jackson, but then I guess I'm not a screenwriter (yet). Yes, there were some nice touches, for instance, I loved the song and dance routine in the bar; very funny. Over all though, it's one I'll have to sit on the fence as far as recommendation goes; it's kind of in the middle there somewhere. My score: 5.7/10 IMDb Score: 6.3/10 (based on 20,915 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 39/100 (based on 36 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 56/100 (based on 52,726 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    a life less ordinary is one of those movies that just misses the mark.... which is a shame, because it has the potential to be a really good movie. first, the fantasy sequences are not needed, they fall flat, just aren't done well and don't add anything to the movie. the director could learn a lesson from the coehn brothers on how to successfully use fantasy sequences. the whole angel premise is also not needed and just seems really contrived and just gets in the way and muddles everything up. cameron diaz and ewan mcgregor's performances and chemistry are excellent, as are the rest of the performances from the eccentric secondary cast. the scene play is way too all over the place and does not keep you on the edge of your seat, instead i found my mind wandering, thinking to myself, what a job the coehn brothers could have done with this material and actors. oh well, nice try, but i can't recommend this movie other then for the performances of the actors.

    OK you have to loose yourself a little in it. It's still a fairy tale. It involves angels coming down from heaven. Don't expect something believable and you might just enjoy this. Personally, I'm an atheist and this is one of my favourite movies of all time. Expect all the usual Danny Boyle trimmings that he's since become renowned for. Awesome cast, stunningly shot and, of course, a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Faithless, Ash, Beck and REM. Was one of his first big screen director roles. He is quoted as saying it's one of his favourite that he directed. As it isn't one of the movies that people naturally think of when they think of his work. Give it a go. But do it with an open mind prepared to embrace an element of fairy-tale and you'll probably enjoy it.

    I have to admit that for some time now I have been a bit of a fan of the work of Danny Boyle. As such, I'm made it a bit of a mission to take a look at as much of his back catalogue as I can whenever they are shown on TV. So this is how I came to watch this one. I have to say it's not the best film I've seen associated with his name, but it's passable. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary. We start in heaven (where else), where two angels, O'Reilly and Jackson, are given their last chance to, let's say, facilitate a couple falling in love. It's a tough case; two people from very different backgrounds. First there's Robert Lewis who's a cleaner (& a writer in his spare time) who has just lost his job and been dumped by his girlfriend. Then there's Celine Naville a rich socialite whose father wants her to go to work for him. They are thrown together when Robert goes to see Celine's father to demand his job back and things go slightly wrong. He ends up kidnapping Celine and taking her to a cabin in the wilderness. He really doesn't have a clue and Celine ends up taking the lead; deciding she may as well try to get some money out of her father. Meanwhile, O'Reilly and Jackson are hired by Celine's father to find them. As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated already and we're only part-way through! I'll leave it there though or the Spoiler Police (confusing plots division) will have me kidnapped in amusing circumstances (again). A well made film that has the beginnings many of the hallmarks of Boyle's latter works. Some interesting ideas thrown in, some that worked and some that didn't, but then I see it as a bit of a stepping stone for Boyle. Nice performances all round; Ewan McGregor did a decent job as Robert Lewis, although his haircut is pretty bizarre! Cameron Diaz did a great job as Celine; it's the kind of role she's pretty comfortable in. I thought both Holly Hunter as O'Reilly and Delroy Lindo as Jackson were excellent. Honourable mentions must also go to; Ian McNeice as Mayhew, Frank Kanig as Ted, Stanley Tucci as Elliot Zweikel, Tony Shalhoub as Al and Ian Holm as Naville (Celine's father). Although I'm a fan of Danny Boyle's work, I'm afraid this one failed to hit the mark (for me). I found the plot far too over-complicated, almost like they were trying to fit far too many ideas in all at once. To me it would have been much more interesting to see the story from the point of view of O'Reilly and Jackson, but then I guess I'm not a screenwriter (yet). Yes, there were some nice touches, for instance, I loved the song and dance routine in the bar; very funny. Over all though, it's one I'll have to sit on the fence as far as recommendation goes; it's kind of in the middle there somewhere. My score: 5.7/10 IMDb Score: 6.3/10 (based on 20,915 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 39/100 (based on 36 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 56/100 (based on 52,726 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    I saw this film in theatres when it had just come out, much abuzz about both Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz. While not wholly disappointed by the film, I was left stunned. Two days prior to seeing this I had just watched on television Two of a Kind with John Travolta and Olivia Newton John. I had read reviews saying this was an original story(ALLO) and a breath of fresh air. This is not so, I urge you to read the summary for Two of a Kind(don't see the film unless you like 80's garbage films) and see if the 2 contrast(they don't). While I'm all for a well scripted and acted romantic comedy, don't profess originality unless you know it to be so. I am still a huge Danny Boyle(Sunsine one of my personal favourites) and Ewan McGregor(Renton all time anti-hero) fan, this film just helps to remind me that no one is ever perfect.

    This is not a good film. It's enjoyable according to a number of things you can get from many other films. Conventional comedy values built around romantic stories. Escapism in recognizable form for anyone vaguely used to Hollywood. But this is a little bit more than that. It's part of a trilogy of films featuring a trilogy of interesting artists: Boyle/Hodge/McGregor. This set of films was important for it established the basis of 2 interesting and important careers (Hodge in the meanwhile seems to have deviated from interesting stuff, let's hope he comes back). What they did was what one might call experimentalism, or even theoretical experiments leaked onto practical products. Of the 3 films, this is probably the less interesting. It's not especially entertaining, and even as an experiment it's not especially interesting. The point was to pick up a specific genre, romantic comedy in this case, and twist it or at least give it a new edge. The result falls a lot behind what, say, the Coens did in Intolerable Cruelty. Still, McGregor would become a powerful actor, one of the best, and Boyle is always worthwhile no matter what he does, and he's done some impressive stuff since. So, this film becomes a sort of an historical artifact if you want to do archaeological research of their careers. What you learn here is that from the beginning Boyle trusts his intuition, and that vein prevails over how he rationalizes his film conceptions. Those intuitions may be really powerful or come to nothing (like here), but he's always willing to take the chance, and i appreciate him for that, i'll want to see anything from him. And you learn that McGregor, already back here was self-conscious as an actor. He knows he's acting, so the question is not so much to be "real" (as an obscene amount of actors always try to) but to deliver the acting while acknowledging it. That's probably the more fundamental theme of the art in the last century. As far as cinema acting goes, Ewan McGregor may be its state of art. But this film, unless you place it in the perspective of their makers future, is pretty much useless. My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com

    The title of this movie intrigued me somehow and so I hired it. I thought it was funny and I am glad that I did hire it because I did quite enjoy it. The humour was actually quite decent humour and not the typical try-hard humour that most romantic comedies, as this is what A Life Less Ordinary is, tend to display. Now heaven is getting quite upset at the number of relationships that are falling apart so two angels are sent to Earth to bring two people together and if they don't then they cannot return. The two people are completely the opposite, which is typically American, and so the angels see it is basically an impossible task. One of them is a dreamer who works as a cleaner and wants to write trashy novels, while the other is the rich daughter of the guy's employer. The guy is sacked from his job and replaced with robots and then he looses his current girlfriend and is kicked out of home due to unpaid rent. He then, in frustration, barges into his bosses office with a gun and demands his job back. The daughter is simply lazy and a crack shot. A dentist wants to marry her but she is not interested so she decides to test him by shooting an apple off the top of his head. He moves and is hit in the head. She is then brought to her father and is told that she now has to work for his money. Now, she is in the office when he bursts in and he ends up kidnapping her, but it turns out that she knows more about kidnapping than he does so decides to teach him a few lessons. Well, this is how the movie turns out. Of course it is predictable as a romantic comedy as it is not a movie where both parties end up dead, as they do in Romeo and Juliet. In fact, Shakespeare actually wrote a lot of decent romantic comedies, but they are intelligent, unlike the garbage that is churned out of Hollywood these days. A Life Less Ordinary is not one of those garbage movies, though it doesn't really rise to the heights of a Shakespearian comedy. My really only complaint with the movie is how it deals with heaven. Basically God is not in control and sits away from everything letting the world run itself. Occasionally he sticks his hand in to make things run a little smoother but generally he doesn't care. Also, there is the idea that the rich go to heaven and the poor go to hell and there is no way out of that. Really that is just absolute garbage and shows how people seriously don't understand the way God operates. God doesn't judge us on wealth or on how good we've been. Rather he judges us on who we have given our life to. If we have told God to get lost then that is it, we don't want him then he doesn't want us. But if we ask God to be on our side, then he will take us as a friend and welcome us into eternity.

    I really loved this movie, it was well written, well directed, and well acted, and the icing on the cake is Cameron Diaz, she is quite the package, smoking hot with a great personality and is just awesome in this movie. Ewan McGregor is no slouch either, his high energy keeps the film moving at a nice steady pace. What really ties it together is a perfect sound track. The entire film is planted with mood enhancing songs that roll flawless with each scene. What I loved is how the director kept the film light, no overly heavy scenes, keeping it fun throughout the entire picture. Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo's characters were hilarious and I found myself constantly rooting for them. I would put this film in my top 20 favorite movies and I highly suggest watching it.

    I recently purchased ALLO having not seen it in a long time. I had fond memories of a number of scenes and the movie was really cheap in a second hand store. In the first hour all of the scenes I remembered popped up and I was thoroughly enjoying myself, whilst wondering why the film had a comparatively poor rating both with audiences and critics. The chemistry between the leads is good and there are a lot of funny moments as Ewan Macgregor's character struggles with his inability to be a bad guy and Cameron Diaz tries to manipulate the situation to meet her own ends. Holly Hunters playfully seductive angel is also perfect opposite Delroy Lindo. Unfortunately the bag swap comes about 40 minutes too early in the film and from here the wheels come off. We are given scene after scene, each one more ridiculous than the last, of the two would be lovers getting mad at each other. Although the fantastical elements of the film can be accepted, there is at least one scene where the inevitable repercussions cannot be ignored but are never addressed. For a film that has such a strong first half, the second half verges on boring. For me that's probably the worst thing that can be said of any movie. The soundtrack is no doubt great if you're playing the CD in the car. However the placing of the songs seems all wrong, like Boyle was simply trying to replicate what he had achieved in Trainspotting where the songs underlined the scenes perfectly. All in all, for me this was a typical Danny Boyle film (with the exception of Trainspotting). It promised so much yet was let down by some fatal flaws.

    If the name of Danny Boyle is often synonym of success, the Englishman is also capable of directing more than mediocre movies such as this A Life Less Ordinary. It relies on a qualitatively low script. Everything is convenient, clich&eacute;, the plot unfolds really too linearly and is in the end little interesting. The fantastic touch, more boring than anything, doesn't help either. The Diaz-McGregor works difficultly and struggles to extricate itself from this mess where characters and situations are stereotyped. Even the direction is uninspired, not to mention the soundtrack that is almost ridiculous, which is a shame when speaking of Boyle. It is maybe the worst feature of the director, along with Millions, both movies sharing as a matter of fact the same mystical tone.

    After rising to directorial fame with the very European Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle decided to live a little and make his own American road movie A Life Less Ordinary. The film is the third collaboration between Boyle and actor Ewan McGregor. This time around McGregor plays Robert Lewis, a janitor for a large company who gets fired and replaced by a robot. In order to get back at the company he kidnaps the CEO's daughter, Cameron Diaz. An unlikely relationship develops between the kidnapper and kidnapee, a relationship helped along by two "angels" who are in charge of matchmaking human beings on Earth. It's a quirky romantic comedy with an unexpectedly violent streak running down the middle. It's hard to comprehend exactly what this movie is trying to accomplish. It's romantic but not exactly touching. It's comedic without being overtly hilarious. It's eccentric and violent without feeling like an exploitation film. This weird mix of clashing genres actually does the film some good though, as it really is a lot of fun. It's strange, it's offbeat, and it's plenty entertaining from start to finish. It's got that Danny Boyle style that courses so strong through the auteur's veins. Of course you can't expect Trainspotting from it because A Life Less Ordinary is substantially watered down, and doesn't have the kind of human element we see in a dark character study like Trainspotting. The story is nothing special, but it's fun and it serves its purpose. Again, I'm not sure what the point of A Life Less Ordinary is, but neither do I really care. Boyle has himself a fun little film here with enough quirkiness to keep it lively and interesting for an hour and 42 minutes.
