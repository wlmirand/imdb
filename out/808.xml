 <sinopse>
  Several players from different backgrounds try to cope with the pressures of playing football at a major university. Each deals with the pressure differently, some turn to drinking, others to drugs, and some to studying.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A college football coach is told by his bosses that unless they do better this season it could be his last. To bolster the team he recruits a talented wide receiver. A female student is assigned to help him assimilate with college life and that includes doing his studies because he spent his whole life just playing football. And he finds himself attracted to her and she already has a boyfriend who is also on the team but he might be more concern about losing his position than losing her to him. And the coach has to deal with his other players' situations like the team's quarterback who deals with his father being distant by drinking and it eventually gets him in trouble. And one of the team's defensive players is obviously using steroids but passes the drug tests.

    This movie was nothing short of shocking when it came out in 1993. The average person had a hard time believing the things depicted were based on actual accounts in colleges across the country. It wasn't until 20/20 reminded people of various scandals in college football (the 77-87 SMU mustangs are the perfect example of this movie) that the American public saw just how far players and schools will go to win. I still look at this movie with some sadness. You see how a player is treated with kid gloves when they are All-Americans, and when they are injured permanently and are of no use to the team, they are chewed up and spit out and quickly forgotten. Some ask for it, while others fall victims to their universities demands to push it to the limit and beyond! All in all, this is a very entertaining movie.

    You do not have to be a great fan of college football to appreciate this film but I suspect watching it might offer you a change to become a fan. Visually, the movie is quite lovely. It has a lush warm tone that is unaffected but effective. I like this film. I like the story. I like the way the film is executed. I find the story and characters credible and interesting. The contrast of themes or counterpoint of themes works well. The then young actors seem realistic. They are multidimensional. In fact, this is one of the best football movies. Dialogue is playful intelligent, and perceptive. The film uses multiple points-of-view and varies them in interesting ways. There are subjective reaction shots and asides that give the narrative great interest. I love the helmet camera images.

    OK ladies this movie, is about football. No its about the Program, yeah the program. I was scratching my head recently trying to remember this movie which i thought may have had Cuba Gooding JR in it about football. These two scenes kept playing out in my head, one was of a bunch of guys on the yellow line in the middle of a two lane street lying down head to foot while cars rushed by. The other was of this guy head-butting car windows. Well thats all i had to go on and after much scouring i found the movie the same place i always do. In a thrift store for a dollar! So i run home and toss it in waiting to see this part with the team on the ground in the street, and its not there. Apparently life imitates art and people who saw the original screening took to the streets and lay down in traffic. Some people died and plenty were hurt in a scarring prospect that left filmmakers to delete, and destroy the negative. I actually thought the movie was pretty good sides that and the head-butting scene is totally in tact. I wonder how many people head-butted cars after this? Or did steroids, this movie has an odd charm. I only played pop warner so i don't know if this is an accurate portrayal of college football, but really does it matter? were not exactly talking about portraying Jesus Christ here, its football and despite the name feet are mostly used just for running. Bunch of up and comers and well established actors and actresses in this one. Done well, it was worth the dollar, but in all honesty it was good. Seven thumbs.

    This is the best football movie ever made. It doesn't have all the clich&eacute;s that normal football movies have where the starting quarterback gets the beautiful cheerleader and any certain game is won at the buzzer on some totally bizarre play. It's about the truth of what goes on in the college game. Sure, this stuff doesn't happen everywhere, but it certain frickin' happens. I'm talking about the steroids, the football players being allowed a free pass when it comes to academics, the fact that some people cannot even read but are able to go to college just to play a damn game. This movie shows it all. James Caan does a perfect job of playing the coach trying to keep it all together. Although he is corrupted just as much as his players, he had his own problems to worry about with losing his job so he had a big balancing act to perform. This movie was NOT about triumph, it's about tragedy and sacrifice that young men make just to be a top player in a sport which in the long run normally doesn't amount to anything. Great watch for you people who don't know much about the "behind the scenes" stuff and if you haven't seen this movie and are interested in college football, check it out. It's not necessarily a greatly acted movie, but it's a very telling movie which more people should pay attention to. 7 out of 10 in my book for what it's worth.

    Great college football film. The cast clicked and the direction was outstanding. This film takes you behind the scenes as to what goes on in College Football. The politics, the drugs, the drinking, the pressure involved, and just the work ethic and what it takes to be a good Football team. Great value as far as the locations, the football games seemed so real, with the crowds, very convincing movie. I loved it all the way around. If people dislike this movie, it is probably due to wishing their doing better things with their lives. I agree with a comment, this is one of the best football films of the 90's. Without a doubt. Check it out. You will not be disappointed. Great performances by Caan, Berry, Epps, and most of the others.

    The Program may very well be the best film on college football ever done in that it shows its not quite the way it was when Pat O'Brien was playing Knute Rockne or even when Knute Rockne himself was coaching at Notre Dame. During the Nineties another classic film about professional football was done, Any Given Sunday. The main theme about Any Given Sunday was that sports was now more business than anything else. But pro football has always been a business. What The Program shows is just how much a business college football is, yet it maintains the fiction that this is amateur athletics. As is so eloquently put, no one is going to pay for a ticket to see a chemistry exam. Football with its ticket revenue, its alumni contributions, it's TV and radio rights, it's memorabilia rights is a very big business. It brings in money for the colleges, hence the colleges have a vested interest in a winning team. And some will do quite a bit more than others. James Caan does a fine job as the coach of mythical ESU who is a decent man caught up in the system. He operates his program straining the bounds of ethics. He knows full well that some of his kids are being greased right through college without an education, but football is his life and living and Caan operates the best he can. His players are a cross section of young America. Craig Sheffer is the very talented quarterback from a white trash background trying hard to rise above it. Omar Epps is the inner city ghetto kid who sees football as his ticket out. Andrew Bryniarski is the defensive player that steroids gave us, something Caan pretends not to notice until it really smacks him in the face. By the way Bryniarski was also in Any Given Sunday. My favorite in the entire film is Duane Davis who is another kid from the ghetto who both really loves the game, can barely read and write, and who also sees it as a way of rising from poverty. He's a nice kid, but a bad influence on Epps who he constantly tells that The Program will grease him through. Davis just lives for that National Football League contract. I do love the way Davis psyches himself before a scrimmage. You have to see the film to appreciate. Sad to say his is the saddest of all the stories here. You have to be made of stone to not be moved by seeing him at home, leg in a cast, listening to the final championship game with his mother, knowing the future he foresaw for himself is blasted to smithereens. Halle Berry and Kristy Swanson are there as love interests to both Epps and Sheffer respectively. There characters are quite a bit more than the usual air-headed cheerleaders cast in these parts. Another good performance is John Maynard Pennell as Sheffer's second string backup. He romances and talks Caan's daughter into taking an exam for him. When she's caught both are expelled. Caan personally kicks him out of the university and then has to swallow his pride and a good deal more to bring Pennell back when Sheffer has to go into rehab. That's also a classic scene. The Program is one of the finest, if not the finest film on college football ever done. I think more than sports fans will appreciate this finely crafted piece of cinema.

    Not really much plot - just life on a major college football team with the emphasis on their Heisman candidate QB and the freshman RB. James Caan dominates the film as the head coach who has seen it all and, after two losing seasons in a row, knows he needs a winner . Has this guy ever been in a really bad movie or given a bad performance? Goes back a long ways - he was making movies with John Wayne in the 60s. Hale Berry (before she became a star) has a big part as the tutor to the star RB. Even looks pretty for about the only time in her career. But the real appeal is Kristy Swanson, the most beautiful women in film history. She plays the QB's girl and is her usual knockout self, though she looks a few pounds overweight.

    Trips Bunch. The Power I. The Cover 2. If you know what these terms mean, and understand their uses in football strategy, then you'll really enjoy watching David S. Ward's the Program. Ward also wrote and directed Major League, a great movie; however, with The Program, it is obvious how much his sports writing style has evolved. The movie traces one season of college football for a once dominant, but now struggling Division 1 powerhouse, the fictional ESU Timeberwolves. James Caan is hilarious and well-cast as the Head Coach on the hot seat, and it's really great watching him deal with serious issues both on and off the field. Craig Shaeffer does a solid job at both his role and the QB position. His character is like a young, much more tortured Steve Young: he can throw the long ball, he can buy time with his feet, and he can do it all while battling inner demons. Omar Epps (the Wood) is simply perfectly cast as Darnell Jefferson, the prototype freshman Tailback fighting for his spot on the 1st team (plus the beautiful Halle Berry plays his love interest). The movie is filled with hilariously awesome lines and performances, and is a classic among people who actually play football. While the editing work could be scrutinized among movie Nazis (the editing job when Kane and his girl are riding his motorcycle is questionable at times), the good far outweighs the bad. Namely, the in-helmet camera work really puts you on the field with them. Overall, David S. Ward does an excellent job of jumping from perspective to perspective, and it quickly builds into this chaotic, early 90s mosaic of Division 1 college football. And surprisingly, the issues explored in the film really resonate with the issues going on in today's sports (i.e. Steroids, Motorcycle death wishes). Listen, if you haven't seen this movie, and you love football, and are of mild intelligence, then you are either really young or really lucky that you missed it because I wish i could watch it again for the first time. However, if you have no appreciation for the game of football, you're better off going elsewhere. Football idealists, be warned as well. This movie is the anti-Rudy. It's the story of one school's fight for a bowl bid, and fighting for that bid at all costs. PS- My vote is very biased. I love to quote this movie with friends. I love to watch football on both Saturday and Sunday. I play fantasy football. I play Madden. I played Division 3 football in college. You have been warned.

    This movie is a good football movie. First time i saw this movie was my freshman year in high school(it took my mind off being nervous starting at linebacker when i was a freshman) and before every home game for that matter. this movie would get me ready before every game. my tradition of watching the movie is still going on today i still watch it every time before i play in the NCAA(once again it take my mind off being a starting linebacker for Virgina Tech Baby ACC CHAMPS in 04 NATIONAL CHAMPS in 05) #5 Vick For Heisman. the HOKIES however in someways are like ESU well me and the other linebacker haven't spit in each others mouth we've had some trouble with the law, fights in locker room, steroids. it also hits on the touchy points like my roommate last his senior year my sophomore year we where going to make a tackle and he tore his ACL and MCL and it ended his season. most importantly it deals with the best part of football triumph the feeling of preforming at your best and winning the crowd going nuts!!!! there's nothing better than that well maybe winning the Heisman!

James Caan is hilarious and well-cast as the Head Coach on the hot seat, and it's really great watching him deal with serious issues both on and off the field. Craig Shaeffer does a solid job at both his role and the QB position. His character is like a young, much more tortured Steve Young: he can throw the long ball, he can buy time with his feet, and he can do it all while battling inner demons. Omar Epps (the Wood) is simply perfectly cast as Darnell Jefferson, the prototype freshman Tailback fighting for his spot on the 1st team (plus the beautiful Halle Berry plays his love interest). The movie is filled with hilariously awesome lines and performances, and is a classic among people who actually play football. While the editing work could be scrutinized among movie Nazis (the editing job when Kane and his girl are riding his motorcycle is questionable at times), the good far outweighs the bad. Namely, the in-helmet camera work really puts you on the field with them. Overall, David S. Ward does an excellent job of jumping from perspective to perspective, and it quickly builds into this chaotic, early 90s mosaic of Division 1 college football. And surprisingly, the issues explored in the film really resonate with the issues going on in today's sports (i.e. Steroids, Motorcycle death wishes). Listen, if you haven't seen this movie, and you love football, and are of mild intelligence, then you are either really young or really lucky that you missed it because I wish i could watch it again for the first time. However, if you have no appreciation for the game of football, you're better off going elsewhere. Football idealists, be warned as well. This movie is the anti-Rudy. It's the story of one school's fight for a bowl bid, and fighting for that bid at all costs. PS- My vote is very biased. I love to quote this movie with friends. I love to watch football on both Saturday and Sunday. I play fantasy football. I play Madden. I played Division 3 football in college. You have been warned.

    This movie is a good football movie. First time i saw this movie was my freshman year in high school(it took my mind off being nervous starting at linebacker when i was a freshman) and before every home game for that matter. this movie would get me ready before every game. my tradition of watching the movie is still going on today i still watch it every time before i play in the NCAA(once again it take my mind off being a starting linebacker for Virgina Tech Baby ACC CHAMPS in 04 NATIONAL CHAMPS in 05) #5 Vick For Heisman. the HOKIES however in someways are like ESU well me and the other linebacker haven't spit in each others mouth we've had some trouble with the law, fights in locker room, steroids. it also hits on the touchy points like my roommate last his senior year my sophomore year we where going to make a tackle and he tore his ACL and MCL and it ended his season. most importantly it deals with the best part of football triumph the feeling of preforming at your best and winning the crowd going nuts!!!! there's nothing better than that well maybe winning the Heisman!

    This movie was nothing short of shocking when it came out in 1993. The average person had a hard time believing the things depicted were based on actual accounts in colleges across the country. It wasn't until 20/20 reminded people of various scandals in college football (the 77-87 SMU mustangs are the perfect example of this movie) that the American public saw just how far players and schools will go to win. I still look at this movie with some sadness. You see how a player is treated with kid gloves when they are All-Americans, and when they are injured permanently and are of no use to the team, they are chewed up and spit out and quickly forgotten. Some ask for it, while others fall victims to their universities demands to push it to the limit and beyond! All in all, this is a very entertaining movie.

    You do not have to be a great fan of college football to appreciate this film but I suspect watching it might offer you a change to become a fan. Visually, the movie is quite lovely. It has a lush warm tone that is unaffected but effective. I like this film. I like the story. I like the way the film is executed. I find the story and characters credible and interesting. The contrast of themes or counterpoint of themes works well. The then young actors seem realistic. They are multidimensional. In fact, this is one of the best football movies. Dialogue is playful intelligent, and perceptive. The film uses multiple points-of-view and varies them in interesting ways. There are subjective reaction shots and asides that give the narrative great interest. I love the helmet camera images.

    OK ladies this movie, is about football. No its about the Program, yeah the program. I was scratching my head recently trying to remember this movie which i thought may have had Cuba Gooding JR in it about football. These two scenes kept playing out in my head, one was of a bunch of guys on the yellow line in the middle of a two lane street lying down head to foot while cars rushed by. The other was of this guy head-butting car windows. Well thats all i had to go on and after much scouring i found the movie the same place i always do. In a thrift store for a dollar! So i run home and toss it in waiting to see this part with the team on the ground in the street, and its not there. Apparently life imitates art and people who saw the original screening took to the streets and lay down in traffic. Some people died and plenty were hurt in a scarring prospect that left filmmakers to delete, and destroy the negative. I actually thought the movie was pretty good sides that and the head-butting scene is totally in tact. I wonder how many people head-butted cars after this? Or did steroids, this movie has an odd charm. I only played pop warner so i don't know if this is an accurate portrayal of college football, but really does it matter? were not exactly talking about portraying Jesus Christ here, its football and despite the name feet are mostly used just for running. Bunch of up and comers and well established actors and actresses in this one. Done well, it was worth the dollar, but in all honesty it was good. Seven thumbs.

    This is the best football movie ever made. It doesn't have all the clich&eacute;s that normal football movies have where the starting quarterback gets the beautiful cheerleader and any certain game is won at the buzzer on some totally bizarre play. It's about the truth of what goes on in the college game. Sure, this stuff doesn't happen everywhere, but it certain frickin' happens. I'm talking about the steroids, the football players being allowed a free pass when it comes to academics, the fact that some people cannot even read but are able to go to college just to play a damn game. This movie shows it all. James Caan does a perfect job of playing the coach trying to keep it all together. Although he is corrupted just as much as his players, he had his own problems to worry about with losing his job so he had a big balancing act to perform. This movie was NOT about triumph, it's about tragedy and sacrifice that young men make just to be a top player in a sport which in the long run normally doesn't amount to anything. Great watch for you people who don't know much about the "behind the scenes" stuff and if you haven't seen this movie and are interested in college football, check it out. It's not necessarily a greatly acted movie, but it's a very telling movie which more people should pay attention to. 7 out of 10 in my book for what it's worth.

    Great college football film. The cast clicked and the direction was outstanding. This film takes you behind the scenes as to what goes on in College Football. The politics, the drugs, the drinking, the pressure involved, and just the work ethic and what it takes to be a good Football team. Great value as far as the locations, the football games seemed so real, with the crowds, very convincing movie. I loved it all the way around. If people dislike this movie, it is probably due to wishing their doing better things with their lives. I agree with a comment, this is one of the best football films of the 90's. Without a doubt. Check it out. You will not be disappointed. Great performances by Caan, Berry, Epps, and most of the others.

    The Program may very well be the best film on college football ever done in that it shows its not quite the way it was when Pat O'Brien was playing Knute Rockne or even when Knute Rockne himself was coaching at Notre Dame. During the Nineties another classic film about professional football was done, Any Given Sunday. The main theme about Any Given Sunday was that sports was now more business than anything else. But pro football has always been a business. What The Program shows is just how much a business college football is, yet it maintains the fiction that this is amateur athletics. As is so eloquently put, no one is going to pay for a ticket to see a chemistry exam. Football with its ticket revenue, its alumni contributions, it's TV and radio rights, it's memorabilia rights is a very big business. It brings in money for the colleges, hence the colleges have a vested interest in a winning team. And some will do quite a bit more than others. James Caan does a fine job as the coach of mythical ESU who is a decent man caught up in the system. He operates his program straining the bounds of ethics. He knows full well that some of his kids are being greased right through college without an education, but football is his life and living and Caan operates the best he can. His players are a cross section of young America. Craig Sheffer is the very talented quarterback from a white trash background trying hard to rise above it. Omar Epps is the inner city ghetto kid who sees football as his ticket out. Andrew Bryniarski is the defensive player that steroids gave us, something Caan pretends not to notice until it really smacks him in the face. By the way Bryniarski was also in Any Given Sunday. My favorite in the entire film is Duane Davis who is another kid from the ghetto who both really loves the game, can barely read and write, and who also sees it as a way of rising from poverty. He's a nice kid, but a bad influence on Epps who he constantly tells that The Program will grease him through. Davis just lives for that National Football League contract. I do love the way Davis psyches himself before a scrimmage. You have to see the film to appreciate. Sad to say his is the saddest of all the stories here. You have to be made of stone to not be moved by seeing him at home, leg in a cast, listening to the final championship game with his mother, knowing the future he foresaw for himself is blasted to smithereens. Halle Berry and Kristy Swanson are there as love interests to both Epps and Sheffer respectively. There characters are quite a bit more than the usual air-headed cheerleaders cast in these parts. Another good performance is John Maynard Pennell as Sheffer's second string backup. He romances and talks Caan's daughter into taking an exam for him. When she's caught both are expelled. Caan personally kicks him out of the university and then has to swallow his pride and a good deal more to bring Pennell back when Sheffer has to go into rehab. That's also a classic scene. The Program is one of the finest, if not the finest film on college football ever done. I think more than sports fans will appreciate this finely crafted piece of cinema.

    Not really much plot - just life on a major college football team with the emphasis on their Heisman candidate QB and the freshman RB. James Caan dominates the film as the head coach who has seen it all and, after two losing seasons in a row, knows he needs a winner . Has this guy ever been in a really bad movie or given a bad performance? Goes back a long ways - he was making movies with John Wayne in the 60s. Hale Berry (before she became a star) has a big part as the tutor to the star RB. Even looks pretty for about the only time in her career. But the real appeal is Kristy Swanson, the most beautiful women in film history. She plays the QB's girl and is her usual knockout self, though she looks a few pounds overweight.

    Trips Bunch. The Power I. The Cover 2. If you know what these terms mean, and understand their uses in football strategy, then you'll really enjoy watching David S. Ward's the Program. Ward also wrote and directed Major League, a great movie; however, with The Program, it is obvious how much his sports writing style has evolved. The movie traces one season of college football for a once dominant, but now struggling Division 1 powerhouse, the fictional ESU Timeberwolves. James Caan is hilarious and well-cast as the Head Coach on the hot seat, and it's really great watching him deal with serious issues both on and off the field.

    Trips Bunch. The Power I. The Cover 2. If you know what these terms mean, and understand their uses in football strategy, then you'll really enjoy watching David S. Ward's the Program. Ward also wrote and directed Major League, a great movie; however, with The Program, it is obvious how much his sports writing style has evolved. The movie traces one season of college football for a once dominant, but now struggling Division 1 powerhouse, the fictional ESU Timeberwolves. James Caan is hilarious and well-cast as the Head Coach on the hot seat, and it's really great watching him deal with serious issues both on and off the field. Craig Shaeffer does a solid job at both his role and the QB position. His character is like a young, much more tortured Steve Young: he can throw the long ball, he can buy time with his feet, and he can do it all while battling inner demons. Omar Epps (the Wood) is simply perfectly cast as Darnell Jefferson, the prototype freshman Tailback fighting for his spot on the 1st team (plus the beautiful Halle Berry plays his love interest). The movie is filled with hilariously awesome lines and performances, and is a classic among people who actually play football. While the editing work could be scrutinized among movie Nazis (the editing job when Kane and his girl are riding his motorcycle is questionable at times), the good far outweighs the bad. Namely, the in-helmet camera work really puts you on the field with them. Overall, David S. Ward does an excellent job of jumping from perspective to perspective, and it quickly builds into this chaotic, early 90s mosaic of Division 1 college football. And surprisingly, the issues explored in the film really resonate with the issues going on in today's sports (i.e. Steroids, Motorcycle death wishes). Listen, if you haven't seen this movie, and you love football, and are of mild intelligence, then you are either really young or really lucky that you missed it because I wish i could watch it again for the first time. However, if you have no appreciation for the game of football, you're better off going elsewhere. Football idealists, be warned as well. This movie is the anti-Rudy. It's the story of one school's fight for a bowl bid, and fighting for that bid at all costs. PS- My vote is very biased. I love to quote this movie with friends. I love to watch football on both Saturday and Sunday. I play fantasy football. I play Madden. I played Division 3 football in college. You have been warned.

    This movie is a good football movie. First time i saw this movie was my freshman year in high school(it took my mind off being nervous starting at linebacker when i was a freshman) and before every home game for that matter. this movie would get me ready before every game. my tradition of watching the movie is still going on today i still watch it every time before i play in the NCAA(once again it take my mind off being a starting linebacker for Virgina Tech Baby ACC CHAMPS in 04 NATIONAL CHAMPS in 05) #5 Vick For Heisman. the HOKIES however in someways are like ESU well me and the other linebacker haven't spit in each others mouth we've had some trouble with the law, fights in locker room, steroids. it also hits on the touchy points like my roommate last his senior year my sophomore year we where going to make a tackle and he tore his ACL and MCL and it ended his season. most importantly it deals with the best part of football triumph the feeling of preforming at your best and winning the crowd going nuts!!!! there's nothing better than that well maybe winning the Heisman!
