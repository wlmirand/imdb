    I finally got around to seeing GI Jane. Quite a good movie - the brutality of the training bits really puts into context what women might face in combat and the "real", not theoretical brutality they face. Unfortunately, an otherwise excellent movie loses out due to a tacked-on and militarily nonsensical battle scene which occupies the last 25 minutes. The movie should have ended after Demi gave the Senator an ultimatum and she is seen, in the distance, rejoining her unit in training. By that point, all of the major hurdles and challenges will have been overcome, and we would know that the future would be there as she was to make it. It would have been a fitting ending. The dumb battle scene in the end was just awful on many levels.

    "I am wrong." Henry said. Henry and Kristl were sitting in their garage turned Cinema. The garage was a workshop with large windows and three sliding doors that was part of a petrol station. Henry and Kristl could rent it for an agreeable price, because the ground was polluted by oil and other fluids associated with cars that had spilled for decades onto the floor and fouled the soil underneath. "We could make it into a public restroom." Henry had said. "We were going to make it into a private cinema?" Kristl answered. "We could make some money on the side to cover our expenses." Henry said. "And who is going to clean this restroom?" Kristl's gaze made Henry think of a snake about to strike. "We could make it automatic, perhaps. "Henry sweat-ed a bit and felt like he had just discovered he was walking in a minefield. "A Henry o'matic." Kristl said with a flat voice.. "Uhmm." "Just wrong. Plain wrong. " Henry continued, "That is why I never get any girl friends." "But I am your friend?" Kristl said. "Yes, but I don't mean a friend friend, but a girl friend friend." "Ah." "A man like me would do something like this." Henry produced out of nowhere a small white dish on which was placed a chocolate &eacute;clair with dark chocolate of such fine color that it made Kristl's mouth water. Next to it was a fine silver spoon, that shone green in the light of the exit sign. Kristl was staring transfixed at the chocolate &eacute;clair. "You see.. I would have the notion that you give this to someone you like and that she, the she being you in this case, would like me for it. Just to be nice." "Who do you want to have killed for that?" Kristl smiled. "I don't want anything for it, you just get it for free because you are my friend. Not a girl friend kinda friend, but a friend friend." "Gracias." Kristl took hold of the dish with a slightly trembling hand. "But I am silly really, because women want to be tough cookies that like to be trounced so you get respect from them and you get trounced by them so they respect you.. And then the greatest praise you can get from them is: 'suck my dick'" Kristl was eyeing her &eacute;clair in a way that clearly showed she had not yet made up her mind to swallow it whole or eat it in small bits. She decided on the latter. "I am overjoyed that US finest troops are in reality dumb gung ho halfwits that are trained to a sharp killer edge by humiliation and torture. Guess that makes a good soldier." "suck my dick?" Henry said, "What does that mean?" "Well, she wants to be man really, so that guy can suck hers or his. I am getting a bit confused." "I was a bit embarrassed when that one guy walks up to her and stammers 'yu are okaj' to her like he was lurch from the Addams Family. I thought well, Seals, aren't they the finest of our men? Somehow Lurch doesn't quite fit in with that picture." "It actually makes me happy. Would be scary to think they were serious experienced intelligent men with a professional attitude. They could be effective and deadly..brr. " Kristl said and continued, "I was a bit annoyed when it was suggested it was bad that she might be a lesbian. Oh my god she is a lesbian! We have to put up with blacks, women, gays and now with lesbian So what does that say: you can be a woman in the army but not when you are a lesbian?" "Imagine being a black lesbian" Henry laughed. "But how do you feel about the whole movie?" "I have to say it was an exceptionally run-of-the-mill movie. I didn't like any of the people in it. They were an amalgam of faces in dark surroundings. Then the movie used all the clich&eacute;s. The politicians who can't be trusted and sell you out if it suits their fancy. The lone hero Jane who, having no experience whatsoever in politics, manipulates that woman, with decades of experience in politics. The cigar crunching commander with the I-don't-like-politics attitude. The drill sergeant who is tough on her but finally grudgingly starts to respect her. The boys who first look down on her and then become her buddies." "Yes, but I think that was all you could do with the story." Henry nodded. "G. I. Jane has proved that us women can be beaten and humiliated as any other man in the army. And isn't this sad? How great is it that such fine intelligent people are wasting their lives on something so utterly needless as the act of waging war? There are people who can contribute something of value to the progress of humanity, but the only thing they learn is 'how to blow things up'. The movie is a hallmark of utter waste: now we women can be as useless as any men because we have equal access to all the branches of the army." "Hurrah for equality." Henry said. "Any more of those &eacute;clairs?" Kristl smiled. "A whole box of them." Henry winked as he showed her the box, "Come and get them." After chasing Henry for five minutes He gave in and handed her the box. "All for equality." Henry said. "Jummy." Said Kristl.

    This one was bound to raise many Red Flags in a lot of Quarters. It is a Movie with a target on its back daring you to shoot. Taking a "Women in Combat" controversy, although it seems less so Today", and shoving it in your Face like a Drill Sergeant daring you to speak out. This Movie is a Noble effort, but it may have aimed a bit too high. The concept here, (just give us an equal chance to be equal) would have been more realistic if Ridley Scott and Writer David Twohy had not chosen the prestigious Navy Seals with its famous dropout rate, and the Elite of the Elite status, as a Battleground for Politics. That takes it to a level of arguable absurdity. It would have been more believable and may have quieted the Nay-Sayers somewhat, if it was simply the U.S. Marines or any other simply difficult and grueling group of the Military's Might. But given that Melodramatic Fiction (see below), this can be inspirational and Entertaining in a Hollywood Underdog Story that it does so well. It is one of Demi Moore's best efforts. THIS IS FROM NAVY.COM......by law there are two communities that women are not allowed to join: the Navy SEAL and Navy SWCC communities.

    This movie is proof that in Hollywood all things are possible. I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays "Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill" who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it "Senator Lillian DeHaven" also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all "gender norms" as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor "Master Chief John James Urgayle" (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one.

    G.I.Jane has some obvious flaws. Not the least of which is when Demi Moore walks into the mess with obviously no bra on under her white tee shirt. No self respecting female trying to get into the world of a macho, hyper-testosterone fueled job would do anything to accentuate her femininity. No makeup,no feminine underwear,nothing that makes her different than a male recruit. A fact shown to good example when Moore shaves all her hair off during a break and I give her credit for actually doing it and not faking it by wearing a wig. That takes guts. As someone who has been through something similar,I can tell you that not being wanted in a group of men elicits a type of behavior in a group mentality that would never happen if the man was alone. I really enjoyed this film despite some of its problems at suspending disbelief. For example, when the master chief is looking at the exercise where the recruits are in the rain, climbing forward on their bellies under barbed wire, he's "seeing" the action that wouldn't be possible through a scope or binoculars. Another is when each team in is the water and picked up "on the go" as the inflatable rafts rush by. Each male is given help by someone inside the raft and hoisted up inside. Yet when Moore's character turn comes, there is no help and she slips back into the water. She's unable to do it but is later criticized by the Master Chief for not being able to lift her "own body weight." Well, we don't know if that's so or not, as all the males were helped getting inside. There are other instances of such examples but the thing that makes this film work for me is I know how it feels to be unwanted and be considered incapable of doing what's considered typically a "man's job." The politics and technical mistakes aside, the real essence of the film is if a woman wants to fight for her country she should be able to.

    The Whole Concept Addressed: This movie must have been put out by some feminist organization trying to promote women in the military into more combat positions. Personally, I don't mind women in the military, but I am against women directly in combat. It's nasty business and no woman should be slinging a gun, going toe and fist; knife in hand on a combat field only to get captured, raped, and tortured by the enemy. What woman in her right mind would want to do this anyway? As for the plot; it was so glamorized by Hollywood & unrealistic, I laughed. Real SEAL CRT Training has little resemblance to the way it is portrayed in this movie. However, the movie keeps you entertained, esp with HOTTIE, Demi Moore. I would say it is worth seeing. A Better alternative to this movie: Act of Valor is about real Navy SEALS in action. Now that is a good movie!

    "G.I. Jane" is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS, the most elite and toughest training. Now, O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and co-written by the creator of the "Chronicles of Riddick" series, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like "Pitch Black" that much, so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it. Demi Moore plays Lieutenant O'Neill, a tough, no-nonsense girl who just wants to get in on the action. Out of all the roles I've seen Demi Moore in, this is my favourite one yet. She's strong-willed, determined, and as the film goes on, she becomes a giant badass. If there was ever a woman's version of "The Expendables", Demi Moore would definitely be in it. She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head, forms abs and gets totally ripped, she is still incredibly hot. Viggo Mortensen plays John, the Master Chief. No, not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen, you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal, mean, and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all, but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword. The atmosphere in this movie is awesome. You're watching all these guys and O'Neill go through boot camp and you're just sitting there going "Yeah, I couldn't do that. That's just gross". Like there's one part where they have five minutes to eat dinner and do they get fresh food? No. They get the scraps from their lunch. So their eating like half eaten corn and weird goop that been sitting there for half a day. I have to be honest, I wouldn't survive 1 day at that place. The last 20 minutes are my least favourite part of the film. It's kind of like "Full Metal Jacket" in the way that once they leave bootcamp, the movie goes downhill. But unlike "Full Metal Jacket", the movie only goes downhill a bit. It was kind of just an excuse to make stuff blow up and have a gunfight but I'm not complaining. Got to say, Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool. Overall, I highly enjoyed "G.I. Jane". I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass, and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on Blu-Ray.

    The first thing that I heard about this movie was that the US Navy was opposed to making it and was very resistant to allowing Scott to use any of their facilities. I don't know what happened in the end but they seemed to be using some pretty hi-tech weaponry. One just doesn't walk down to a corner store and buy an Apache, though I thought the Apache was being used very ineffectively in the situation. Basically the Navy Seals were being pursued by a Lybian border patrol and they were on foot, so the Apache was firing missiles. I would have used the chain gun because it is much more effective against infantry than missiles, missiles are for tanks and other vehicles. G.I. Jane is a protest movie and it is about women in the military in front line jobs. The Navy Seals are said to be the best of the front line troops and thus we focus on this. The movie is much more political and deals a lot with the political ramifications of what is going on. The biggest protest here is that nobody wants to bring women home in body bags. What the women say is that they can do anything that a man can do, so if a man can be a front line soldier, then a woman should be as well. Starship Troopers actually has women as front line soldiers. We see the main character wanting to be treated like all the other men, but at first she is given help because they feel that she needs it. What she doesn't want is to be treated any differently. The is opposition to what she is doing but it doesn't come out as strong as it did in the previews. In the previews we are led to believe that everywhere she goes she faces opposition, but this is not true. People do try to persuade her from doing it, but she is stubborn and continues. It is the political side of the movie that draws the criticism. The politicians say that they don't want women coming home in body bags. The whole idea is about change and people don't want to do it. Feminisim is a very strong force in today's society and now we are moving further into what originally were male only jobs. Today we see women weightlifters and labourers, but we still don't see women soldiers. In Australia we have women on the naval ships but not in infantry. Now, in this movie, we see the beginnings of a protest against this. The movie itself was a little confusing at times because the characters seem to mumble and it was hard to concentrate with Louisa and Melissa doing their usual girly things behind me, but that was not Ridley Scott's fault. His dark, wet style is very evident here, though it is quite different to Burton's style. Scott focuses more on this protest, and his darkness is much more realistic. Scott seems to keep the movie dark as a symbol of this world where women are not free to do what they like. Scott also seems to like rain because it is raining a lot in this movie. This seems to symbolise the struggle that the soldiers are going through in the training. The training is very hard, and Scott reminds us of this constantly. They eat from bins and go through training to handle torture and capture. They are beaten up, drowned, and pushed to the limit. They say that there is a 60% dropout rate, and most of them want Jane to do it, but she doesn't. She makes it through a large part of the course only to become a political embarrassment.

    Lovely for the game between dreams of childhood and the facts of old age. Poetry in skin of nostalgic nuances. Comedy and emotional travel, adventures with Jules Verne taste and bridges between visions of a female buck private and an old man.The empty heard of dream and forms of escape. Mixture of feelings, colors and ingenuity. And delicate form to tell a special story, no different of many others but full of lights of life sense.A movie for lost ages. Or guide for teenagers. Picture of cocoon steps and discover of basic parts of happiness. Map of way of life and scene of intre ballistic missiles fly. A snail and its wings. And the beauty of truth behind any appearance. The rest - silence. Joy of an experience .

    This movie is a story that shows the grimy an and gritty parts in war with Demi Moore who is a skilled worker in politics and is trying to help a charismatic and charming soldier. This movie is about what happens in the background when it comes to war. The movie has topnotch actors and they all do a fantastic job but what really makes this movie shine is the dialogue. It's just well written and sharp. A movie by Scott can be a hit or a miss and this one is a hit. It's well directed, well written and acting is topnotch. And watching the progress and direction of the protagonist's ideology is engrossing while he is helping run a campaign. Anyways the dialogue made the movie intriguing and entertaining to just watch and listen to people talk in this. There is other movies that has a similar premise as this with the campaign for presidency and everything but this one really does show the dirty side of politics. Although some parts may seem a bit far-fetched than others. I liked the character development in this and how, you don't know unless your hit a wall or put yourself in others shoes. I would personally watch this movie again later on in the future.

But given that Melodramatic Fiction (see below), this can be inspirational and Entertaining in a Hollywood Underdog Story that it does so well. It is one of Demi Moore's best efforts. THIS IS FROM NAVY.COM......by law there are two communities that women are not allowed to join: the Navy SEAL and Navy SWCC communities.

    This movie is proof that in Hollywood all things are possible. I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays "Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill" who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it "Senator Lillian DeHaven" also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all "gender norms" as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor "Master Chief John James Urgayle" (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one.

    G.I.Jane has some obvious flaws. Not the least of which is when Demi Moore walks into the mess with obviously no bra on under her white tee shirt. No self respecting female trying to get into the world of a macho, hyper-testosterone fueled job would do anything to accentuate her femininity. No makeup,no feminine underwear,nothing that makes her different than a male recruit. A fact shown to good example when Moore shaves all her hair off during a break and I give her credit for actually doing it and not faking it by wearing a wig. That takes guts. As someone who has been through something similar,I can tell you that not being wanted in a group of men elicits a type of behavior in a group mentality that would never happen if the man was alone. I really enjoyed this film despite some of its problems at suspending disbelief. For example, when the master chief is looking at the exercise where the recruits are in the rain, climbing forward on their bellies under barbed wire, he's "seeing" the action that wouldn't be possible through a scope or binoculars. Another is when each team in is the water and picked up "on the go" as the inflatable rafts rush by. Each male is given help by someone inside the raft and hoisted up inside. Yet when Moore's character turn comes, there is no help and she slips back into the water. She's unable to do it but is later criticized by the Master Chief for not being able to lift her "own body weight." Well, we don't know if that's so or not, as all the males were helped getting inside. There are other instances of such examples but the thing that makes this film work for me is I know how it feels to be unwanted and be considered incapable of doing what's considered typically a "man's job." The politics and technical mistakes aside, the real essence of the film is if a woman wants to fight for her country she should be able to.

    The Whole Concept Addressed: This movie must have been put out by some feminist organization trying to promote women in the military into more combat positions. Personally, I don't mind women in the military, but I am against women directly in combat. It's nasty business and no woman should be slinging a gun, going toe and fist; knife in hand on a combat field only to get captured, raped, and tortured by the enemy. What woman in her right mind would want to do this anyway? As for the plot; it was so glamorized by Hollywood & unrealistic, I laughed. Real SEAL CRT Training has little resemblance to the way it is portrayed in this movie. However, the movie keeps you entertained, esp with HOTTIE, Demi Moore. I would say it is worth seeing. A Better alternative to this movie: Act of Valor is about real Navy SEALS in action. Now that is a good movie!

    "G.I. Jane" is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS, the most elite and toughest training. Now, O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and co-written by the creator of the "Chronicles of Riddick" series, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like "Pitch Black" that much, so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it. Demi Moore plays Lieutenant O'Neill, a tough, no-nonsense girl who just wants to get in on the action. Out of all the roles I've seen Demi Moore in, this is my favourite one yet. She's strong-willed, determined, and as the film goes on, she becomes a giant badass. If there was ever a woman's version of "The Expendables", Demi Moore would definitely be in it. She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head, forms abs and gets totally ripped, she is still incredibly hot. Viggo Mortensen plays John, the Master Chief. No, not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen, you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal, mean, and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all, but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword. The atmosphere in this movie is awesome. You're watching all these guys and O'Neill go through boot camp and you're just sitting there going "Yeah, I couldn't do that. That's just gross". Like there's one part where they have five minutes to eat dinner and do they get fresh food? No. They get the scraps from their lunch. So their eating like half eaten corn and weird goop that been sitting there for half a day. I have to be honest, I wouldn't survive 1 day at that place. The last 20 minutes are my least favourite part of the film. It's kind of like "Full Metal Jacket" in the way that once they leave bootcamp, the movie goes downhill. But unlike "Full Metal Jacket", the movie only goes downhill a bit. It was kind of just an excuse to make stuff blow up and have a gunfight but I'm not complaining. Got to say, Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool. Overall, I highly enjoyed "G.I. Jane". I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass, and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on Blu-Ray.

    The first thing that I heard about this movie was that the US Navy was opposed to making it and was very resistant to allowing Scott to use any of their facilities. I don't know what happened in the end but they seemed to be using some pretty hi-tech weaponry. One just doesn't walk down to a corner store and buy an Apache, though I thought the Apache was being used very ineffectively in the situation. Basically the Navy Seals were being pursued by a Lybian border patrol and they were on foot, so the Apache was firing missiles. I would have used the chain gun because it is much more effective against infantry than missiles, missiles are for tanks and other vehicles. G.I. Jane is a protest movie and it is about women in the military in front line jobs. The Navy Seals are said to be the best of the front line troops and thus we focus on this. The movie is much more political and deals a lot with the political ramifications of what is going on. The biggest protest here is that nobody wants to bring women home in body bags. What the women say is that they can do anything that a man can do, so if a man can be a front line soldier, then a woman should be as well. Starship Troopers actually has women as front line soldiers. We see the main character wanting to be treated like all the other men, but at first she is given help because they feel that she needs it. What she doesn't want is to be treated any differently. The is opposition to what she is doing but it doesn't come out as strong as it did in the previews. In the previews we are led to believe that everywhere she goes she faces opposition, but this is not true. People do try to persuade her from doing it, but she is stubborn and continues. It is the political side of the movie that draws the criticism. The politicians say that they don't want women coming home in body bags. The whole idea is about change and people don't want to do it. Feminisim is a very strong force in today's society and now we are moving further into what originally were male only jobs. Today we see women weightlifters and labourers, but we still don't see women soldiers. In Australia we have women on the naval ships but not in infantry. Now, in this movie, we see the beginnings of a protest against this. The movie itself was a little confusing at times because the characters seem to mumble and it was hard to concentrate with Louisa and Melissa doing their usual girly things behind me, but that was not Ridley Scott's fault. His dark, wet style is very evident here, though it is quite different to Burton's style. Scott focuses more on this protest, and his darkness is much more realistic. Scott seems to keep the movie dark as a symbol of this world where women are not free to do what they like. Scott also seems to like rain because it is raining a lot in this movie. This seems to symbolise the struggle that the soldiers are going through in the training. The training is very hard, and Scott reminds us of this constantly. They eat from bins and go through training to handle torture and capture. They are beaten up, drowned, and pushed to the limit. They say that there is a 60% dropout rate, and most of them want Jane to do it, but she doesn't. She makes it through a large part of the course only to become a political embarrassment.

    Lovely for the game between dreams of childhood and the facts of old age. Poetry in skin of nostalgic nuances. Comedy and emotional travel, adventures with Jules Verne taste and bridges between visions of a female buck private and an old man.The empty heard of dream and forms of escape. Mixture of feelings, colors and ingenuity. And delicate form to tell a special story, no different of many others but full of lights of life sense.A movie for lost ages. Or guide for teenagers. Picture of cocoon steps and discover of basic parts of happiness. Map of way of life and scene of intre ballistic missiles fly. A snail and its wings. And the beauty of truth behind any appearance. The rest - silence. Joy of an experience .

    This movie is a story that shows the grimy an and gritty parts in war with Demi Moore who is a skilled worker in politics and is trying to help a charismatic and charming soldier. This movie is about what happens in the background when it comes to war. The movie has topnotch actors and they all do a fantastic job but what really makes this movie shine is the dialogue. It's just well written and sharp. A movie by Scott can be a hit or a miss and this one is a hit. It's well directed, well written and acting is topnotch. And watching the progress and direction of the protagonist's ideology is engrossing while he is helping run a campaign. Anyways the dialogue made the movie intriguing and entertaining to just watch and listen to people talk in this. There is other movies that has a similar premise as this with the campaign for presidency and everything but this one really does show the dirty side of politics. Although some parts may seem a bit far-fetched than others. I liked the character development in this and how, you don't know unless your hit a wall or put yourself in others shoes. I would personally watch this movie again later on in the future.

    I finally got around to seeing GI Jane. Quite a good movie - the brutality of the training bits really puts into context what women might face in combat and the "real", not theoretical brutality they face. Unfortunately, an otherwise excellent movie loses out due to a tacked-on and militarily nonsensical battle scene which occupies the last 25 minutes. The movie should have ended after Demi gave the Senator an ultimatum and she is seen, in the distance, rejoining her unit in training. By that point, all of the major hurdles and challenges will have been overcome, and we would know that the future would be there as she was to make it. It would have been a fitting ending. The dumb battle scene in the end was just awful on many levels.

    "I am wrong." Henry said. Henry and Kristl were sitting in their garage turned Cinema. The garage was a workshop with large windows and three sliding doors that was part of a petrol station. Henry and Kristl could rent it for an agreeable price, because the ground was polluted by oil and other fluids associated with cars that had spilled for decades onto the floor and fouled the soil underneath. "We could make it into a public restroom." Henry had said. "We were going to make it into a private cinema?" Kristl answered. "We could make some money on the side to cover our expenses." Henry said. "And who is going to clean this restroom?" Kristl's gaze made Henry think of a snake about to strike. "We could make it automatic, perhaps. "Henry sweat-ed a bit and felt like he had just discovered he was walking in a minefield. "A Henry o'matic." Kristl said with a flat voice.. "Uhmm." "Just wrong. Plain wrong. " Henry continued, "That is why I never get any girl friends." "But I am your friend?" Kristl said. "Yes, but I don't mean a friend friend, but a girl friend friend." "Ah." "A man like me would do something like this." Henry produced out of nowhere a small white dish on which was placed a chocolate &eacute;clair with dark chocolate of such fine color that it made Kristl's mouth water. Next to it was a fine silver spoon, that shone green in the light of the exit sign. Kristl was staring transfixed at the chocolate &eacute;clair. "You see.. I would have the notion that you give this to someone you like and that she, the she being you in this case, would like me for it. Just to be nice." "Who do you want to have killed for that?" Kristl smiled. "I don't want anything for it, you just get it for free because you are my friend. Not a girl friend kinda friend, but a friend friend." "Gracias." Kristl took hold of the dish with a slightly trembling hand. "But I am silly really, because women want to be tough cookies that like to be trounced so you get respect from them and you get trounced by them so they respect you.. And then the greatest praise you can get from them is: 'suck my dick'" Kristl was eyeing her &eacute;clair in a way that clearly showed she had not yet made up her mind to swallow it whole or eat it in small bits. She decided on the latter. "I am overjoyed that US finest troops are in reality dumb gung ho halfwits that are trained to a sharp killer edge by humiliation and torture. Guess that makes a good soldier." "suck my dick?" Henry said, "What does that mean?" "Well, she wants to be man really, so that guy can suck hers or his. I am getting a bit confused." "I was a bit embarrassed when that one guy walks up to her and stammers 'yu are okaj' to her like he was lurch from the Addams Family. I thought well, Seals, aren't they the finest of our men? Somehow Lurch doesn't quite fit in with that picture." "It actually makes me happy. Would be scary to think they were serious experienced intelligent men with a professional attitude. They could be effective and deadly..brr. " Kristl said and continued, "I was a bit annoyed when it was suggested it was bad that she might be a lesbian. Oh my god she is a lesbian! We have to put up with blacks, women, gays and now with lesbian So what does that say: you can be a woman in the army but not when you are a lesbian?" "Imagine being a black lesbian" Henry laughed. "But how do you feel about the whole movie?" "I have to say it was an exceptionally run-of-the-mill movie. I didn't like any of the people in it. They were an amalgam of faces in dark surroundings. Then the movie used all the clich&eacute;s. The politicians who can't be trusted and sell you out if it suits their fancy. The lone hero Jane who, having no experience whatsoever in politics, manipulates that woman, with decades of experience in politics. The cigar crunching commander with the I-don't-like-politics attitude. The drill sergeant who is tough on her but finally grudgingly starts to respect her. The boys who first look down on her and then become her buddies." "Yes, but I think that was all you could do with the story." Henry nodded. "G. I. Jane has proved that us women can be beaten and humiliated as any other man in the army. And isn't this sad? How great is it that such fine intelligent people are wasting their lives on something so utterly needless as the act of waging war? There are people who can contribute something of value to the progress of humanity, but the only thing they learn is 'how to blow things up'. The movie is a hallmark of utter waste: now we women can be as useless as any men because we have equal access to all the branches of the army." "Hurrah for equality." Henry said. "Any more of those &eacute;clairs?" Kristl smiled. "A whole box of them." Henry winked as he showed her the box, "Come and get them." After chasing Henry for five minutes He gave in and handed her the box. "All for equality." Henry said. "Jummy." Said Kristl.

    This one was bound to raise many Red Flags in a lot of Quarters. It is a Movie with a target on its back daring you to shoot. Taking a "Women in Combat" controversy, although it seems less so Today", and shoving it in your Face like a Drill Sergeant daring you to speak out. This Movie is a Noble effort, but it may have aimed a bit too high. The concept here, (just give us an equal chance to be equal) would have been more realistic if Ridley Scott and Writer David Twohy had not chosen the prestigious Navy Seals with its famous dropout rate, and the Elite of the Elite status, as a Battleground for Politics. That takes it to a level of arguable absurdity. It would have been more believable and may have quieted the Nay-Sayers somewhat, if it was simply the U.S. Marines or any other simply difficult and grueling group of the Military's Might. But given that Melodramatic Fiction (see below), this can be inspirational and Entertaining in a Hollywood Underdog Story that it does so well. It is one of Demi Moore's best efforts. THIS IS FROM NAVY.COM......by law there are two communities that women are not allowed to join: the Navy SEAL and Navy SWCC communities.

One just doesn't walk down to a corner store and buy an Apache, though I thought the Apache was being used very ineffectively in the situation. Basically the Navy Seals were being pursued by a Lybian border patrol and they were on foot, so the Apache was firing missiles. I would have used the chain gun because it is much more effective against infantry than missiles, missiles are for tanks and other vehicles. G.I. Jane is a protest movie and it is about women in the military in front line jobs. The Navy Seals are said to be the best of the front line troops and thus we focus on this. The movie is much more political and deals a lot with the political ramifications of what is going on. The biggest protest here is that nobody wants to bring women home in body bags. What the women say is that they can do anything that a man can do, so if a man can be a front line soldier, then a woman should be as well. Starship Troopers actually has women as front line soldiers. We see the main character wanting to be treated like all the other men, but at first she is given help because they feel that she needs it. What she doesn't want is to be treated any differently. The is opposition to what she is doing but it doesn't come out as strong as it did in the previews. In the previews we are led to believe that everywhere she goes she faces opposition, but this is not true. People do try to persuade her from doing it, but she is stubborn and continues. It is the political side of the movie that draws the criticism. The politicians say that they don't want women coming home in body bags. The whole idea is about change and people don't want to do it. Feminisim is a very strong force in today's society and now we are moving further into what originally were male only jobs. Today we see women weightlifters and labourers, but we still don't see women soldiers. In Australia we have women on the naval ships but not in infantry. Now, in this movie, we see the beginnings of a protest against this. The movie itself was a little confusing at times because the characters seem to mumble and it was hard to concentrate with Louisa and Melissa doing their usual girly things behind me, but that was not Ridley Scott's fault. His dark, wet style is very evident here, though it is quite different to Burton's style. Scott focuses more on this protest, and his darkness is much more realistic. Scott seems to keep the movie dark as a symbol of this world where women are not free to do what they like. Scott also seems to like rain because it is raining a lot in this movie. This seems to symbolise the struggle that the soldiers are going through in the training. The training is very hard, and Scott reminds us of this constantly. They eat from bins and go through training to handle torture and capture. They are beaten up, drowned, and pushed to the limit. They say that there is a 60% dropout rate, and most of them want Jane to do it, but she doesn't. She makes it through a large part of the course only to become a political embarrassment.

    This movie is a story that shows the grimy an and gritty parts in war with Demi Moore who is a skilled worker in politics and is trying to help a charismatic and charming soldier. This movie is about what happens in the background when it comes to war. The movie has topnotch actors and they all do a fantastic job but what really makes this movie shine is the dialogue. It's just well written and sharp. A movie by Scott can be a hit or a miss and this one is a hit. It's well directed, well written and acting is topnotch. And watching the progress and direction of the protagonist's ideology is engrossing while he is helping run a campaign. Anyways the dialogue made the movie intriguing and entertaining to just watch and listen to people talk in this. There is other movies that has a similar premise as this with the campaign for presidency and everything but this one really does show the dirty side of politics. Although some parts may seem a bit far-fetched than others. I liked the character development in this and how, you don't know unless your hit a wall or put yourself in others shoes. I would personally watch this movie again later on in the future.

    I finally got around to seeing GI Jane. Quite a good movie - the brutality of the training bits really puts into context what women might face in combat and the "real", not theoretical brutality they face. Unfortunately, an otherwise excellent movie loses out due to a tacked-on and militarily nonsensical battle scene which occupies the last 25 minutes. The movie should have ended after Demi gave the Senator an ultimatum and she is seen, in the distance, rejoining her unit in training. By that point, all of the major hurdles and challenges will have been overcome, and we would know that the future would be there as she was to make it. It would have been a fitting ending. The dumb battle scene in the end was just awful on many levels.

    "I am wrong." Henry said. Henry and Kristl were sitting in their garage turned Cinema. The garage was a workshop with large windows and three sliding doors that was part of a petrol station. Henry and Kristl could rent it for an agreeable price, because the ground was polluted by oil and other fluids associated with cars that had spilled for decades onto the floor and fouled the soil underneath. "We could make it into a public restroom." Henry had said. "We were going to make it into a private cinema?" Kristl answered. "We could make some money on the side to cover our expenses." Henry said. "And who is going to clean this restroom?" Kristl's gaze made Henry think of a snake about to strike. "We could make it automatic, perhaps. "Henry sweat-ed a bit and felt like he had just discovered he was walking in a minefield. "A Henry o'matic." Kristl said with a flat voice.. "Uhmm." "Just wrong. Plain wrong. " Henry continued, "That is why I never get any girl friends." "But I am your friend?" Kristl said. "Yes, but I don't mean a friend friend, but a girl friend friend." "Ah." "A man like me would do something like this." Henry produced out of nowhere a small white dish on which was placed a chocolate &eacute;clair with dark chocolate of such fine color that it made Kristl's mouth water. Next to it was a fine silver spoon, that shone green in the light of the exit sign. Kristl was staring transfixed at the chocolate &eacute;clair. "You see.. I would have the notion that you give this to someone you like and that she, the she being you in this case, would like me for it. Just to be nice." "Who do you want to have killed for that?" Kristl smiled. "I don't want anything for it, you just get it for free because you are my friend. Not a girl friend kinda friend, but a friend friend." "Gracias." Kristl took hold of the dish with a slightly trembling hand. "But I am silly really, because women want to be tough cookies that like to be trounced so you get respect from them and you get trounced by them so they respect you.. And then the greatest praise you can get from them is: 'suck my dick'" Kristl was eyeing her &eacute;clair in a way that clearly showed she had not yet made up her mind to swallow it whole or eat it in small bits. She decided on the latter. "I am overjoyed that US finest troops are in reality dumb gung ho halfwits that are trained to a sharp killer edge by humiliation and torture. Guess that makes a good soldier." "suck my dick?" Henry said, "What does that mean?" "Well, she wants to be man really, so that guy can suck hers or his. I am getting a bit confused." "I was a bit embarrassed when that one guy walks up to her and stammers 'yu are okaj' to her like he was lurch from the Addams Family. I thought well, Seals, aren't they the finest of our men? Somehow Lurch doesn't quite fit in with that picture." "It actually makes me happy. Would be scary to think they were serious experienced intelligent men with a professional attitude. They could be effective and deadly..brr. " Kristl said and continued, "I was a bit annoyed when it was suggested it was bad that she might be a lesbian. Oh my god she is a lesbian! We have to put up with blacks, women, gays and now with lesbian So what does that say: you can be a woman in the army but not when you are a lesbian?" "Imagine being a black lesbian" Henry laughed. "But how do you feel about the whole movie?" "I have to say it was an exceptionally run-of-the-mill movie. I didn't like any of the people in it. They were an amalgam of faces in dark surroundings. Then the movie used all the clich&eacute;s. The politicians who can't be trusted and sell you out if it suits their fancy. The lone hero Jane who, having no experience whatsoever in politics, manipulates that woman, with decades of experience in politics. The cigar crunching commander with the I-don't-like-politics attitude. The drill sergeant who is tough on her but finally grudgingly starts to respect her. The boys who first look down on her and then become her buddies." "Yes, but I think that was all you could do with the story." Henry nodded. "G. I. Jane has proved that us women can be beaten and humiliated as any other man in the army. And isn't this sad? How great is it that such fine intelligent people are wasting their lives on something so utterly needless as the act of waging war? There are people who can contribute something of value to the progress of humanity, but the only thing they learn is 'how to blow things up'. The movie is a hallmark of utter waste: now we women can be as useless as any men because we have equal access to all the branches of the army." "Hurrah for equality." Henry said. "Any more of those &eacute;clairs?" Kristl smiled. "A whole box of them." Henry winked as he showed her the box, "Come and get them." After chasing Henry for five minutes He gave in and handed her the box. "All for equality." Henry said. "Jummy." Said Kristl.

    This one was bound to raise many Red Flags in a lot of Quarters. It is a Movie with a target on its back daring you to shoot. Taking a "Women in Combat" controversy, although it seems less so Today", and shoving it in your Face like a Drill Sergeant daring you to speak out. This Movie is a Noble effort, but it may have aimed a bit too high. The concept here, (just give us an equal chance to be equal) would have been more realistic if Ridley Scott and Writer David Twohy had not chosen the prestigious Navy Seals with its famous dropout rate, and the Elite of the Elite status, as a Battleground for Politics. That takes it to a level of arguable absurdity. It would have been more believable and may have quieted the Nay-Sayers somewhat, if it was simply the U.S. Marines or any other simply difficult and grueling group of the Military's Might. But given that Melodramatic Fiction (see below), this can be inspirational and Entertaining in a Hollywood Underdog Story that it does so well. It is one of Demi Moore's best efforts. THIS IS FROM NAVY.COM......by law there are two communities that women are not allowed to join: the Navy SEAL and Navy SWCC communities.

    This movie is proof that in Hollywood all things are possible. I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays "Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill" who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it "Senator Lillian DeHaven" also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all "gender norms" as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor "Master Chief John James Urgayle" (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one.

    G.I.Jane has some obvious flaws. Not the least of which is when Demi Moore walks into the mess with obviously no bra on under her white tee shirt. No self respecting female trying to get into the world of a macho, hyper-testosterone fueled job would do anything to accentuate her femininity. No makeup,no feminine underwear,nothing that makes her different than a male recruit. A fact shown to good example when Moore shaves all her hair off during a break and I give her credit for actually doing it and not faking it by wearing a wig. That takes guts. As someone who has been through something similar,I can tell you that not being wanted in a group of men elicits a type of behavior in a group mentality that would never happen if the man was alone. I really enjoyed this film despite some of its problems at suspending disbelief. For example, when the master chief is looking at the exercise where the recruits are in the rain, climbing forward on their bellies under barbed wire, he's "seeing" the action that wouldn't be possible through a scope or binoculars. Another is when each team in is the water and picked up "on the go" as the inflatable rafts rush by. Each male is given help by someone inside the raft and hoisted up inside. Yet when Moore's character turn comes, there is no help and she slips back into the water. She's unable to do it but is later criticized by the Master Chief for not being able to lift her "own body weight." Well, we don't know if that's so or not, as all the males were helped getting inside. There are other instances of such examples but the thing that makes this film work for me is I know how it feels to be unwanted and be considered incapable of doing what's considered typically a "man's job." The politics and technical mistakes aside, the real essence of the film is if a woman wants to fight for her country she should be able to.

    The Whole Concept Addressed: This movie must have been put out by some feminist organization trying to promote women in the military into more combat positions. Personally, I don't mind women in the military, but I am against women directly in combat. It's nasty business and no woman should be slinging a gun, going toe and fist; knife in hand on a combat field only to get captured, raped, and tortured by the enemy. What woman in her right mind would want to do this anyway? As for the plot; it was so glamorized by Hollywood & unrealistic, I laughed. Real SEAL CRT Training has little resemblance to the way it is portrayed in this movie. However, the movie keeps you entertained, esp with HOTTIE, Demi Moore. I would say it is worth seeing. A Better alternative to this movie: Act of Valor is about real Navy SEALS in action. Now that is a good movie!

    "G.I. Jane" is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS, the most elite and toughest training. Now, O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and co-written by the creator of the "Chronicles of Riddick" series, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like "Pitch Black" that much, so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it. Demi Moore plays Lieutenant O'Neill, a tough, no-nonsense girl who just wants to get in on the action. Out of all the roles I've seen Demi Moore in, this is my favourite one yet. She's strong-willed, determined, and as the film goes on, she becomes a giant badass. If there was ever a woman's version of "The Expendables", Demi Moore would definitely be in it. She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head, forms abs and gets totally ripped, she is still incredibly hot. Viggo Mortensen plays John, the Master Chief. No, not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen, you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal, mean, and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all, but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword. The atmosphere in this movie is awesome. You're watching all these guys and O'Neill go through boot camp and you're just sitting there going "Yeah, I couldn't do that. That's just gross". Like there's one part where they have five minutes to eat dinner and do they get fresh food? No. They get the scraps from their lunch. So their eating like half eaten corn and weird goop that been sitting there for half a day. I have to be honest, I wouldn't survive 1 day at that place. The last 20 minutes are my least favourite part of the film. It's kind of like "Full Metal Jacket" in the way that once they leave bootcamp, the movie goes downhill. But unlike "Full Metal Jacket", the movie only goes downhill a bit. It was kind of just an excuse to make stuff blow up and have a gunfight but I'm not complaining. Got to say, Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool. Overall, I highly enjoyed "G.I. Jane". I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass, and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on Blu-Ray.

Somehow Lurch doesn't quite fit in with that picture." "It actually makes me happy. Would be scary to think they were serious experienced intelligent men with a professional attitude. They could be effective and deadly..brr. " Kristl said and continued, "I was a bit annoyed when it was suggested it was bad that she might be a lesbian. Oh my god she is a lesbian! We have to put up with blacks, women, gays and now with lesbian So what does that say: you can be a woman in the army but not when you are a lesbian?" "Imagine being a black lesbian" Henry laughed. "But how do you feel about the whole movie?" "I have to say it was an exceptionally run-of-the-mill movie. I didn't like any of the people in it. They were an amalgam of faces in dark surroundings. Then the movie used all the clich&eacute;s. The politicians who can't be trusted and sell you out if it suits their fancy. The lone hero Jane who, having no experience whatsoever in politics, manipulates that woman, with decades of experience in politics. The cigar crunching commander with the I-don't-like-politics attitude. The drill sergeant who is tough on her but finally grudgingly starts to respect her. The boys who first look down on her and then become her buddies." "Yes, but I think that was all you could do with the story." Henry nodded. "G. I. Jane has proved that us women can be beaten and humiliated as any other man in the army. And isn't this sad? How great is it that such fine intelligent people are wasting their lives on something so utterly needless as the act of waging war? There are people who can contribute something of value to the progress of humanity, but the only thing they learn is 'how to blow things up'. The movie is a hallmark of utter waste: now we women can be as useless as any men because we have equal access to all the branches of the army." "Hurrah for equality." Henry said. "Any more of those &eacute;clairs?" Kristl smiled. "A whole box of them." Henry winked as he showed her the box, "Come and get them." After chasing Henry for five minutes He gave in and handed her the box. "All for equality." Henry said. "Jummy." Said Kristl.

    This one was bound to raise many Red Flags in a lot of Quarters. It is a Movie with a target on its back daring you to shoot. Taking a "Women in Combat" controversy, although it seems less so Today", and shoving it in your Face like a Drill Sergeant daring you to speak out. This Movie is a Noble effort, but it may have aimed a bit too high. The concept here, (just give us an equal chance to be equal) would have been more realistic if Ridley Scott and Writer David Twohy had not chosen the prestigious Navy Seals with its famous dropout rate, and the Elite of the Elite status, as a Battleground for Politics. That takes it to a level of arguable absurdity. It would have been more believable and may have quieted the Nay-Sayers somewhat, if it was simply the U.S. Marines or any other simply difficult and grueling group of the Military's Might. But given that Melodramatic Fiction (see below), this can be inspirational and Entertaining in a Hollywood Underdog Story that it does so well. It is one of Demi Moore's best efforts. THIS IS FROM NAVY.COM......by law there are two communities that women are not allowed to join: the Navy SEAL and Navy SWCC communities.

    This movie is proof that in Hollywood all things are possible. I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays "Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill" who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it "Senator Lillian DeHaven" also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all "gender norms" as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor "Master Chief John James Urgayle" (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one.

    G.I.Jane has some obvious flaws. Not the least of which is when Demi Moore walks into the mess with obviously no bra on under her white tee shirt. No self respecting female trying to get into the world of a macho, hyper-testosterone fueled job would do anything to accentuate her femininity. No makeup,no feminine underwear,nothing that makes her different than a male recruit. A fact shown to good example when Moore shaves all her hair off during a break and I give her credit for actually doing it and not faking it by wearing a wig. That takes guts. As someone who has been through something similar,I can tell you that not being wanted in a group of men elicits a type of behavior in a group mentality that would never happen if the man was alone. I really enjoyed this film despite some of its problems at suspending disbelief. For example, when the master chief is looking at the exercise where the recruits are in the rain, climbing forward on their bellies under barbed wire, he's "seeing" the action that wouldn't be possible through a scope or binoculars. Another is when each team in is the water and picked up "on the go" as the inflatable rafts rush by. Each male is given help by someone inside the raft and hoisted up inside. Yet when Moore's character turn comes, there is no help and she slips back into the water. She's unable to do it but is later criticized by the Master Chief for not being able to lift her "own body weight." Well, we don't know if that's so or not, as all the males were helped getting inside. There are other instances of such examples but the thing that makes this film work for me is I know how it feels to be unwanted and be considered incapable of doing what's considered typically a "man's job." The politics and technical mistakes aside, the real essence of the film is if a woman wants to fight for her country she should be able to.

    The Whole Concept Addressed: This movie must have been put out by some feminist organization trying to promote women in the military into more combat positions. Personally, I don't mind women in the military, but I am against women directly in combat. It's nasty business and no woman should be slinging a gun, going toe and fist; knife in hand on a combat field only to get captured, raped, and tortured by the enemy. What woman in her right mind would want to do this anyway? As for the plot; it was so glamorized by Hollywood & unrealistic, I laughed. Real SEAL CRT Training has little resemblance to the way it is portrayed in this movie. However, the movie keeps you entertained, esp with HOTTIE, Demi Moore. I would say it is worth seeing. A Better alternative to this movie: Act of Valor is about real Navy SEALS in action. Now that is a good movie!

    "G.I. Jane" is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS, the most elite and toughest training. Now, O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and co-written by the creator of the "Chronicles of Riddick" series, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like "Pitch Black" that much, so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it. Demi Moore plays Lieutenant O'Neill, a tough, no-nonsense girl who just wants to get in on the action. Out of all the roles I've seen Demi Moore in, this is my favourite one yet. She's strong-willed, determined, and as the film goes on, she becomes a giant badass. If there was ever a woman's version of "The Expendables", Demi Moore would definitely be in it. She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head, forms abs and gets totally ripped, she is still incredibly hot. Viggo Mortensen plays John, the Master Chief. No, not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen, you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal, mean, and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all, but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword. The atmosphere in this movie is awesome. You're watching all these guys and O'Neill go through boot camp and you're just sitting there going "Yeah, I couldn't do that. That's just gross". Like there's one part where they have five minutes to eat dinner and do they get fresh food? No. They get the scraps from their lunch. So their eating like half eaten corn and weird goop that been sitting there for half a day. I have to be honest, I wouldn't survive 1 day at that place. The last 20 minutes are my least favourite part of the film. It's kind of like "Full Metal Jacket" in the way that once they leave bootcamp, the movie goes downhill. But unlike "Full Metal Jacket", the movie only goes downhill a bit. It was kind of just an excuse to make stuff blow up and have a gunfight but I'm not complaining. Got to say, Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool. Overall, I highly enjoyed "G.I. Jane". I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass, and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on Blu-Ray.

    The first thing that I heard about this movie was that the US Navy was opposed to making it and was very resistant to allowing Scott to use any of their facilities. I don't know what happened in the end but they seemed to be using some pretty hi-tech weaponry. One just doesn't walk down to a corner store and buy an Apache, though I thought the Apache was being used very ineffectively in the situation. Basically the Navy Seals were being pursued by a Lybian border patrol and they were on foot, so the Apache was firing missiles. I would have used the chain gun because it is much more effective against infantry than missiles, missiles are for tanks and other vehicles. G.I. Jane is a protest movie and it is about women in the military in front line jobs. The Navy Seals are said to be the best of the front line troops and thus we focus on this. The movie is much more political and deals a lot with the political ramifications of what is going on. The biggest protest here is that nobody wants to bring women home in body bags. What the women say is that they can do anything that a man can do, so if a man can be a front line soldier, then a woman should be as well. Starship Troopers actually has women as front line soldiers. We see the main character wanting to be treated like all the other men, but at first she is given help because they feel that she needs it. What she doesn't want is to be treated any differently. The is opposition to what she is doing but it doesn't come out as strong as it did in the previews. In the previews we are led to believe that everywhere she goes she faces opposition, but this is not true. People do try to persuade her from doing it, but she is stubborn and continues. It is the political side of the movie that draws the criticism. The politicians say that they don't want women coming home in body bags. The whole idea is about change and people don't want to do it. Feminisim is a very strong force in today's society and now we are moving further into what originally were male only jobs. Today we see women weightlifters and labourers, but we still don't see women soldiers. In Australia we have women on the naval ships but not in infantry. Now, in this movie, we see the beginnings of a protest against this. The movie itself was a little confusing at times because the characters seem to mumble and it was hard to concentrate with Louisa and Melissa doing their usual girly things behind me, but that was not Ridley Scott's fault. His dark, wet style is very evident here, though it is quite different to Burton's style. Scott focuses more on this protest, and his darkness is much more realistic. Scott seems to keep the movie dark as a symbol of this world where women are not free to do what they like. Scott also seems to like rain because it is raining a lot in this movie. This seems to symbolise the struggle that the soldiers are going through in the training. The training is very hard, and Scott reminds us of this constantly. They eat from bins and go through training to handle torture and capture. They are beaten up, drowned, and pushed to the limit. They say that there is a 60% dropout rate, and most of them want Jane to do it, but she doesn't. She makes it through a large part of the course only to become a political embarrassment.

    Lovely for the game between dreams of childhood and the facts of old age. Poetry in skin of nostalgic nuances. Comedy and emotional travel, adventures with Jules Verne taste and bridges between visions of a female buck private and an old man.The empty heard of dream and forms of escape. Mixture of feelings, colors and ingenuity. And delicate form to tell a special story, no different of many others but full of lights of life sense.A movie for lost ages. Or guide for teenagers. Picture of cocoon steps and discover of basic parts of happiness. Map of way of life and scene of intre ballistic missiles fly. A snail and its wings. And the beauty of truth behind any appearance. The rest - silence. Joy of an experience .

    This movie is a story that shows the grimy an and gritty parts in war with Demi Moore who is a skilled worker in politics and is trying to help a charismatic and charming soldier. This movie is about what happens in the background when it comes to war. The movie has topnotch actors and they all do a fantastic job but what really makes this movie shine is the dialogue. It's just well written and sharp. A movie by Scott can be a hit or a miss and this one is a hit. It's well directed, well written and acting is topnotch. And watching the progress and direction of the protagonist's ideology is engrossing while he is helping run a campaign. Anyways the dialogue made the movie intriguing and entertaining to just watch and listen to people talk in this. There is other movies that has a similar premise as this with the campaign for presidency and everything but this one really does show the dirty side of politics. Although some parts may seem a bit far-fetched than others. I liked the character development in this and how, you don't know unless your hit a wall or put yourself in others shoes. I would personally watch this movie again later on in the future.

    I finally got around to seeing GI Jane. Quite a good movie - the brutality of the training bits really puts into context what women might face in combat and the "real", not theoretical brutality they face. Unfortunately, an otherwise excellent movie loses out due to a tacked-on and militarily nonsensical battle scene which occupies the last 25 minutes. The movie should have ended after Demi gave the Senator an ultimatum and she is seen, in the distance, rejoining her unit in training. By that point, all of the major hurdles and challenges will have been overcome, and we would know that the future would be there as she was to make it. It would have been a fitting ending. The dumb battle scene in the end was just awful on many levels.

    "I am wrong." Henry said. Henry and Kristl were sitting in their garage turned Cinema. The garage was a workshop with large windows and three sliding doors that was part of a petrol station. Henry and Kristl could rent it for an agreeable price, because the ground was polluted by oil and other fluids associated with cars that had spilled for decades onto the floor and fouled the soil underneath. "We could make it into a public restroom." Henry had said. "We were going to make it into a private cinema?" Kristl answered. "We could make some money on the side to cover our expenses." Henry said. "And who is going to clean this restroom?" Kristl's gaze made Henry think of a snake about to strike. "We could make it automatic, perhaps. "Henry sweat-ed a bit and felt like he had just discovered he was walking in a minefield. "A Henry o'matic." Kristl said with a flat voice.. "Uhmm." "Just wrong. Plain wrong. " Henry continued, "That is why I never get any girl friends." "But I am your friend?" Kristl said. "Yes, but I don't mean a friend friend, but a girl friend friend." "Ah." "A man like me would do something like this." Henry produced out of nowhere a small white dish on which was placed a chocolate &eacute;clair with dark chocolate of such fine color that it made Kristl's mouth water. Next to it was a fine silver spoon, that shone green in the light of the exit sign. Kristl was staring transfixed at the chocolate &eacute;clair. "You see.. I would have the notion that you give this to someone you like and that she, the she being you in this case, would like me for it. Just to be nice." "Who do you want to have killed for that?" Kristl smiled. "I don't want anything for it, you just get it for free because you are my friend. Not a girl friend kinda friend, but a friend friend." "Gracias." Kristl took hold of the dish with a slightly trembling hand. "But I am silly really, because women want to be tough cookies that like to be trounced so you get respect from them and you get trounced by them so they respect you.. And then the greatest praise you can get from them is: 'suck my dick'" Kristl was eyeing her &eacute;clair in a way that clearly showed she had not yet made up her mind to swallow it whole or eat it in small bits. She decided on the latter. "I am overjoyed that US finest troops are in reality dumb gung ho halfwits that are trained to a sharp killer edge by humiliation and torture. Guess that makes a good soldier." "suck my dick?" Henry said, "What does that mean?" "Well, she wants to be man really, so that guy can suck hers or his. I am getting a bit confused." "I was a bit embarrassed when that one guy walks up to her and stammers 'yu are okaj' to her like he was lurch from the Addams Family. I thought well, Seals, aren't they the finest of our men? Somehow Lurch doesn't quite fit in with that picture." "It actually makes me happy. Would be scary to think they were serious experienced intelligent men with a professional attitude. They could be effective and deadly..brr. " Kristl said and continued, "I was a bit annoyed when it was suggested it was bad that she might be a lesbian. Oh my god she is a lesbian! We have to put up with blacks, women, gays and now with lesbian So what does that say: you can be a woman in the army but not when you are a lesbian?" "Imagine being a black lesbian" Henry laughed. "But how do you feel about the whole movie?" "I have to say it was an exceptionally run-of-the-mill movie. I didn't like any of the people in it. They were an amalgam of faces in dark surroundings.

The boys who first look down on her and then become her buddies." "Yes, but I think that was all you could do with the story." Henry nodded. "G. I. Jane has proved that us women can be beaten and humiliated as any other man in the army. And isn't this sad? How great is it that such fine intelligent people are wasting their lives on something so utterly needless as the act of waging war?

The movie is a hallmark of utter waste: now we women can be as useless as any men because we have equal access to all the branches of the army." "Hurrah for equality." Henry said. "Any more of those &eacute;clairs?" Kristl smiled. "A whole box of them." Henry winked as he showed her the box, "Come and get them." After chasing Henry for five minutes He gave in and handed her the box. "All for equality." Henry said. "Jummy." Said Kristl.

    "G.I. Jane" is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS, the most elite and toughest training. Now, O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and co-written by the creator of the "Chronicles of Riddick" series, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like "Pitch Black" that much, so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it. Demi Moore plays Lieutenant O'Neill, a tough, no-nonsense girl who just wants to get in on the action. Out of all the roles I've seen Demi Moore in, this is my favourite one yet. She's strong-willed, determined, and as the film goes on, she becomes a giant badass. If there was ever a woman's version of "The Expendables", Demi Moore would definitely be in it. She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head, forms abs and gets totally ripped, she is still incredibly hot. Viggo Mortensen plays John, the Master Chief. No, not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen, you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal, mean, and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all, but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword. The atmosphere in this movie is awesome. You're watching all these guys and O'Neill go through boot camp and you're just sitting there going "Yeah, I couldn't do that. That's just gross". Like there's one part where they have five minutes to eat dinner and do they get fresh food? No. They get the scraps from their lunch. So their eating like half eaten corn and weird goop that been sitting there for half a day. I have to be honest, I wouldn't survive 1 day at that place. The last 20 minutes are my least favourite part of the film. It's kind of like "Full Metal Jacket" in the way that once they leave bootcamp, the movie goes downhill. But unlike "Full Metal Jacket", the movie only goes downhill a bit. It was kind of just an excuse to make stuff blow up and have a gunfight but I'm not complaining. Got to say, Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool. Overall, I highly enjoyed "G.I. Jane". I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass, and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on Blu-Ray.

    The first thing that I heard about this movie was that the US Navy was opposed to making it and was very resistant to allowing Scott to use any of their facilities. I don't know what happened in the end but they seemed to be using some pretty hi-tech weaponry. One just doesn't walk down to a corner store and buy an Apache, though I thought the Apache was being used very ineffectively in the situation. Basically the Navy Seals were being pursued by a Lybian border patrol and they were on foot, so the Apache was firing missiles. I would have used the chain gun because it is much more effective against infantry than missiles, missiles are for tanks and other vehicles. G.I. Jane is a protest movie and it is about women in the military in front line jobs. The Navy Seals are said to be the best of the front line troops and thus we focus on this. The movie is much more political and deals a lot with the political ramifications of what is going on. The biggest protest here is that nobody wants to bring women home in body bags. What the women say is that they can do anything that a man can do, so if a man can be a front line soldier, then a woman should be as well. Starship Troopers actually has women as front line soldiers. We see the main character wanting to be treated like all the other men, but at first she is given help because they feel that she needs it. What she doesn't want is to be treated any differently. The is opposition to what she is doing but it doesn't come out as strong as it did in the previews. In the previews we are led to believe that everywhere she goes she faces opposition, but this is not true. People do try to persuade her from doing it, but she is stubborn and continues. It is the political side of the movie that draws the criticism. The politicians say that they don't want women coming home in body bags. The whole idea is about change and people don't want to do it. Feminisim is a very strong force in today's society and now we are moving further into what originally were male only jobs. Today we see women weightlifters and labourers, but we still don't see women soldiers. In Australia we have women on the naval ships but not in infantry. Now, in this movie, we see the beginnings of a protest against this. The movie itself was a little confusing at times because the characters seem to mumble and it was hard to concentrate with Louisa and Melissa doing their usual girly things behind me, but that was not Ridley Scott's fault. His dark, wet style is very evident here, though it is quite different to Burton's style. Scott focuses more on this protest, and his darkness is much more realistic. Scott seems to keep the movie dark as a symbol of this world where women are not free to do what they like. Scott also seems to like rain because it is raining a lot in this movie. This seems to symbolise the struggle that the soldiers are going through in the training. The training is very hard, and Scott reminds us of this constantly. They eat from bins and go through training to handle torture and capture. They are beaten up, drowned, and pushed to the limit. They say that there is a 60% dropout rate, and most of them want Jane to do it, but she doesn't. She makes it through a large part of the course only to become a political embarrassment.

    This movie is a story that shows the grimy an and gritty parts in war with Demi Moore who is a skilled worker in politics and is trying to help a charismatic and charming soldier. This movie is about what happens in the background when it comes to war. The movie has topnotch actors and they all do a fantastic job but what really makes this movie shine is the dialogue. It's just well written and sharp. A movie by Scott can be a hit or a miss and this one is a hit. It's well directed, well written and acting is topnotch. And watching the progress and direction of the protagonist's ideology is engrossing while he is helping run a campaign. Anyways the dialogue made the movie intriguing and entertaining to just watch and listen to people talk in this. There is other movies that has a similar premise as this with the campaign for presidency and everything but this one really does show the dirty side of politics. Although some parts may seem a bit far-fetched than others. I liked the character development in this and how, you don't know unless your hit a wall or put yourself in others shoes. I would personally watch this movie again later on in the future.

    I finally got around to seeing GI Jane. Quite a good movie - the brutality of the training bits really puts into context what women might face in combat and the "real", not theoretical brutality they face. Unfortunately, an otherwise excellent movie loses out due to a tacked-on and militarily nonsensical battle scene which occupies the last 25 minutes. The movie should have ended after Demi gave the Senator an ultimatum and she is seen, in the distance, rejoining her unit in training. By that point, all of the major hurdles and challenges will have been overcome, and we would know that the future would be there as she was to make it. It would have been a fitting ending. The dumb battle scene in the end was just awful on many levels.

    "I am wrong." Henry said. Henry and Kristl were sitting in their garage turned Cinema. The garage was a workshop with large windows and three sliding doors that was part of a petrol station. Henry and Kristl could rent it for an agreeable price, because the ground was polluted by oil and other fluids associated with cars that had spilled for decades onto the floor and fouled the soil underneath. "We could make it into a public restroom." Henry had said. "We were going to make it into a private cinema?" Kristl answered. "We could make some money on the side to cover our expenses." Henry said. "And who is going to clean this restroom?" Kristl's gaze made Henry think of a snake about to strike. "We could make it automatic, perhaps. "Henry sweat-ed a bit and felt like he had just discovered he was walking in a minefield. "A Henry o'matic." Kristl said with a flat voice.. "Uhmm." "Just wrong. Plain wrong. " Henry continued, "That is why I never get any girl friends." "But I am your friend?" Kristl said. "Yes, but I don't mean a friend friend, but a girl friend friend." "Ah." "A man like me would do something like this." Henry produced out of nowhere a small white dish on which was placed a chocolate &eacute;clair with dark chocolate of such fine color that it made Kristl's mouth water. Next to it was a fine silver spoon, that shone green in the light of the exit sign. Kristl was staring transfixed at the chocolate &eacute;clair. "You see.. I would have the notion that you give this to someone you like and that she, the she being you in this case, would like me for it. Just to be nice." "Who do you want to have killed for that?" Kristl smiled. "I don't want anything for it, you just get it for free because you are my friend. Not a girl friend kinda friend, but a friend friend." "Gracias." Kristl took hold of the dish with a slightly trembling hand. "But I am silly really, because women want to be tough cookies that like to be trounced so you get respect from them and you get trounced by them so they respect you.. And then the greatest praise you can get from them is: 'suck my dick'" Kristl was eyeing her &eacute;clair in a way that clearly showed she had not yet made up her mind to swallow it whole or eat it in small bits. She decided on the latter. "I am overjoyed that US finest troops are in reality dumb gung ho halfwits that are trained to a sharp killer edge by humiliation and torture. Guess that makes a good soldier." "suck my dick?" Henry said, "What does that mean?" "Well, she wants to be man really, so that guy can suck hers or his. I am getting a bit confused." "I was a bit embarrassed when that one guy walks up to her and stammers 'yu are okaj' to her like he was lurch from the Addams Family. I thought well, Seals, aren't they the finest of our men? Somehow Lurch doesn't quite fit in with that picture." "It actually makes me happy. Would be scary to think they were serious experienced intelligent men with a professional attitude. They could be effective and deadly..brr. " Kristl said and continued, "I was a bit annoyed when it was suggested it was bad that she might be a lesbian. Oh my god she is a lesbian! We have to put up with blacks, women, gays and now with lesbian So what does that say: you can be a woman in the army but not when you are a lesbian?" "Imagine being a black lesbian" Henry laughed. "But how do you feel about the whole movie?" "I have to say it was an exceptionally run-of-the-mill movie. I didn't like any of the people in it. They were an amalgam of faces in dark surroundings. Then the movie used all the clich&eacute;s. The politicians who can't be trusted and sell you out if it suits their fancy. The lone hero Jane who, having no experience whatsoever in politics, manipulates that woman, with decades of experience in politics. The cigar crunching commander with the I-don't-like-politics attitude. The drill sergeant who is tough on her but finally grudgingly starts to respect her. The boys who first look down on her and then become her buddies." "Yes, but I think that was all you could do with the story." Henry nodded. "G. I. Jane has proved that us women can be beaten and humiliated as any other man in the army. And isn't this sad? How great is it that such fine intelligent people are wasting their lives on something so utterly needless as the act of waging war? There are people who can contribute something of value to the progress of humanity, but the only thing they learn is 'how to blow things up'. The movie is a hallmark of utter waste: now we women can be as useless as any men because we have equal access to all the branches of the army." "Hurrah for equality." Henry said. "Any more of those &eacute;clairs?" Kristl smiled. "A whole box of them." Henry winked as he showed her the box, "Come and get them." After chasing Henry for five minutes He gave in and handed her the box. "All for equality." Henry said. "Jummy." Said Kristl.

    This one was bound to raise many Red Flags in a lot of Quarters. It is a Movie with a target on its back daring you to shoot. Taking a "Women in Combat" controversy, although it seems less so Today", and shoving it in your Face like a Drill Sergeant daring you to speak out. This Movie is a Noble effort, but it may have aimed a bit too high. The concept here, (just give us an equal chance to be equal) would have been more realistic if Ridley Scott and Writer David Twohy had not chosen the prestigious Navy Seals with its famous dropout rate, and the Elite of the Elite status, as a Battleground for Politics. That takes it to a level of arguable absurdity. It would have been more believable and may have quieted the Nay-Sayers somewhat, if it was simply the U.S. Marines or any other simply difficult and grueling group of the Military's Might. But given that Melodramatic Fiction (see below), this can be inspirational and Entertaining in a Hollywood Underdog Story that it does so well. It is one of Demi Moore's best efforts. THIS IS FROM NAVY.COM......by law there are two communities that women are not allowed to join: the Navy SEAL and Navy SWCC communities.

    This movie is proof that in Hollywood all things are possible. I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays "Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill" who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it "Senator Lillian DeHaven" also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all "gender norms" as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor "Master Chief John James Urgayle" (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one.

    G.I.Jane has some obvious flaws. Not the least of which is when Demi Moore walks into the mess with obviously no bra on under her white tee shirt. No self respecting female trying to get into the world of a macho, hyper-testosterone fueled job would do anything to accentuate her femininity. No makeup,no feminine underwear,nothing that makes her different than a male recruit. A fact shown to good example when Moore shaves all her hair off during a break and I give her credit for actually doing it and not faking it by wearing a wig. That takes guts. As someone who has been through something similar,I can tell you that not being wanted in a group of men elicits a type of behavior in a group mentality that would never happen if the man was alone. I really enjoyed this film despite some of its problems at suspending disbelief. For example, when the master chief is looking at the exercise where the recruits are in the rain, climbing forward on their bellies under barbed wire, he's "seeing" the action that wouldn't be possible through a scope or binoculars. Another is when each team in is the water and picked up "on the go" as the inflatable rafts rush by. Each male is given help by someone inside the raft and hoisted up inside. Yet when Moore's character turn comes, there is no help and she slips back into the water. She's unable to do it but is later criticized by the Master Chief for not being able to lift her "own body weight." Well, we don't know if that's so or not, as all the males were helped getting inside. There are other instances of such examples but the thing that makes this film work for me is I know how it feels to be unwanted and be considered incapable of doing what's considered typically a "man's job." The politics and technical mistakes aside, the real essence of the film is if a woman wants to fight for her country she should be able to.

    The Whole Concept Addressed: This movie must have been put out by some feminist organization trying to promote women in the military into more combat positions. Personally, I don't mind women in the military, but I am against women directly in combat. It's nasty business and no woman should be slinging a gun, going toe and fist; knife in hand on a combat field only to get captured, raped, and tortured by the enemy. What woman in her right mind would want to do this anyway? As for the plot; it was so glamorized by Hollywood & unrealistic, I laughed. Real SEAL CRT Training has little resemblance to the way it is portrayed in this movie. However, the movie keeps you entertained, esp with HOTTIE, Demi Moore. I would say it is worth seeing. A Better alternative to this movie: Act of Valor is about real Navy SEALS in action. Now that is a good movie!

    "G.I. Jane" is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS, the most elite and toughest training. Now, O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and co-written by the creator of the "Chronicles of Riddick" series, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like "Pitch Black" that much, so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it.

She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head, forms abs and gets totally ripped, she is still incredibly hot. Viggo Mortensen plays John, the Master Chief. No, not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen, you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal, mean, and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all, but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword.

Unfortunately, an otherwise excellent movie loses out due to a tacked-on and militarily nonsensical battle scene which occupies the last 25 minutes.

By that point, all of the major hurdles and challenges will have been overcome, and we would know that the future would be there as she was to make it. It would have been a fitting ending. The dumb battle scene in the end was just awful on many levels.

    "I am wrong." Henry said. Henry and Kristl were sitting in their garage turned Cinema. The garage was a workshop with large windows and three sliding doors that was part of a petrol station. Henry and Kristl could rent it for an agreeable price, because the ground was polluted by oil and other fluids associated with cars that had spilled for decades onto the floor and fouled the soil underneath. "We could make it into a public restroom." Henry had said. "We were going to make it into a private cinema?" Kristl answered. "We could make some money on the side to cover our expenses." Henry said. "And who is going to clean this restroom?" Kristl's gaze made Henry think of a snake about to strike. "We could make it automatic, perhaps. "Henry sweat-ed a bit and felt like he had just discovered he was walking in a minefield. "A Henry o'matic." Kristl said with a flat voice.. "Uhmm." "Just wrong. Plain wrong. " Henry continued, "That is why I never get any girl friends." "But I am your friend?" Kristl said. "Yes, but I don't mean a friend friend, but a girl friend friend." "Ah." "A man like me would do something like this." Henry produced out of nowhere a small white dish on which was placed a chocolate &eacute;clair with dark chocolate of such fine color that it made Kristl's mouth water. Next to it was a fine silver spoon, that shone green in the light of the exit sign. Kristl was staring transfixed at the chocolate &eacute;clair. "You see.. I would have the notion that you give this to someone you like and that she, the she being you in this case, would like me for it. Just to be nice." "Who do you want to have killed for that?" Kristl smiled. "I don't want anything for it, you just get it for free because you are my friend. Not a girl friend kinda friend, but a friend friend." "Gracias." Kristl took hold of the dish with a slightly trembling hand. "But I am silly really, because women want to be tough cookies that like to be trounced so you get respect from them and you get trounced by them so they respect you.. And then the greatest praise you can get from them is: 'suck my dick'" Kristl was eyeing her &eacute;clair in a way that clearly showed she had not yet made up her mind to swallow it whole or eat it in small bits. She decided on the latter. "I am overjoyed that US finest troops are in reality dumb gung ho halfwits that are trained to a sharp killer edge by humiliation and torture. Guess that makes a good soldier." "suck my dick?" Henry said, "What does that mean?" "Well, she wants to be man really, so that guy can suck hers or his. I am getting a bit confused." "I was a bit embarrassed when that one guy walks up to her and stammers 'yu are okaj' to her like he was lurch from the Addams Family. I thought well, Seals, aren't they the finest of our men? Somehow Lurch doesn't quite fit in with that picture." "It actually makes me happy. Would be scary to think they were serious experienced intelligent men with a professional attitude. They could be effective and deadly..brr. " Kristl said and continued, "I was a bit annoyed when it was suggested it was bad that she might be a lesbian. Oh my god she is a lesbian! We have to put up with blacks, women, gays and now with lesbian So what does that say: you can be a woman in the army but not when you are a lesbian?" "Imagine being a black lesbian" Henry laughed. "But how do you feel about the whole movie?" "I have to say it was an exceptionally run-of-the-mill movie. I didn't like any of the people in it. They were an amalgam of faces in dark surroundings. Then the movie used all the clich&eacute;s. The politicians who can't be trusted and sell you out if it suits their fancy. The lone hero Jane who, having no experience whatsoever in politics, manipulates that woman, with decades of experience in politics. The cigar crunching commander with the I-don't-like-politics attitude. The drill sergeant who is tough on her but finally grudgingly starts to respect her. The boys who first look down on her and then become her buddies." "Yes, but I think that was all you could do with the story." Henry nodded. "G. I. Jane has proved that us women can be beaten and humiliated as any other man in the army. And isn't this sad? How great is it that such fine intelligent people are wasting their lives on something so utterly needless as the act of waging war? There are people who can contribute something of value to the progress of humanity, but the only thing they learn is 'how to blow things up'. The movie is a hallmark of utter waste: now we women can be as useless as any men because we have equal access to all the branches of the army." "Hurrah for equality." Henry said. "Any more of those &eacute;clairs?" Kristl smiled. "A whole box of them." Henry winked as he showed her the box, "Come and get them." After chasing Henry for five minutes He gave in and handed her the box. "All for equality." Henry said. "Jummy." Said Kristl.

    This one was bound to raise many Red Flags in a lot of Quarters. It is a Movie with a target on its back daring you to shoot. Taking a "Women in Combat" controversy, although it seems less so Today", and shoving it in your Face like a Drill Sergeant daring you to speak out. This Movie is a Noble effort, but it may have aimed a bit too high. The concept here, (just give us an equal chance to be equal) would have been more realistic if Ridley Scott and Writer David Twohy had not chosen the prestigious Navy Seals with its famous dropout rate, and the Elite of the Elite status, as a Battleground for Politics. That takes it to a level of arguable absurdity. It would have been more believable and may have quieted the Nay-Sayers somewhat, if it was simply the U.S. Marines or any other simply difficult and grueling group of the Military's Might. But given that Melodramatic Fiction (see below), this can be inspirational and Entertaining in a Hollywood Underdog Story that it does so well. It is one of Demi Moore's best efforts. THIS IS FROM NAVY.COM......by law there are two communities that women are not allowed to join: the Navy SEAL and Navy SWCC communities.

    This movie is proof that in Hollywood all things are possible. I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays "Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill" who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it "Senator Lillian DeHaven" also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all "gender norms" as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor "Master Chief John James Urgayle" (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one.

    G.I.Jane has some obvious flaws. Not the least of which is when Demi Moore walks into the mess with obviously no bra on under her white tee shirt. No self respecting female trying to get into the world of a macho, hyper-testosterone fueled job would do anything to accentuate her femininity. No makeup,no feminine underwear,nothing that makes her different than a male recruit. A fact shown to good example when Moore shaves all her hair off during a break and I give her credit for actually doing it and not faking it by wearing a wig. That takes guts. As someone who has been through something similar,I can tell you that not being wanted in a group of men elicits a type of behavior in a group mentality that would never happen if the man was alone. I really enjoyed this film despite some of its problems at suspending disbelief. For example, when the master chief is looking at the exercise where the recruits are in the rain, climbing forward on their bellies under barbed wire, he's "seeing" the action that wouldn't be possible through a scope or binoculars. Another is when each team in is the water and picked up "on the go" as the inflatable rafts rush by. Each male is given help by someone inside the raft and hoisted up inside. Yet when Moore's character turn comes, there is no help and she slips back into the water. She's unable to do it but is later criticized by the Master Chief for not being able to lift her "own body weight." Well, we don't know if that's so or not, as all the males were helped getting inside. There are other instances of such examples but the thing that makes this film work for me is I know how it feels to be unwanted and be considered incapable of doing what's considered typically a "man's job." The politics and technical mistakes aside, the real essence of the film is if a woman wants to fight for her country she should be able to.

    The Whole Concept Addressed: This movie must have been put out by some feminist organization trying to promote women in the military into more combat positions. Personally, I don't mind women in the military, but I am against women directly in combat. It's nasty business and no woman should be slinging a gun, going toe and fist; knife in hand on a combat field only to get captured, raped, and tortured by the enemy. What woman in her right mind would want to do this anyway? As for the plot; it was so glamorized by Hollywood & unrealistic, I laughed. Real SEAL CRT Training has little resemblance to the way it is portrayed in this movie. However, the movie keeps you entertained, esp with HOTTIE, Demi Moore. I would say it is worth seeing. A Better alternative to this movie: Act of Valor is about real Navy SEALS in action. Now that is a good movie!

    "G.I. Jane" is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS, the most elite and toughest training. Now, O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and co-written by the creator of the "Chronicles of Riddick" series, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like "Pitch Black" that much, so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it. Demi Moore plays Lieutenant O'Neill, a tough, no-nonsense girl who just wants to get in on the action. Out of all the roles I've seen Demi Moore in, this is my favourite one yet. She's strong-willed, determined, and as the film goes on, she becomes a giant badass. If there was ever a woman's version of "The Expendables", Demi Moore would definitely be in it. She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head, forms abs and gets totally ripped, she is still incredibly hot. Viggo Mortensen plays John, the Master Chief. No, not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen, you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal, mean, and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all, but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword. The atmosphere in this movie is awesome. You're watching all these guys and O'Neill go through boot camp and you're just sitting there going "Yeah, I couldn't do that. That's just gross". Like there's one part where they have five minutes to eat dinner and do they get fresh food? No. They get the scraps from their lunch. So their eating like half eaten corn and weird goop that been sitting there for half a day. I have to be honest, I wouldn't survive 1 day at that place. The last 20 minutes are my least favourite part of the film. It's kind of like "Full Metal Jacket" in the way that once they leave bootcamp, the movie goes downhill. But unlike "Full Metal Jacket", the movie only goes downhill a bit. It was kind of just an excuse to make stuff blow up and have a gunfight but I'm not complaining. Got to say, Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool. Overall, I highly enjoyed "G.I. Jane". I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass, and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on Blu-Ray.

    The first thing that I heard about this movie was that the US Navy was opposed to making it and was very resistant to allowing Scott to use any of their facilities. I don't know what happened in the end but they seemed to be using some pretty hi-tech weaponry. One just doesn't walk down to a corner store and buy an Apache, though I thought the Apache was being used very ineffectively in the situation. Basically the Navy Seals were being pursued by a Lybian border patrol and they were on foot, so the Apache was firing missiles. I would have used the chain gun because it is much more effective against infantry than missiles, missiles are for tanks and other vehicles. G.I. Jane is a protest movie and it is about women in the military in front line jobs. The Navy Seals are said to be the best of the front line troops and thus we focus on this. The movie is much more political and deals a lot with the political ramifications of what is going on. The biggest protest here is that nobody wants to bring women home in body bags. What the women say is that they can do anything that a man can do, so if a man can be a front line soldier, then a woman should be as well. Starship Troopers actually has women as front line soldiers. We see the main character wanting to be treated like all the other men, but at first she is given help because they feel that she needs it. What she doesn't want is to be treated any differently. The is opposition to what she is doing but it doesn't come out as strong as it did in the previews. In the previews we are led to believe that everywhere she goes she faces opposition, but this is not true. People do try to persuade her from doing it, but she is stubborn and continues. It is the political side of the movie that draws the criticism. The politicians say that they don't want women coming home in body bags. The whole idea is about change and people don't want to do it. Feminisim is a very strong force in today's society and now we are moving further into what originally were male only jobs. Today we see women weightlifters and labourers, but we still don't see women soldiers. In Australia we have women on the naval ships but not in infantry. Now, in this movie, we see the beginnings of a protest against this. The movie itself was a little confusing at times because the characters seem to mumble and it was hard to concentrate with Louisa and Melissa doing their usual girly things behind me, but that was not Ridley Scott's fault. His dark, wet style is very evident here, though it is quite different to Burton's style. Scott focuses more on this protest, and his darkness is much more realistic. Scott seems to keep the movie dark as a symbol of this world where women are not free to do what they like. Scott also seems to like rain because it is raining a lot in this movie. This seems to symbolise the struggle that the soldiers are going through in the training. The training is very hard, and Scott reminds us of this constantly. They eat from bins and go through training to handle torture and capture. They are beaten up, drowned, and pushed to the limit. They say that there is a 60% dropout rate, and most of them want Jane to do it, but she doesn't. She makes it through a large part of the course only to become a political embarrassment.

    Lovely for the game between dreams of childhood and the facts of old age. Poetry in skin of nostalgic nuances. Comedy and emotional travel, adventures with Jules Verne taste and bridges between visions of a female buck private and an old man.The empty heard of dream and forms of escape. Mixture of feelings, colors and ingenuity. And delicate form to tell a special story, no different of many others but full of lights of life sense.A movie for lost ages. Or guide for teenagers. Picture of cocoon steps and discover of basic parts of happiness. Map of way of life and scene of intre ballistic missiles fly. A snail and its wings. And the beauty of truth behind any appearance. The rest - silence. Joy of an experience .

    This movie is a story that shows the grimy an and gritty parts in war with Demi Moore who is a skilled worker in politics and is trying to help a charismatic and charming soldier. This movie is about what happens in the background when it comes to war. The movie has topnotch actors and they all do a fantastic job but what really makes this movie shine is the dialogue. It's just well written and sharp. A movie by Scott can be a hit or a miss and this one is a hit. It's well directed, well written and acting is topnotch. And watching the progress and direction of the protagonist's ideology is engrossing while he is helping run a campaign. Anyways the dialogue made the movie intriguing and entertaining to just watch and listen to people talk in this. There is other movies that has a similar premise as this with the campaign for presidency and everything but this one really does show the dirty side of politics. Although some parts may seem a bit far-fetched than others. I liked the character development in this and how, you don't know unless your hit a wall or put yourself in others shoes. I would personally watch this movie again later on in the future.

    I finally got around to seeing GI Jane. Quite a good movie - the brutality of the training bits really puts into context what women might face in combat and the "real", not theoretical brutality they face. Unfortunately, an otherwise excellent movie loses out due to a tacked-on and militarily nonsensical battle scene which occupies the last 25 minutes. The movie should have ended after Demi gave the Senator an ultimatum and she is seen, in the distance, rejoining her unit in training. By that point, all of the major hurdles and challenges will have been overcome, and we would know that the future would be there as she was to make it. It would have been a fitting ending. The dumb battle scene in the end was just awful on many levels.

No makeup,no feminine underwear,nothing that makes her different than a male recruit. A fact shown to good example when Moore shaves all her hair off during a break and I give her credit for actually doing it and not faking it by wearing a wig. That takes guts. As someone who has been through something similar,I can tell you that not being wanted in a group of men elicits a type of behavior in a group mentality that would never happen if the man was alone. I really enjoyed this film despite some of its problems at suspending disbelief. For example, when the master chief is looking at the exercise where the recruits are in the rain, climbing forward on their bellies under barbed wire, he's "seeing" the action that wouldn't be possible through a scope or binoculars. Another is when each team in is the water and picked up "on the go" as the inflatable rafts rush by. Each male is given help by someone inside the raft and hoisted up inside. Yet when Moore's character turn comes, there is no help and she slips back into the water. She's unable to do it but is later criticized by the Master Chief for not being able to lift her "own body weight." Well, we don't know if that's so or not, as all the males were helped getting inside. There are other instances of such examples but the thing that makes this film work for me is I know how it feels to be unwanted and be considered incapable of doing what's considered typically a "man's job." The politics and technical mistakes aside, the real essence of the film is if a woman wants to fight for her country she should be able to.

    The Whole Concept Addressed: This movie must have been put out by some feminist organization trying to promote women in the military into more combat positions. Personally, I don't mind women in the military, but I am against women directly in combat. It's nasty business and no woman should be slinging a gun, going toe and fist; knife in hand on a combat field only to get captured, raped, and tortured by the enemy. What woman in her right mind would want to do this anyway? As for the plot; it was so glamorized by Hollywood & unrealistic, I laughed. Real SEAL CRT Training has little resemblance to the way it is portrayed in this movie. However, the movie keeps you entertained, esp with HOTTIE, Demi Moore. I would say it is worth seeing. A Better alternative to this movie: Act of Valor is about real Navy SEALS in action. Now that is a good movie!

    "G.I. Jane" is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS, the most elite and toughest training. Now, O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and co-written by the creator of the "Chronicles of Riddick" series, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like "Pitch Black" that much, so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it. Demi Moore plays Lieutenant O'Neill, a tough, no-nonsense girl who just wants to get in on the action. Out of all the roles I've seen Demi Moore in, this is my favourite one yet. She's strong-willed, determined, and as the film goes on, she becomes a giant badass. If there was ever a woman's version of "The Expendables", Demi Moore would definitely be in it. She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head, forms abs and gets totally ripped, she is still incredibly hot. Viggo Mortensen plays John, the Master Chief. No, not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen, you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal, mean, and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all, but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword. The atmosphere in this movie is awesome. You're watching all these guys and O'Neill go through boot camp and you're just sitting there going "Yeah, I couldn't do that. That's just gross". Like there's one part where they have five minutes to eat dinner and do they get fresh food? No. They get the scraps from their lunch. So their eating like half eaten corn and weird goop that been sitting there for half a day. I have to be honest, I wouldn't survive 1 day at that place. The last 20 minutes are my least favourite part of the film. It's kind of like "Full Metal Jacket" in the way that once they leave bootcamp, the movie goes downhill. But unlike "Full Metal Jacket", the movie only goes downhill a bit. It was kind of just an excuse to make stuff blow up and have a gunfight but I'm not complaining. Got to say, Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool. Overall, I highly enjoyed "G.I. Jane". I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass, and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on Blu-Ray.

    The first thing that I heard about this movie was that the US Navy was opposed to making it and was very resistant to allowing Scott to use any of their facilities. I don't know what happened in the end but they seemed to be using some pretty hi-tech weaponry. One just doesn't walk down to a corner store and buy an Apache, though I thought the Apache was being used very ineffectively in the situation. Basically the Navy Seals were being pursued by a Lybian border patrol and they were on foot, so the Apache was firing missiles. I would have used the chain gun because it is much more effective against infantry than missiles, missiles are for tanks and other vehicles. G.I. Jane is a protest movie and it is about women in the military in front line jobs. The Navy Seals are said to be the best of the front line troops and thus we focus on this. The movie is much more political and deals a lot with the political ramifications of what is going on. The biggest protest here is that nobody wants to bring women home in body bags. What the women say is that they can do anything that a man can do, so if a man can be a front line soldier, then a woman should be as well. Starship Troopers actually has women as front line soldiers. We see the main character wanting to be treated like all the other men, but at first she is given help because they feel that she needs it. What she doesn't want is to be treated any differently. The is opposition to what she is doing but it doesn't come out as strong as it did in the previews. In the previews we are led to believe that everywhere she goes she faces opposition, but this is not true. People do try to persuade her from doing it, but she is stubborn and continues. It is the political side of the movie that draws the criticism. The politicians say that they don't want women coming home in body bags. The whole idea is about change and people don't want to do it. Feminisim is a very strong force in today's society and now we are moving further into what originally were male only jobs. Today we see women weightlifters and labourers, but we still don't see women soldiers. In Australia we have women on the naval ships but not in infantry. Now, in this movie, we see the beginnings of a protest against this. The movie itself was a little confusing at times because the characters seem to mumble and it was hard to concentrate with Louisa and Melissa doing their usual girly things behind me, but that was not Ridley Scott's fault. His dark, wet style is very evident here, though it is quite different to Burton's style. Scott focuses more on this protest, and his darkness is much more realistic. Scott seems to keep the movie dark as a symbol of this world where women are not free to do what they like. Scott also seems to like rain because it is raining a lot in this movie. This seems to symbolise the struggle that the soldiers are going through in the training. The training is very hard, and Scott reminds us of this constantly. They eat from bins and go through training to handle torture and capture. They are beaten up, drowned, and pushed to the limit. They say that there is a 60% dropout rate, and most of them want Jane to do it, but she doesn't. She makes it through a large part of the course only to become a political embarrassment.

    Lovely for the game between dreams of childhood and the facts of old age. Poetry in skin of nostalgic nuances. Comedy and emotional travel, adventures with Jules Verne taste and bridges between visions of a female buck private and an old man.The empty heard of dream and forms of escape. Mixture of feelings, colors and ingenuity. And delicate form to tell a special story, no different of many others but full of lights of life sense.A movie for lost ages. Or guide for teenagers. Picture of cocoon steps and discover of basic parts of happiness. Map of way of life and scene of intre ballistic missiles fly. A snail and its wings. And the beauty of truth behind any appearance. The rest - silence. Joy of an experience .

    This movie is a story that shows the grimy an and gritty parts in war with Demi Moore who is a skilled worker in politics and is trying to help a charismatic and charming soldier. This movie is about what happens in the background when it comes to war. The movie has topnotch actors and they all do a fantastic job but what really makes this movie shine is the dialogue. It's just well written and sharp. A movie by Scott can be a hit or a miss and this one is a hit. It's well directed, well written and acting is topnotch. And watching the progress and direction of the protagonist's ideology is engrossing while he is helping run a campaign. Anyways the dialogue made the movie intriguing and entertaining to just watch and listen to people talk in this. There is other movies that has a similar premise as this with the campaign for presidency and everything but this one really does show the dirty side of politics. Although some parts may seem a bit far-fetched than others. I liked the character development in this and how, you don't know unless your hit a wall or put yourself in others shoes. I would personally watch this movie again later on in the future.

    I finally got around to seeing GI Jane. Quite a good movie - the brutality of the training bits really puts into context what women might face in combat and the "real", not theoretical brutality they face. Unfortunately, an otherwise excellent movie loses out due to a tacked-on and militarily nonsensical battle scene which occupies the last 25 minutes. The movie should have ended after Demi gave the Senator an ultimatum and she is seen, in the distance, rejoining her unit in training. By that point, all of the major hurdles and challenges will have been overcome, and we would know that the future would be there as she was to make it. It would have been a fitting ending. The dumb battle scene in the end was just awful on many levels.

    "I am wrong." Henry said. Henry and Kristl were sitting in their garage turned Cinema. The garage was a workshop with large windows and three sliding doors that was part of a petrol station. Henry and Kristl could rent it for an agreeable price, because the ground was polluted by oil and other fluids associated with cars that had spilled for decades onto the floor and fouled the soil underneath. "We could make it into a public restroom." Henry had said. "We were going to make it into a private cinema?" Kristl answered. "We could make some money on the side to cover our expenses." Henry said. "And who is going to clean this restroom?" Kristl's gaze made Henry think of a snake about to strike. "We could make it automatic, perhaps. "Henry sweat-ed a bit and felt like he had just discovered he was walking in a minefield. "A Henry o'matic." Kristl said with a flat voice.. "Uhmm." "Just wrong. Plain wrong. " Henry continued, "That is why I never get any girl friends." "But I am your friend?" Kristl said. "Yes, but I don't mean a friend friend, but a girl friend friend." "Ah." "A man like me would do something like this." Henry produced out of nowhere a small white dish on which was placed a chocolate &eacute;clair with dark chocolate of such fine color that it made Kristl's mouth water. Next to it was a fine silver spoon, that shone green in the light of the exit sign. Kristl was staring transfixed at the chocolate &eacute;clair. "You see.. I would have the notion that you give this to someone you like and that she, the she being you in this case, would like me for it. Just to be nice." "Who do you want to have killed for that?" Kristl smiled. "I don't want anything for it, you just get it for free because you are my friend. Not a girl friend kinda friend, but a friend friend." "Gracias." Kristl took hold of the dish with a slightly trembling hand. "But I am silly really, because women want to be tough cookies that like to be trounced so you get respect from them and you get trounced by them so they respect you.. And then the greatest praise you can get from them is: 'suck my dick'" Kristl was eyeing her &eacute;clair in a way that clearly showed she had not yet made up her mind to swallow it whole or eat it in small bits. She decided on the latter. "I am overjoyed that US finest troops are in reality dumb gung ho halfwits that are trained to a sharp killer edge by humiliation and torture. Guess that makes a good soldier." "suck my dick?" Henry said, "What does that mean?" "Well, she wants to be man really, so that guy can suck hers or his. I am getting a bit confused." "I was a bit embarrassed when that one guy walks up to her and stammers 'yu are okaj' to her like he was lurch from the Addams Family. I thought well, Seals, aren't they the finest of our men? Somehow Lurch doesn't quite fit in with that picture." "It actually makes me happy. Would be scary to think they were serious experienced intelligent men with a professional attitude. They could be effective and deadly..brr. " Kristl said and continued, "I was a bit annoyed when it was suggested it was bad that she might be a lesbian. Oh my god she is a lesbian! We have to put up with blacks, women, gays and now with lesbian So what does that say: you can be a woman in the army but not when you are a lesbian?" "Imagine being a black lesbian" Henry laughed. "But how do you feel about the whole movie?" "I have to say it was an exceptionally run-of-the-mill movie. I didn't like any of the people in it. They were an amalgam of faces in dark surroundings. Then the movie used all the clich&eacute;s. The politicians who can't be trusted and sell you out if it suits their fancy. The lone hero Jane who, having no experience whatsoever in politics, manipulates that woman, with decades of experience in politics. The cigar crunching commander with the I-don't-like-politics attitude. The drill sergeant who is tough on her but finally grudgingly starts to respect her. The boys who first look down on her and then become her buddies." "Yes, but I think that was all you could do with the story." Henry nodded. "G. I. Jane has proved that us women can be beaten and humiliated as any other man in the army. And isn't this sad? How great is it that such fine intelligent people are wasting their lives on something so utterly needless as the act of waging war? There are people who can contribute something of value to the progress of humanity, but the only thing they learn is 'how to blow things up'. The movie is a hallmark of utter waste: now we women can be as useless as any men because we have equal access to all the branches of the army." "Hurrah for equality." Henry said. "Any more of those &eacute;clairs?" Kristl smiled. "A whole box of them." Henry winked as he showed her the box, "Come and get them." After chasing Henry for five minutes He gave in and handed her the box. "All for equality." Henry said. "Jummy." Said Kristl.

    This one was bound to raise many Red Flags in a lot of Quarters. It is a Movie with a target on its back daring you to shoot. Taking a "Women in Combat" controversy, although it seems less so Today", and shoving it in your Face like a Drill Sergeant daring you to speak out. This Movie is a Noble effort, but it may have aimed a bit too high. The concept here, (just give us an equal chance to be equal) would have been more realistic if Ridley Scott and Writer David Twohy had not chosen the prestigious Navy Seals with its famous dropout rate, and the Elite of the Elite status, as a Battleground for Politics. That takes it to a level of arguable absurdity. It would have been more believable and may have quieted the Nay-Sayers somewhat, if it was simply the U.S. Marines or any other simply difficult and grueling group of the Military's Might. But given that Melodramatic Fiction (see below), this can be inspirational and Entertaining in a Hollywood Underdog Story that it does so well. It is one of Demi Moore's best efforts. THIS IS FROM NAVY.COM......by law there are two communities that women are not allowed to join: the Navy SEAL and Navy SWCC communities.

    This movie is proof that in Hollywood all things are possible. I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays "Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill" who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it "Senator Lillian DeHaven" also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all "gender norms" as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor "Master Chief John James Urgayle" (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one.

I really enjoyed this film despite some of its problems at suspending disbelief. For example, when the master chief is looking at the exercise where the recruits are in the rain, climbing forward on their bellies under barbed wire, he's "seeing" the action that wouldn't be possible through a scope or binoculars.

    Lovely for the game between dreams of childhood and the facts of old age. Poetry in skin of nostalgic nuances. Comedy and emotional travel, adventures with Jules Verne taste and bridges between visions of a female buck private and an old man.The empty heard of dream and forms of escape. Mixture of feelings, colors and ingenuity. And delicate form to tell a special story, no different of many others but full of lights of life sense.A movie for lost ages. Or guide for teenagers. Picture of cocoon steps and discover of basic parts of happiness. Map of way of life and scene of intre ballistic missiles fly. A snail and its wings. And the beauty of truth behind any appearance. The rest - silence. Joy of an experience .

    This movie is a story that shows the grimy an and gritty parts in war with Demi Moore who is a skilled worker in politics and is trying to help a charismatic and charming soldier. This movie is about what happens in the background when it comes to war. The movie has topnotch actors and they all do a fantastic job but what really makes this movie shine is the dialogue. It's just well written and sharp. A movie by Scott can be a hit or a miss and this one is a hit. It's well directed, well written and acting is topnotch. And watching the progress and direction of the protagonist's ideology is engrossing while he is helping run a campaign. Anyways the dialogue made the movie intriguing and entertaining to just watch and listen to people talk in this. There is other movies that has a similar premise as this with the campaign for presidency and everything but this one really does show the dirty side of politics. Although some parts may seem a bit far-fetched than others. I liked the character development in this and how, you don't know unless your hit a wall or put yourself in others shoes. I would personally watch this movie again later on in the future.
