    I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying. The first film since Dimension (Disney) took over the franchise. The two movies that followed were considerably better H20 and Resurrection were better movies than this.This movie plays with the idea that Michael Myers can be controlled is ludicrous. It plays off the storyline from the last film that the curse came from something astrological, a constellation called thorn if memory serves. This movie lacks real scares. It replaces them with violent shocks. Sadly this would be Donald Pleasance's last appearance as Dr.Loomis.

    Part VI takes place six years after the fifth film ends, with a young woman(said to be Jamie Lloyd, but played by a different actress) escaping the mysterious cult that held her prisoner, along with her baby, with Michael Myers once again in murderous, relentless pursuit. She leaves the baby behind in a bus depot for safety, only to be brutally dispatched by Michael... However, a now grown Tommy Doyle(one of the kids that Laurie Strode babysat from the original) tracks down Doctor Loomis(played for the last time by a sickly Donald Pleasance) to take the baby themselves, leading to a showdown where many shocking revelations will be uncovered... Though well intended by writer Daniel Farrands as a satisfying finale to the series, this entry proved to be an unmitigated disaster, sabotaged by atrocious & shameful rewriting, editing and directing, rendering the film a crass, incoherent mess. Sad to say, Donald Pleasance's last film(he died before it was released).

    And so we arrive at the sixth instalment, by which time all ambiguity about Michael Myers has withered away thanks to this series' habit of pulling relatives out of nowhere and mucking about with its continuity. This one introduces the potty idea that Myers is controlled by runes that appear as a star constellation every Halloween and a cult is using them to... erm... well, this film is far from coherent and I kind of lost track of the plot after a while. Apparently there's a producer's cut that makes a lot more sense, but I haven't seen it so let's work with what we've got. In the plus column, Donald Pleasence, in his final film role (he deserved better), produces some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given, and Marianne Hagan is credible as a single mother and the only real character in the middle of all the monotonous deaths. And Paul Rudd has his moments in an early role. That's it for the positive aspects. There are so many things this film bungles, so many ways in which it loses credibility that after half an hour I gave up on it and sighed a lot. Mangling John Carpenter's sinister theme music by turning it into an action cue isn't a good start, but the film is also rife with ineffective false scares and embarrasses itself by referencing 'Rear Window'. Myers again moves around with inhuman speed, but that's the least of the problems when it comes to his actions. How does he string that DJ up in a tree? Why does he put one victim's bloodied clothes in a washing machine? Why does he take the time to hide her body in a tree, and how does he time it so she dangles down at exactly the right time? More questions: why does Hagan's father chop down a For Sale sign with an axe rather than pull it out of the ground? Why does a long, smooth corridor wall have a spike sticking out of it at just the right height to, say, impale a skull? Why does a nurse call security when faced with a desperate man claiming his baby needs medical attention? Why can't Kim Darby navigate through a garden full of obstacles no more dangerous than clothes on a washing line? How does Pleasence recognise the rune, which, if I'm not mistaken, was only previously seen at the end of the abysmal 'Halloween 5'? Does electrocution really make your head explode? And so on and so on and so on. 'Halloween III' remains the best (or should that be least worst) follow up if only because it gave us a break from the Michael Myers stuff, but this is by default the best of the sequels that feature him.

    After the major disappointment of the fifth one, 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' delivers the goods for fans as we find out the motivation behind Michael's killing spree. As you know, 'Halloween 5' ended with Jamie in the police station after some man in black killed all the cops. Well for six years, Jamie has been held against her will by that man and several of his twisted staff. She was also impregnated and now has a newborn baby. Sadly Michael murders, Jamie but could not find what he was really after - her baby boy. Tommy Doyle (the little boy from the first film!) is all grown up now, and still obsessed with what took place that night in 1978. He finds the baby where Jamie hid it from Michael, and spends the film with Kara Strode, her young son Danny and Dr. Loomis trying to keep it safe from the masked killer. I like 'Halloween 6' because it puts a real effort into taking us back to the original. We see Tommy Doyle, the little boy whom Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysat in 1978. We also get introduced to a part of the Strode family, the Strode's of course were the family that adopted Laurie from the Myers'. And the Myers house ACTUALLY resembles the original house, which of course it didn't in the fifth film. George Wilbur makes his return as Michael Myers. He played Michael in 'Halloween 4' and did a great job then, so it was glad to have him back after the underwhelming job Don Shanks did as the killer in part 5. The acting was good all around, in particular from the Strode family characters (Marianne Hagan, Kim Darby and Bradford English). And Donald Pleasence puts in a marvellous performance to end his brilliant career. The real story of this sixth instalment is that we find out WHY Michael has been killing for all of these years. We first saw the Thorn symbol in 'Halloween 5'. Well apparently, Michael was programmed as a child (using this Pagan/Magical Thorn symbol) to kill his family! They give a large explanation on this, but basically when the Thorn symbol appears in the stars on Halloween night each year, it prompts Michael to murder. It explains the method behind Michael's madness. It's a bit far fetched of course, but I liked the efforts to bring a refreshing twist to the story. And it ties all the loose ends we were left with in 'Halloween 5'. Although I liked the idea of Thorn because it brought life to the series, I also view it as a flaw. I think it was far more dark not knowing what was behind Michael's wanting to kill his family. It made him more creepy and insane. Knowing that he was controlled to do what he did for years, only tarnishes his villainous reputation and makes viewers almost sympathize. The gore was good in this, a step up from 'Halloween 5'. And we get some good eerie atmospheric scenes within the streets of Haddonfield. It brings back some genuine scares to the series. Check it out! 6/10

    Michael Myers (hulking George Wilbur) returns once more to Haddonfield, Illinois to resume his killing spree. It's up to troubled Tommy Doyle (well played by Paul Rudd) and Dr. Loomis (a game, but wasted Donald Pleasence, who's given precious little screen time) to stop Myers. Director Joe Chappelle not only crucially fails to develop any suspense or spooky atmosphere, but also goes way overboard with loads of ugly violence and cheap jump-out-at-you fake scares. Worse yet, the wrongheaded script by Daniel Farrands makes a grievous blunder by providing some kind of ridiculous Druid cult back story for Myers, thus completely undermining Myers' status as the embodiment of pure evil as established in the previous films in the series. Moreover, this picture further suffers from a foul mean-spirited tone that hangs heavy over everything like a putrid fog; placing a newborn baby in considerable jeopardy rates as an especially gross and offensive error on the part of the filmmakers. The plodding pace, clumsy use of flash cutting, and a blaring guitar riff during the murders don't help matters any. Ditto the brutal killing of the Jamie Lloyd character and Loomis' lame send-off. On the plus side, Marianne Hagan contributes an appealing turn as the sympathetic Kara Strode, Mitchell Ryan makes for a nice villain as the sinister Dr. Terence Wynn, and the fetching Mariah O'Brien as the brash Beth bares her sweet perky breasts prior to meeting a harsh untimely end. A real disappointment.

    Here's why. Through 4 movies leading up to Curse of Michael Myers, we see him get stabbed, shot, run over, set on fire, blown up, etc. He always comes back stronger than ever though! This film explains that Michael was given special powers by the Cult of Thorn on Halloween night when he was a boy (the opening scene in the original Halloween). Aside from that, it's just another chance to see Michael Myers in action. Pretty weak reasons, I know, but if you love the Halloween franchise, you can't not see this movie...if for anything for the last appearance of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). This film could have been better if it worked on the plot a little better, however. Of course Halloween, like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street was just about squeezing out the dollars...much like the modern Saw films or Paranormal Activity; the idea is to do as many sequels as possible before the franchise completely dries up. Still, this film at least has some connection to the original film unlike Halloween Resurrection or Halloween III. Not that I don't like Halloween III...

    After watching the 5 Halloween films, I heard that there was another film in the franchise and watched it to see if it would satisfy me. Then, I became a bit disappointed, but I don't think this film is as bad as the critics suggested that it was. It's flaws in it's own ways, but it does have some redeeming aspects that save this from getting a lower rating. While some of the actors fell flat, it's great to see Donald Pleasance again as Dr. Loomis (it's sad that he died since this was his last film role) and the new actors including Paul Rudd did fine with their roles. Michael Myers is spooky and scary once again and his make-up never fails to amuse me. The death scenes are both gory and very satisfying especially the part where Jamie Lloyd from Halloweens 4 & 5 died which gave me some chills here and there. The scenery is breathtaking and the directing is above-average. The music is pretty good captures the same suspenseful tone of the previous films very well along with some haunting moments. Now for the flaws. The story is pretty predictable. I liked the concept about the Thorn which was the reason why Michael Myers killed his sister in the original and is well explained, but it suffers from too many plot holes like one scene for example, how the heck did Michael move from one place to another so fast? The script is pretty messy with an abrupt ending that leaves sometime to be desired and the dialog is unbelievably terrible with some unfunny moments. The main protagonists are interesting enough, but most of the characters are flat and are only used at victims to Michael Myers. Even the pacing is a bit sluggish. Overall, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers would've been a much better sequel, but it's not as bad as some say it is. Recommended to those who haven't seen it, but for others, I'd stick to the previous films.

    "Halloween 5" (1989) was a rushed project with a ridiculous story and a stupid ending. It pretty much killed the franchise and it took six years before a new sequel was released. The rights once owned by Transcas Films were bought by Miramax/Dimension (a division of Buena Vista/Disney). The one brave thing this sequel has is that it's trying to explain the mess "Halloween 5" was. But unfortunately, the new story is potentially even dumber than Part 5. According to the movie, it's six years later. Jamie is being held by a cult and gives birth. How can than be, she's what, 14 years old ? We get a new actress, J.C. Brandy (the producers didn't want to pay Danielle Harris the 5000 euro for her return) who looks like she's almost 30 years old. She flees with her newborn baby (according to the producer's cut, Michael is the father (..)) Eitherway, the introduction of the baby is dumb. Michael Myers is not skilled or cunning in this one. For example, he's not able to figure out that Jamie hid her baby in the women's room of a bus station. Even though he's been there chasing her, and after he kills her, he even finds a paper roll of that same restroom in her car. It's a shame Jamie was killed off so quick in the Theatrical Cut, it was as dumb as killing off Rachel right at the beginning of Part 5. Than we're introduced to Tommy Doyle. One of the kids who Laurie Strode babysat in the original "Halloween". He's obsessed with Michael and finds the baby in the bathroom the next morning. Apparently, it's not a popular bathroom since no one has been there that entire time for about 12 hours. Must be because of the massive blood trail Jamie left the night before that no one bothered to clean up. There's also a new family in the old Myers house. They are relatives of the Strode family who adopted Laurie after Michael killed her sister in the original. Besides the father, the family doesn't know that they live in the Myers house. Rather silly when you think about it. Again, it's not the original house they used in the classic, but it's not as silly as the "Old Myers house" in Part 5. The story makes no sense at all, trying to explain why Michael kills. The evil cult thing is awful. The reveal of the mysterious man in black is unbelievable. Remember, he's the one who took out an entire police station like the Terminator at the end of Part 5. Main reason for the messy story is that half the movie was re-shot and re-edited. The Producer's Cut has a way better story but it's still not a very good movie. It has much more scenes with Donald Pleasance and the music is way better. This Theatrical Cut suffers from a lame and incoherent story, very bad editing, unnecessary gore and an unsatisfying ending. Michael Myers is once again played by stuntman George P. Wilbur (he was also Myers in Halloween 4) but here his moves and posture are just not right. He looks more like Jason Voorhees in this one. The cast is not even that bad compared to Part 5. Paul Stephen Rudd (he also starred in "Clueless" that year) plays his part very well, just as Marianne Hagan. Mitchel P. Ryan is underused since he's a great actor and has more potential (Lethal Weapon).It's sad to see that Donald Pleasence's role has almost been reduced to a cameo. He's the only one who held up the "Halloween" franchise. Too bad director Chapelle cut out a lot of his scenes for the the Theatrical Cut. I'v always been a big fan of "Halloween" and horror films in general. The first one remains the best. "Halloween II" (1981) was a very well made sequel that was almost as good as the original. After that, my most favorite "Halloween" is "H20": It was fresh, revived the franchise, had Jamie Lee Curtis and a scary Michael again and went back to the roots of this franchise. "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers" (1988) was a solid entry with great performances by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris. Since that one was a success, a sequel had to be in theaters the next year to compete with Jason and Freddy. Unfortunately, 1989 turned out to be a very bad year for horror: "Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan", "Nightmare 5: The Dream Child" and "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers" had 2 things in common: they all did very poorly at the box office and were among the worst in their franchises. "Halloween 5" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful "Halloween: H20" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.

    The sixth entry in the Halloween franchise picks up some years after the conclusion of Halloween 5. Jamie Lloyd is now a full grown adult, and she's just given birth. Unfortunately for her, Jamie has been kept in the basement of Smith's Grove Sanitarium (the facility that has housed Michael during his stints in and out of custody) by the likes of an underground Druid cult that seeks to somehow restore the once great night of Halloween to its former glory. What that former glory entails is anyone's guess; some gibberish about mayhem, bonfires and star alignments is thrown into the mix, but said references are every bit as vague as they sound. The question you likely have is this: How does Michael Myers fit into all this ridiculousness? Well, as the previous movies have indicated, he's somehow connected to the Druid sacrificial rite, but a lucid explanation of the exact role he plays isyet againconspicuously absent. I suppose it doesn't really matter, though; he's still alive, still angry, and still killing people. Once again he's after the last living remnant of the Myers bloodline, the newborn baby of his aforementioned niece. Oddly enough, Tommy Doyleone of the children from the original Halloween that Laurie babysat "the night he came home"has become obsessed with the persistent rumors about Michael and has rented a room across the street from the Myers house to keep tabs on its residents, one of whom is a kid with the same penchant for murder that Michael himself demonstrated so many years ago. Loomis is back, too. He is, of course, not surprised in the least when Michael reappears in Haddonfield, and the usual hijinks ensue (namely, people don't believe the famed serial killer is still alive, make the mistake of writing him off, and end up getting axed in oh-so-creative ways). The atmosphere generated in the movie is admirable, and this is one of Michael's more menacing outings. Still, one can't help but feel disappointed by the lack of story development, and the movie's conclusion feels much too abrupt. This almost certainly is a direct result of director Joe Chappelle's apparent distaste for Pleasence. According to the Internet Movie Database, Chappelle found many of Pleasence's scenes "boring," and thus engaged in heavy editing in an effort to trim down his presence in the movie. The result is a disjointed affair that's not nearly as effective as it could have been. In short, The Curse of Michael Myers is a convoluted mess that only pretends to answer some of the longstanding questions surrounding the Halloween mythology. The movie has its moments, and the presence of Paul Rudd as the now adult Doyle adds some memorability to the cast of characters.

    Trying to move on with her life, a woman moves back to her hometown unaware of her connection to the Michael Myers bloodline and faces his wrath when he escapes from a sanitarium and resumes his blood-soaked rampage in town. This one here manages to be one of the more enjoyable entries in the series and might very well better than the original. One of the strongest elements for this one derives numerous positive attributes from is the fact that, as a straight Slasher movie, this delivers impeccably. These should feature an imposing killer, which this one has in spades. The creepy mask has never looked better, the more hulking shape to his body is more credible for doling out the more strenuous physical action and the walk is genuinely creepy, a complete stalk and slash attitude, coming relentlessly with no remorse offered to his victims. As well, there's plenty to love about the graphic kills and deaths here, which is one of the best angles here with just a ton of greatness provided with a wide variety of kills delivered with a generous dose of methods, from stabbing to impaling to thrusting into the body and bare-handed, among others, to provide a spectacular array of bloody deaths dished out rather nicely. As well, the fact that this is pretty creepy at times is important as it adds an extra layer to the film with a large quantity of quality suspenseful scenes, from the opening underground escape and bus station stalking to the sneak-attack on the babysitter and the rampage through the hospital, it provides some really chilling moments that work well and give this an outstanding pace. While the story might be give-or-take depending on how you feel it connects to the rest of the series, it's really the only thing wrong here as this is an otherwise outstanding effort. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a brief sex scene.

We also get introduced to a part of the Strode family, the Strode's of course were the family that adopted Laurie from the Myers'. And the Myers house ACTUALLY resembles the original house, which of course it didn't in the fifth film. George Wilbur makes his return as Michael Myers. He played Michael in 'Halloween 4' and did a great job then, so it was glad to have him back after the underwhelming job Don Shanks did as the killer in part 5. The acting was good all around, in particular from the Strode family characters (Marianne Hagan, Kim Darby and Bradford English). And Donald Pleasence puts in a marvellous performance to end his brilliant career. The real story of this sixth instalment is that we find out WHY Michael has been killing for all of these years. We first saw the Thorn symbol in 'Halloween 5'. Well apparently, Michael was programmed as a child (using this Pagan/Magical Thorn symbol) to kill his family! They give a large explanation on this, but basically when the Thorn symbol appears in the stars on Halloween night each year, it prompts Michael to murder. It explains the method behind Michael's madness. It's a bit far fetched of course, but I liked the efforts to bring a refreshing twist to the story. And it ties all the loose ends we were left with in 'Halloween 5'. Although I liked the idea of Thorn because it brought life to the series, I also view it as a flaw. I think it was far more dark not knowing what was behind Michael's wanting to kill his family. It made him more creepy and insane. Knowing that he was controlled to do what he did for years, only tarnishes his villainous reputation and makes viewers almost sympathize. The gore was good in this, a step up from 'Halloween 5'. And we get some good eerie atmospheric scenes within the streets of Haddonfield. It brings back some genuine scares to the series. Check it out! 6/10

    Michael Myers (hulking George Wilbur) returns once more to Haddonfield, Illinois to resume his killing spree. It's up to troubled Tommy Doyle (well played by Paul Rudd) and Dr. Loomis (a game, but wasted Donald Pleasence, who's given precious little screen time) to stop Myers. Director Joe Chappelle not only crucially fails to develop any suspense or spooky atmosphere, but also goes way overboard with loads of ugly violence and cheap jump-out-at-you fake scares. Worse yet, the wrongheaded script by Daniel Farrands makes a grievous blunder by providing some kind of ridiculous Druid cult back story for Myers, thus completely undermining Myers' status as the embodiment of pure evil as established in the previous films in the series. Moreover, this picture further suffers from a foul mean-spirited tone that hangs heavy over everything like a putrid fog; placing a newborn baby in considerable jeopardy rates as an especially gross and offensive error on the part of the filmmakers. The plodding pace, clumsy use of flash cutting, and a blaring guitar riff during the murders don't help matters any. Ditto the brutal killing of the Jamie Lloyd character and Loomis' lame send-off. On the plus side, Marianne Hagan contributes an appealing turn as the sympathetic Kara Strode, Mitchell Ryan makes for a nice villain as the sinister Dr. Terence Wynn, and the fetching Mariah O'Brien as the brash Beth bares her sweet perky breasts prior to meeting a harsh untimely end. A real disappointment.

    Here's why. Through 4 movies leading up to Curse of Michael Myers, we see him get stabbed, shot, run over, set on fire, blown up, etc. He always comes back stronger than ever though! This film explains that Michael was given special powers by the Cult of Thorn on Halloween night when he was a boy (the opening scene in the original Halloween). Aside from that, it's just another chance to see Michael Myers in action. Pretty weak reasons, I know, but if you love the Halloween franchise, you can't not see this movie...if for anything for the last appearance of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). This film could have been better if it worked on the plot a little better, however. Of course Halloween, like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street was just about squeezing out the dollars...much like the modern Saw films or Paranormal Activity; the idea is to do as many sequels as possible before the franchise completely dries up. Still, this film at least has some connection to the original film unlike Halloween Resurrection or Halloween III. Not that I don't like Halloween III...

    After watching the 5 Halloween films, I heard that there was another film in the franchise and watched it to see if it would satisfy me. Then, I became a bit disappointed, but I don't think this film is as bad as the critics suggested that it was. It's flaws in it's own ways, but it does have some redeeming aspects that save this from getting a lower rating. While some of the actors fell flat, it's great to see Donald Pleasance again as Dr. Loomis (it's sad that he died since this was his last film role) and the new actors including Paul Rudd did fine with their roles. Michael Myers is spooky and scary once again and his make-up never fails to amuse me. The death scenes are both gory and very satisfying especially the part where Jamie Lloyd from Halloweens 4 & 5 died which gave me some chills here and there. The scenery is breathtaking and the directing is above-average. The music is pretty good captures the same suspenseful tone of the previous films very well along with some haunting moments. Now for the flaws. The story is pretty predictable. I liked the concept about the Thorn which was the reason why Michael Myers killed his sister in the original and is well explained, but it suffers from too many plot holes like one scene for example, how the heck did Michael move from one place to another so fast? The script is pretty messy with an abrupt ending that leaves sometime to be desired and the dialog is unbelievably terrible with some unfunny moments. The main protagonists are interesting enough, but most of the characters are flat and are only used at victims to Michael Myers. Even the pacing is a bit sluggish. Overall, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers would've been a much better sequel, but it's not as bad as some say it is. Recommended to those who haven't seen it, but for others, I'd stick to the previous films.

    "Halloween 5" (1989) was a rushed project with a ridiculous story and a stupid ending. It pretty much killed the franchise and it took six years before a new sequel was released. The rights once owned by Transcas Films were bought by Miramax/Dimension (a division of Buena Vista/Disney). The one brave thing this sequel has is that it's trying to explain the mess "Halloween 5" was. But unfortunately, the new story is potentially even dumber than Part 5. According to the movie, it's six years later. Jamie is being held by a cult and gives birth. How can than be, she's what, 14 years old ? We get a new actress, J.C. Brandy (the producers didn't want to pay Danielle Harris the 5000 euro for her return) who looks like she's almost 30 years old. She flees with her newborn baby (according to the producer's cut, Michael is the father (..)) Eitherway, the introduction of the baby is dumb. Michael Myers is not skilled or cunning in this one. For example, he's not able to figure out that Jamie hid her baby in the women's room of a bus station. Even though he's been there chasing her, and after he kills her, he even finds a paper roll of that same restroom in her car. It's a shame Jamie was killed off so quick in the Theatrical Cut, it was as dumb as killing off Rachel right at the beginning of Part 5. Than we're introduced to Tommy Doyle. One of the kids who Laurie Strode babysat in the original "Halloween". He's obsessed with Michael and finds the baby in the bathroom the next morning. Apparently, it's not a popular bathroom since no one has been there that entire time for about 12 hours. Must be because of the massive blood trail Jamie left the night before that no one bothered to clean up. There's also a new family in the old Myers house. They are relatives of the Strode family who adopted Laurie after Michael killed her sister in the original. Besides the father, the family doesn't know that they live in the Myers house. Rather silly when you think about it. Again, it's not the original house they used in the classic, but it's not as silly as the "Old Myers house" in Part 5. The story makes no sense at all, trying to explain why Michael kills. The evil cult thing is awful. The reveal of the mysterious man in black is unbelievable. Remember, he's the one who took out an entire police station like the Terminator at the end of Part 5. Main reason for the messy story is that half the movie was re-shot and re-edited. The Producer's Cut has a way better story but it's still not a very good movie. It has much more scenes with Donald Pleasance and the music is way better. This Theatrical Cut suffers from a lame and incoherent story, very bad editing, unnecessary gore and an unsatisfying ending. Michael Myers is once again played by stuntman George P. Wilbur (he was also Myers in Halloween 4) but here his moves and posture are just not right. He looks more like Jason Voorhees in this one. The cast is not even that bad compared to Part 5. Paul Stephen Rudd (he also starred in "Clueless" that year) plays his part very well, just as Marianne Hagan. Mitchel P. Ryan is underused since he's a great actor and has more potential (Lethal Weapon).It's sad to see that Donald Pleasence's role has almost been reduced to a cameo. He's the only one who held up the "Halloween" franchise. Too bad director Chapelle cut out a lot of his scenes for the the Theatrical Cut. I'v always been a big fan of "Halloween" and horror films in general. The first one remains the best. "Halloween II" (1981) was a very well made sequel that was almost as good as the original. After that, my most favorite "Halloween" is "H20": It was fresh, revived the franchise, had Jamie Lee Curtis and a scary Michael again and went back to the roots of this franchise. "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers" (1988) was a solid entry with great performances by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris. Since that one was a success, a sequel had to be in theaters the next year to compete with Jason and Freddy. Unfortunately, 1989 turned out to be a very bad year for horror: "Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan", "Nightmare 5: The Dream Child" and "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers" had 2 things in common: they all did very poorly at the box office and were among the worst in their franchises. "Halloween 5" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful "Halloween: H20" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.

    The sixth entry in the Halloween franchise picks up some years after the conclusion of Halloween 5. Jamie Lloyd is now a full grown adult, and she's just given birth. Unfortunately for her, Jamie has been kept in the basement of Smith's Grove Sanitarium (the facility that has housed Michael during his stints in and out of custody) by the likes of an underground Druid cult that seeks to somehow restore the once great night of Halloween to its former glory. What that former glory entails is anyone's guess; some gibberish about mayhem, bonfires and star alignments is thrown into the mix, but said references are every bit as vague as they sound. The question you likely have is this: How does Michael Myers fit into all this ridiculousness? Well, as the previous movies have indicated, he's somehow connected to the Druid sacrificial rite, but a lucid explanation of the exact role he plays isyet againconspicuously absent. I suppose it doesn't really matter, though; he's still alive, still angry, and still killing people. Once again he's after the last living remnant of the Myers bloodline, the newborn baby of his aforementioned niece. Oddly enough, Tommy Doyleone of the children from the original Halloween that Laurie babysat "the night he came home"has become obsessed with the persistent rumors about Michael and has rented a room across the street from the Myers house to keep tabs on its residents, one of whom is a kid with the same penchant for murder that Michael himself demonstrated so many years ago. Loomis is back, too. He is, of course, not surprised in the least when Michael reappears in Haddonfield, and the usual hijinks ensue (namely, people don't believe the famed serial killer is still alive, make the mistake of writing him off, and end up getting axed in oh-so-creative ways). The atmosphere generated in the movie is admirable, and this is one of Michael's more menacing outings. Still, one can't help but feel disappointed by the lack of story development, and the movie's conclusion feels much too abrupt. This almost certainly is a direct result of director Joe Chappelle's apparent distaste for Pleasence. According to the Internet Movie Database, Chappelle found many of Pleasence's scenes "boring," and thus engaged in heavy editing in an effort to trim down his presence in the movie. The result is a disjointed affair that's not nearly as effective as it could have been. In short, The Curse of Michael Myers is a convoluted mess that only pretends to answer some of the longstanding questions surrounding the Halloween mythology. The movie has its moments, and the presence of Paul Rudd as the now adult Doyle adds some memorability to the cast of characters.

    Trying to move on with her life, a woman moves back to her hometown unaware of her connection to the Michael Myers bloodline and faces his wrath when he escapes from a sanitarium and resumes his blood-soaked rampage in town. This one here manages to be one of the more enjoyable entries in the series and might very well better than the original. One of the strongest elements for this one derives numerous positive attributes from is the fact that, as a straight Slasher movie, this delivers impeccably. These should feature an imposing killer, which this one has in spades. The creepy mask has never looked better, the more hulking shape to his body is more credible for doling out the more strenuous physical action and the walk is genuinely creepy, a complete stalk and slash attitude, coming relentlessly with no remorse offered to his victims. As well, there's plenty to love about the graphic kills and deaths here, which is one of the best angles here with just a ton of greatness provided with a wide variety of kills delivered with a generous dose of methods, from stabbing to impaling to thrusting into the body and bare-handed, among others, to provide a spectacular array of bloody deaths dished out rather nicely. As well, the fact that this is pretty creepy at times is important as it adds an extra layer to the film with a large quantity of quality suspenseful scenes, from the opening underground escape and bus station stalking to the sneak-attack on the babysitter and the rampage through the hospital, it provides some really chilling moments that work well and give this an outstanding pace. While the story might be give-or-take depending on how you feel it connects to the rest of the series, it's really the only thing wrong here as this is an otherwise outstanding effort. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a brief sex scene.

    I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying. The first film since Dimension (Disney) took over the franchise. The two movies that followed were considerably better H20 and Resurrection were better movies than this.This movie plays with the idea that Michael Myers can be controlled is ludicrous. It plays off the storyline from the last film that the curse came from something astrological, a constellation called thorn if memory serves. This movie lacks real scares. It replaces them with violent shocks. Sadly this would be Donald Pleasance's last appearance as Dr.Loomis.

    Part VI takes place six years after the fifth film ends, with a young woman(said to be Jamie Lloyd, but played by a different actress) escaping the mysterious cult that held her prisoner, along with her baby, with Michael Myers once again in murderous, relentless pursuit. She leaves the baby behind in a bus depot for safety, only to be brutally dispatched by Michael... However, a now grown Tommy Doyle(one of the kids that Laurie Strode babysat from the original) tracks down Doctor Loomis(played for the last time by a sickly Donald Pleasance) to take the baby themselves, leading to a showdown where many shocking revelations will be uncovered... Though well intended by writer Daniel Farrands as a satisfying finale to the series, this entry proved to be an unmitigated disaster, sabotaged by atrocious & shameful rewriting, editing and directing, rendering the film a crass, incoherent mess. Sad to say, Donald Pleasance's last film(he died before it was released).

    And so we arrive at the sixth instalment, by which time all ambiguity about Michael Myers has withered away thanks to this series' habit of pulling relatives out of nowhere and mucking about with its continuity. This one introduces the potty idea that Myers is controlled by runes that appear as a star constellation every Halloween and a cult is using them to... erm... well, this film is far from coherent and I kind of lost track of the plot after a while. Apparently there's a producer's cut that makes a lot more sense, but I haven't seen it so let's work with what we've got. In the plus column, Donald Pleasence, in his final film role (he deserved better), produces some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given, and Marianne Hagan is credible as a single mother and the only real character in the middle of all the monotonous deaths. And Paul Rudd has his moments in an early role. That's it for the positive aspects. There are so many things this film bungles, so many ways in which it loses credibility that after half an hour I gave up on it and sighed a lot. Mangling John Carpenter's sinister theme music by turning it into an action cue isn't a good start, but the film is also rife with ineffective false scares and embarrasses itself by referencing 'Rear Window'. Myers again moves around with inhuman speed, but that's the least of the problems when it comes to his actions. How does he string that DJ up in a tree? Why does he put one victim's bloodied clothes in a washing machine? Why does he take the time to hide her body in a tree, and how does he time it so she dangles down at exactly the right time? More questions: why does Hagan's father chop down a For Sale sign with an axe rather than pull it out of the ground? Why does a long, smooth corridor wall have a spike sticking out of it at just the right height to, say, impale a skull? Why does a nurse call security when faced with a desperate man claiming his baby needs medical attention? Why can't Kim Darby navigate through a garden full of obstacles no more dangerous than clothes on a washing line? How does Pleasence recognise the rune, which, if I'm not mistaken, was only previously seen at the end of the abysmal 'Halloween 5'? Does electrocution really make your head explode? And so on and so on and so on. 'Halloween III' remains the best (or should that be least worst) follow up if only because it gave us a break from the Michael Myers stuff, but this is by default the best of the sequels that feature him.

    After the major disappointment of the fifth one, 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' delivers the goods for fans as we find out the motivation behind Michael's killing spree. As you know, 'Halloween 5' ended with Jamie in the police station after some man in black killed all the cops. Well for six years, Jamie has been held against her will by that man and several of his twisted staff. She was also impregnated and now has a newborn baby. Sadly Michael murders, Jamie but could not find what he was really after - her baby boy. Tommy Doyle (the little boy from the first film!) is all grown up now, and still obsessed with what took place that night in 1978. He finds the baby where Jamie hid it from Michael, and spends the film with Kara Strode, her young son Danny and Dr. Loomis trying to keep it safe from the masked killer. I like 'Halloween 6' because it puts a real effort into taking us back to the original. We see Tommy Doyle, the little boy whom Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysat in 1978. We also get introduced to a part of the Strode family, the Strode's of course were the family that adopted Laurie from the Myers'. And the Myers house ACTUALLY resembles the original house, which of course it didn't in the fifth film. George Wilbur makes his return as Michael Myers. He played Michael in 'Halloween 4' and did a great job then, so it was glad to have him back after the underwhelming job Don Shanks did as the killer in part 5. The acting was good all around, in particular from the Strode family characters (Marianne Hagan, Kim Darby and Bradford English). And Donald Pleasence puts in a marvellous performance to end his brilliant career. The real story of this sixth instalment is that we find out WHY Michael has been killing for all of these years. We first saw the Thorn symbol in 'Halloween 5'. Well apparently, Michael was programmed as a child (using this Pagan/Magical Thorn symbol) to kill his family! They give a large explanation on this, but basically when the Thorn symbol appears in the stars on Halloween night each year, it prompts Michael to murder. It explains the method behind Michael's madness. It's a bit far fetched of course, but I liked the efforts to bring a refreshing twist to the story. And it ties all the loose ends we were left with in 'Halloween 5'. Although I liked the idea of Thorn because it brought life to the series, I also view it as a flaw. I think it was far more dark not knowing what was behind Michael's wanting to kill his family. It made him more creepy and insane. Knowing that he was controlled to do what he did for years, only tarnishes his villainous reputation and makes viewers almost sympathize. The gore was good in this, a step up from 'Halloween 5'.

Even though he's been there chasing her, and after he kills her, he even finds a paper roll of that same restroom in her car. It's a shame Jamie was killed off so quick in the Theatrical Cut, it was as dumb as killing off Rachel right at the beginning of Part 5. Than we're introduced to Tommy Doyle. One of the kids who Laurie Strode babysat in the original "Halloween". He's obsessed with Michael and finds the baby in the bathroom the next morning. Apparently, it's not a popular bathroom since no one has been there that entire time for about 12 hours. Must be because of the massive blood trail Jamie left the night before that no one bothered to clean up. There's also a new family in the old Myers house. They are relatives of the Strode family who adopted Laurie after Michael killed her sister in the original. Besides the father, the family doesn't know that they live in the Myers house. Rather silly when you think about it. Again, it's not the original house they used in the classic, but it's not as silly as the "Old Myers house" in Part 5. The story makes no sense at all, trying to explain why Michael kills. The evil cult thing is awful. The reveal of the mysterious man in black is unbelievable. Remember, he's the one who took out an entire police station like the Terminator at the end of Part 5. Main reason for the messy story is that half the movie was re-shot and re-edited. The Producer's Cut has a way better story but it's still not a very good movie. It has much more scenes with Donald Pleasance and the music is way better. This Theatrical Cut suffers from a lame and incoherent story, very bad editing, unnecessary gore and an unsatisfying ending. Michael Myers is once again played by stuntman George P. Wilbur (he was also Myers in Halloween 4) but here his moves and posture are just not right. He looks more like Jason Voorhees in this one. The cast is not even that bad compared to Part 5. Paul Stephen Rudd (he also starred in "Clueless" that year) plays his part very well, just as Marianne Hagan. Mitchel P. Ryan is underused since he's a great actor and has more potential (Lethal Weapon).It's sad to see that Donald Pleasence's role has almost been reduced to a cameo. He's the only one who held up the "Halloween" franchise. Too bad director Chapelle cut out a lot of his scenes for the the Theatrical Cut. I'v always been a big fan of "Halloween" and horror films in general. The first one remains the best. "Halloween II" (1981) was a very well made sequel that was almost as good as the original. After that, my most favorite "Halloween" is "H20": It was fresh, revived the franchise, had Jamie Lee Curtis and a scary Michael again and went back to the roots of this franchise. "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers" (1988) was a solid entry with great performances by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris. Since that one was a success, a sequel had to be in theaters the next year to compete with Jason and Freddy. Unfortunately, 1989 turned out to be a very bad year for horror: "Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan", "Nightmare 5: The Dream Child" and "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers" had 2 things in common: they all did very poorly at the box office and were among the worst in their franchises. "Halloween 5" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful "Halloween: H20" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.

    The sixth entry in the Halloween franchise picks up some years after the conclusion of Halloween 5. Jamie Lloyd is now a full grown adult, and she's just given birth. Unfortunately for her, Jamie has been kept in the basement of Smith's Grove Sanitarium (the facility that has housed Michael during his stints in and out of custody) by the likes of an underground Druid cult that seeks to somehow restore the once great night of Halloween to its former glory. What that former glory entails is anyone's guess; some gibberish about mayhem, bonfires and star alignments is thrown into the mix, but said references are every bit as vague as they sound. The question you likely have is this: How does Michael Myers fit into all this ridiculousness? Well, as the previous movies have indicated, he's somehow connected to the Druid sacrificial rite, but a lucid explanation of the exact role he plays isyet againconspicuously absent. I suppose it doesn't really matter, though; he's still alive, still angry, and still killing people. Once again he's after the last living remnant of the Myers bloodline, the newborn baby of his aforementioned niece. Oddly enough, Tommy Doyleone of the children from the original Halloween that Laurie babysat "the night he came home"has become obsessed with the persistent rumors about Michael and has rented a room across the street from the Myers house to keep tabs on its residents, one of whom is a kid with the same penchant for murder that Michael himself demonstrated so many years ago. Loomis is back, too. He is, of course, not surprised in the least when Michael reappears in Haddonfield, and the usual hijinks ensue (namely, people don't believe the famed serial killer is still alive, make the mistake of writing him off, and end up getting axed in oh-so-creative ways). The atmosphere generated in the movie is admirable, and this is one of Michael's more menacing outings. Still, one can't help but feel disappointed by the lack of story development, and the movie's conclusion feels much too abrupt. This almost certainly is a direct result of director Joe Chappelle's apparent distaste for Pleasence. According to the Internet Movie Database, Chappelle found many of Pleasence's scenes "boring," and thus engaged in heavy editing in an effort to trim down his presence in the movie. The result is a disjointed affair that's not nearly as effective as it could have been. In short, The Curse of Michael Myers is a convoluted mess that only pretends to answer some of the longstanding questions surrounding the Halloween mythology. The movie has its moments, and the presence of Paul Rudd as the now adult Doyle adds some memorability to the cast of characters.

    Trying to move on with her life, a woman moves back to her hometown unaware of her connection to the Michael Myers bloodline and faces his wrath when he escapes from a sanitarium and resumes his blood-soaked rampage in town. This one here manages to be one of the more enjoyable entries in the series and might very well better than the original. One of the strongest elements for this one derives numerous positive attributes from is the fact that, as a straight Slasher movie, this delivers impeccably. These should feature an imposing killer, which this one has in spades. The creepy mask has never looked better, the more hulking shape to his body is more credible for doling out the more strenuous physical action and the walk is genuinely creepy, a complete stalk and slash attitude, coming relentlessly with no remorse offered to his victims. As well, there's plenty to love about the graphic kills and deaths here, which is one of the best angles here with just a ton of greatness provided with a wide variety of kills delivered with a generous dose of methods, from stabbing to impaling to thrusting into the body and bare-handed, among others, to provide a spectacular array of bloody deaths dished out rather nicely. As well, the fact that this is pretty creepy at times is important as it adds an extra layer to the film with a large quantity of quality suspenseful scenes, from the opening underground escape and bus station stalking to the sneak-attack on the babysitter and the rampage through the hospital, it provides some really chilling moments that work well and give this an outstanding pace. While the story might be give-or-take depending on how you feel it connects to the rest of the series, it's really the only thing wrong here as this is an otherwise outstanding effort. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a brief sex scene.

    I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying. The first film since Dimension (Disney) took over the franchise. The two movies that followed were considerably better H20 and Resurrection were better movies than this.This movie plays with the idea that Michael Myers can be controlled is ludicrous. It plays off the storyline from the last film that the curse came from something astrological, a constellation called thorn if memory serves. This movie lacks real scares. It replaces them with violent shocks. Sadly this would be Donald Pleasance's last appearance as Dr.Loomis.

    Part VI takes place six years after the fifth film ends, with a young woman(said to be Jamie Lloyd, but played by a different actress) escaping the mysterious cult that held her prisoner, along with her baby, with Michael Myers once again in murderous, relentless pursuit. She leaves the baby behind in a bus depot for safety, only to be brutally dispatched by Michael... However, a now grown Tommy Doyle(one of the kids that Laurie Strode babysat from the original) tracks down Doctor Loomis(played for the last time by a sickly Donald Pleasance) to take the baby themselves, leading to a showdown where many shocking revelations will be uncovered... Though well intended by writer Daniel Farrands as a satisfying finale to the series, this entry proved to be an unmitigated disaster, sabotaged by atrocious & shameful rewriting, editing and directing, rendering the film a crass, incoherent mess. Sad to say, Donald Pleasance's last film(he died before it was released).

    And so we arrive at the sixth instalment, by which time all ambiguity about Michael Myers has withered away thanks to this series' habit of pulling relatives out of nowhere and mucking about with its continuity. This one introduces the potty idea that Myers is controlled by runes that appear as a star constellation every Halloween and a cult is using them to... erm... well, this film is far from coherent and I kind of lost track of the plot after a while. Apparently there's a producer's cut that makes a lot more sense, but I haven't seen it so let's work with what we've got. In the plus column, Donald Pleasence, in his final film role (he deserved better), produces some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given, and Marianne Hagan is credible as a single mother and the only real character in the middle of all the monotonous deaths. And Paul Rudd has his moments in an early role. That's it for the positive aspects. There are so many things this film bungles, so many ways in which it loses credibility that after half an hour I gave up on it and sighed a lot. Mangling John Carpenter's sinister theme music by turning it into an action cue isn't a good start, but the film is also rife with ineffective false scares and embarrasses itself by referencing 'Rear Window'. Myers again moves around with inhuman speed, but that's the least of the problems when it comes to his actions. How does he string that DJ up in a tree? Why does he put one victim's bloodied clothes in a washing machine? Why does he take the time to hide her body in a tree, and how does he time it so she dangles down at exactly the right time? More questions: why does Hagan's father chop down a For Sale sign with an axe rather than pull it out of the ground? Why does a long, smooth corridor wall have a spike sticking out of it at just the right height to, say, impale a skull? Why does a nurse call security when faced with a desperate man claiming his baby needs medical attention? Why can't Kim Darby navigate through a garden full of obstacles no more dangerous than clothes on a washing line? How does Pleasence recognise the rune, which, if I'm not mistaken, was only previously seen at the end of the abysmal 'Halloween 5'? Does electrocution really make your head explode? And so on and so on and so on. 'Halloween III' remains the best (or should that be least worst) follow up if only because it gave us a break from the Michael Myers stuff, but this is by default the best of the sequels that feature him.

    After the major disappointment of the fifth one, 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' delivers the goods for fans as we find out the motivation behind Michael's killing spree. As you know, 'Halloween 5' ended with Jamie in the police station after some man in black killed all the cops. Well for six years, Jamie has been held against her will by that man and several of his twisted staff. She was also impregnated and now has a newborn baby. Sadly Michael murders, Jamie but could not find what he was really after - her baby boy. Tommy Doyle (the little boy from the first film!) is all grown up now, and still obsessed with what took place that night in 1978. He finds the baby where Jamie hid it from Michael, and spends the film with Kara Strode, her young son Danny and Dr. Loomis trying to keep it safe from the masked killer. I like 'Halloween 6' because it puts a real effort into taking us back to the original. We see Tommy Doyle, the little boy whom Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysat in 1978. We also get introduced to a part of the Strode family, the Strode's of course were the family that adopted Laurie from the Myers'. And the Myers house ACTUALLY resembles the original house, which of course it didn't in the fifth film. George Wilbur makes his return as Michael Myers. He played Michael in 'Halloween 4' and did a great job then, so it was glad to have him back after the underwhelming job Don Shanks did as the killer in part 5. The acting was good all around, in particular from the Strode family characters (Marianne Hagan, Kim Darby and Bradford English). And Donald Pleasence puts in a marvellous performance to end his brilliant career. The real story of this sixth instalment is that we find out WHY Michael has been killing for all of these years. We first saw the Thorn symbol in 'Halloween 5'. Well apparently, Michael was programmed as a child (using this Pagan/Magical Thorn symbol) to kill his family! They give a large explanation on this, but basically when the Thorn symbol appears in the stars on Halloween night each year, it prompts Michael to murder. It explains the method behind Michael's madness. It's a bit far fetched of course, but I liked the efforts to bring a refreshing twist to the story. And it ties all the loose ends we were left with in 'Halloween 5'. Although I liked the idea of Thorn because it brought life to the series, I also view it as a flaw. I think it was far more dark not knowing what was behind Michael's wanting to kill his family. It made him more creepy and insane. Knowing that he was controlled to do what he did for years, only tarnishes his villainous reputation and makes viewers almost sympathize. The gore was good in this, a step up from 'Halloween 5'. And we get some good eerie atmospheric scenes within the streets of Haddonfield. It brings back some genuine scares to the series. Check it out! 6/10

    Michael Myers (hulking George Wilbur) returns once more to Haddonfield, Illinois to resume his killing spree. It's up to troubled Tommy Doyle (well played by Paul Rudd) and Dr. Loomis (a game, but wasted Donald Pleasence, who's given precious little screen time) to stop Myers. Director Joe Chappelle not only crucially fails to develop any suspense or spooky atmosphere, but also goes way overboard with loads of ugly violence and cheap jump-out-at-you fake scares. Worse yet, the wrongheaded script by Daniel Farrands makes a grievous blunder by providing some kind of ridiculous Druid cult back story for Myers, thus completely undermining Myers' status as the embodiment of pure evil as established in the previous films in the series. Moreover, this picture further suffers from a foul mean-spirited tone that hangs heavy over everything like a putrid fog; placing a newborn baby in considerable jeopardy rates as an especially gross and offensive error on the part of the filmmakers. The plodding pace, clumsy use of flash cutting, and a blaring guitar riff during the murders don't help matters any. Ditto the brutal killing of the Jamie Lloyd character and Loomis' lame send-off. On the plus side, Marianne Hagan contributes an appealing turn as the sympathetic Kara Strode, Mitchell Ryan makes for a nice villain as the sinister Dr. Terence Wynn, and the fetching Mariah O'Brien as the brash Beth bares her sweet perky breasts prior to meeting a harsh untimely end. A real disappointment.

    Here's why. Through 4 movies leading up to Curse of Michael Myers, we see him get stabbed, shot, run over, set on fire, blown up, etc. He always comes back stronger than ever though! This film explains that Michael was given special powers by the Cult of Thorn on Halloween night when he was a boy (the opening scene in the original Halloween). Aside from that, it's just another chance to see Michael Myers in action. Pretty weak reasons, I know, but if you love the Halloween franchise, you can't not see this movie...if for anything for the last appearance of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). This film could have been better if it worked on the plot a little better, however. Of course Halloween, like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street was just about squeezing out the dollars...much like the modern Saw films or Paranormal Activity; the idea is to do as many sequels as possible before the franchise completely dries up. Still, this film at least has some connection to the original film unlike Halloween Resurrection or Halloween III. Not that I don't like Halloween III...

    After watching the 5 Halloween films, I heard that there was another film in the franchise and watched it to see if it would satisfy me. Then, I became a bit disappointed, but I don't think this film is as bad as the critics suggested that it was. It's flaws in it's own ways, but it does have some redeeming aspects that save this from getting a lower rating. While some of the actors fell flat, it's great to see Donald Pleasance again as Dr. Loomis (it's sad that he died since this was his last film role) and the new actors including Paul Rudd did fine with their roles. Michael Myers is spooky and scary once again and his make-up never fails to amuse me. The death scenes are both gory and very satisfying especially the part where Jamie Lloyd from Halloweens 4 & 5 died which gave me some chills here and there. The scenery is breathtaking and the directing is above-average. The music is pretty good captures the same suspenseful tone of the previous films very well along with some haunting moments. Now for the flaws. The story is pretty predictable. I liked the concept about the Thorn which was the reason why Michael Myers killed his sister in the original and is well explained, but it suffers from too many plot holes like one scene for example, how the heck did Michael move from one place to another so fast? The script is pretty messy with an abrupt ending that leaves sometime to be desired and the dialog is unbelievably terrible with some unfunny moments. The main protagonists are interesting enough, but most of the characters are flat and are only used at victims to Michael Myers. Even the pacing is a bit sluggish. Overall, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers would've been a much better sequel, but it's not as bad as some say it is. Recommended to those who haven't seen it, but for others, I'd stick to the previous films.

    "Halloween 5" (1989) was a rushed project with a ridiculous story and a stupid ending. It pretty much killed the franchise and it took six years before a new sequel was released. The rights once owned by Transcas Films were bought by Miramax/Dimension (a division of Buena Vista/Disney). The one brave thing this sequel has is that it's trying to explain the mess "Halloween 5" was. But unfortunately, the new story is potentially even dumber than Part 5. According to the movie, it's six years later. Jamie is being held by a cult and gives birth. How can than be, she's what, 14 years old ? We get a new actress, J.C. Brandy (the producers didn't want to pay Danielle Harris the 5000 euro for her return) who looks like she's almost 30 years old. She flees with her newborn baby (according to the producer's cut, Michael is the father (..)) Eitherway, the introduction of the baby is dumb. Michael Myers is not skilled or cunning in this one. For example, he's not able to figure out that Jamie hid her baby in the women's room of a bus station. Even though he's been there chasing her, and after he kills her, he even finds a paper roll of that same restroom in her car. It's a shame Jamie was killed off so quick in the Theatrical Cut, it was as dumb as killing off Rachel right at the beginning of Part 5. Than we're introduced to Tommy Doyle. One of the kids who Laurie Strode babysat in the original "Halloween". He's obsessed with Michael and finds the baby in the bathroom the next morning.

"Halloween 5" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful "Halloween: H20" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.

    I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying. The first film since Dimension (Disney) took over the franchise. The two movies that followed were considerably better H20 and Resurrection were better movies than this.This movie plays with the idea that Michael Myers can be controlled is ludicrous. It plays off the storyline from the last film that the curse came from something astrological, a constellation called thorn if memory serves. This movie lacks real scares. It replaces them with violent shocks. Sadly this would be Donald Pleasance's last appearance as Dr.Loomis.

    Part VI takes place six years after the fifth film ends, with a young woman(said to be Jamie Lloyd, but played by a different actress) escaping the mysterious cult that held her prisoner, along with her baby, with Michael Myers once again in murderous, relentless pursuit. She leaves the baby behind in a bus depot for safety, only to be brutally dispatched by Michael... However, a now grown Tommy Doyle(one of the kids that Laurie Strode babysat from the original) tracks down Doctor Loomis(played for the last time by a sickly Donald Pleasance) to take the baby themselves, leading to a showdown where many shocking revelations will be uncovered... Though well intended by writer Daniel Farrands as a satisfying finale to the series, this entry proved to be an unmitigated disaster, sabotaged by atrocious & shameful rewriting, editing and directing, rendering the film a crass, incoherent mess. Sad to say, Donald Pleasance's last film(he died before it was released).

    And so we arrive at the sixth instalment, by which time all ambiguity about Michael Myers has withered away thanks to this series' habit of pulling relatives out of nowhere and mucking about with its continuity. This one introduces the potty idea that Myers is controlled by runes that appear as a star constellation every Halloween and a cult is using them to... erm... well, this film is far from coherent and I kind of lost track of the plot after a while. Apparently there's a producer's cut that makes a lot more sense, but I haven't seen it so let's work with what we've got. In the plus column, Donald Pleasence, in his final film role (he deserved better), produces some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given, and Marianne Hagan is credible as a single mother and the only real character in the middle of all the monotonous deaths. And Paul Rudd has his moments in an early role. That's it for the positive aspects. There are so many things this film bungles, so many ways in which it loses credibility that after half an hour I gave up on it and sighed a lot. Mangling John Carpenter's sinister theme music by turning it into an action cue isn't a good start, but the film is also rife with ineffective false scares and embarrasses itself by referencing 'Rear Window'. Myers again moves around with inhuman speed, but that's the least of the problems when it comes to his actions. How does he string that DJ up in a tree? Why does he put one victim's bloodied clothes in a washing machine? Why does he take the time to hide her body in a tree, and how does he time it so she dangles down at exactly the right time? More questions: why does Hagan's father chop down a For Sale sign with an axe rather than pull it out of the ground? Why does a long, smooth corridor wall have a spike sticking out of it at just the right height to, say, impale a skull? Why does a nurse call security when faced with a desperate man claiming his baby needs medical attention? Why can't Kim Darby navigate through a garden full of obstacles no more dangerous than clothes on a washing line? How does Pleasence recognise the rune, which, if I'm not mistaken, was only previously seen at the end of the abysmal 'Halloween 5'? Does electrocution really make your head explode? And so on and so on and so on. 'Halloween III' remains the best (or should that be least worst) follow up if only because it gave us a break from the Michael Myers stuff, but this is by default the best of the sequels that feature him.

    After the major disappointment of the fifth one, 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' delivers the goods for fans as we find out the motivation behind Michael's killing spree. As you know, 'Halloween 5' ended with Jamie in the police station after some man in black killed all the cops. Well for six years, Jamie has been held against her will by that man and several of his twisted staff. She was also impregnated and now has a newborn baby. Sadly Michael murders, Jamie but could not find what he was really after - her baby boy. Tommy Doyle (the little boy from the first film!) is all grown up now, and still obsessed with what took place that night in 1978. He finds the baby where Jamie hid it from Michael, and spends the film with Kara Strode, her young son Danny and Dr. Loomis trying to keep it safe from the masked killer. I like 'Halloween 6' because it puts a real effort into taking us back to the original. We see Tommy Doyle, the little boy whom Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysat in 1978. We also get introduced to a part of the Strode family, the Strode's of course were the family that adopted Laurie from the Myers'. And the Myers house ACTUALLY resembles the original house, which of course it didn't in the fifth film. George Wilbur makes his return as Michael Myers. He played Michael in 'Halloween 4' and did a great job then, so it was glad to have him back after the underwhelming job Don Shanks did as the killer in part 5. The acting was good all around, in particular from the Strode family characters (Marianne Hagan, Kim Darby and Bradford English). And Donald Pleasence puts in a marvellous performance to end his brilliant career. The real story of this sixth instalment is that we find out WHY Michael has been killing for all of these years. We first saw the Thorn symbol in 'Halloween 5'. Well apparently, Michael was programmed as a child (using this Pagan/Magical Thorn symbol) to kill his family! They give a large explanation on this, but basically when the Thorn symbol appears in the stars on Halloween night each year, it prompts Michael to murder. It explains the method behind Michael's madness. It's a bit far fetched of course, but I liked the efforts to bring a refreshing twist to the story. And it ties all the loose ends we were left with in 'Halloween 5'. Although I liked the idea of Thorn because it brought life to the series, I also view it as a flaw. I think it was far more dark not knowing what was behind Michael's wanting to kill his family. It made him more creepy and insane. Knowing that he was controlled to do what he did for years, only tarnishes his villainous reputation and makes viewers almost sympathize. The gore was good in this, a step up from 'Halloween 5'. And we get some good eerie atmospheric scenes within the streets of Haddonfield. It brings back some genuine scares to the series. Check it out! 6/10

    Michael Myers (hulking George Wilbur) returns once more to Haddonfield, Illinois to resume his killing spree. It's up to troubled Tommy Doyle (well played by Paul Rudd) and Dr. Loomis (a game, but wasted Donald Pleasence, who's given precious little screen time) to stop Myers. Director Joe Chappelle not only crucially fails to develop any suspense or spooky atmosphere, but also goes way overboard with loads of ugly violence and cheap jump-out-at-you fake scares. Worse yet, the wrongheaded script by Daniel Farrands makes a grievous blunder by providing some kind of ridiculous Druid cult back story for Myers, thus completely undermining Myers' status as the embodiment of pure evil as established in the previous films in the series. Moreover, this picture further suffers from a foul mean-spirited tone that hangs heavy over everything like a putrid fog; placing a newborn baby in considerable jeopardy rates as an especially gross and offensive error on the part of the filmmakers. The plodding pace, clumsy use of flash cutting, and a blaring guitar riff during the murders don't help matters any. Ditto the brutal killing of the Jamie Lloyd character and Loomis' lame send-off. On the plus side, Marianne Hagan contributes an appealing turn as the sympathetic Kara Strode, Mitchell Ryan makes for a nice villain as the sinister Dr. Terence Wynn, and the fetching Mariah O'Brien as the brash Beth bares her sweet perky breasts prior to meeting a harsh untimely end. A real disappointment.

    Here's why. Through 4 movies leading up to Curse of Michael Myers, we see him get stabbed, shot, run over, set on fire, blown up, etc. He always comes back stronger than ever though! This film explains that Michael was given special powers by the Cult of Thorn on Halloween night when he was a boy (the opening scene in the original Halloween). Aside from that, it's just another chance to see Michael Myers in action. Pretty weak reasons, I know, but if you love the Halloween franchise, you can't not see this movie...if for anything for the last appearance of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). This film could have been better if it worked on the plot a little better, however. Of course Halloween, like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street was just about squeezing out the dollars...much like the modern Saw films or Paranormal Activity; the idea is to do as many sequels as possible before the franchise completely dries up. Still, this film at least has some connection to the original film unlike Halloween Resurrection or Halloween III. Not that I don't like Halloween III...

    After watching the 5 Halloween films, I heard that there was another film in the franchise and watched it to see if it would satisfy me. Then, I became a bit disappointed, but I don't think this film is as bad as the critics suggested that it was. It's flaws in it's own ways, but it does have some redeeming aspects that save this from getting a lower rating. While some of the actors fell flat, it's great to see Donald Pleasance again as Dr. Loomis (it's sad that he died since this was his last film role) and the new actors including Paul Rudd did fine with their roles. Michael Myers is spooky and scary once again and his make-up never fails to amuse me. The death scenes are both gory and very satisfying especially the part where Jamie Lloyd from Halloweens 4 & 5 died which gave me some chills here and there. The scenery is breathtaking and the directing is above-average. The music is pretty good captures the same suspenseful tone of the previous films very well along with some haunting moments. Now for the flaws. The story is pretty predictable. I liked the concept about the Thorn which was the reason why Michael Myers killed his sister in the original and is well explained, but it suffers from too many plot holes like one scene for example, how the heck did Michael move from one place to another so fast? The script is pretty messy with an abrupt ending that leaves sometime to be desired and the dialog is unbelievably terrible with some unfunny moments. The main protagonists are interesting enough, but most of the characters are flat and are only used at victims to Michael Myers. Even the pacing is a bit sluggish. Overall, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers would've been a much better sequel, but it's not as bad as some say it is. Recommended to those who haven't seen it, but for others, I'd stick to the previous films.

    "Halloween 5" (1989) was a rushed project with a ridiculous story and a stupid ending. It pretty much killed the franchise and it took six years before a new sequel was released. The rights once owned by Transcas Films were bought by Miramax/Dimension (a division of Buena Vista/Disney). The one brave thing this sequel has is that it's trying to explain the mess "Halloween 5" was. But unfortunately, the new story is potentially even dumber than Part 5. According to the movie, it's six years later. Jamie is being held by a cult and gives birth. How can than be, she's what, 14 years old ? We get a new actress, J.C. Brandy (the producers didn't want to pay Danielle Harris the 5000 euro for her return) who looks like she's almost 30 years old. She flees with her newborn baby (according to the producer's cut, Michael is the father (..)) Eitherway, the introduction of the baby is dumb. Michael Myers is not skilled or cunning in this one. For example, he's not able to figure out that Jamie hid her baby in the women's room of a bus station. Even though he's been there chasing her, and after he kills her, he even finds a paper roll of that same restroom in her car. It's a shame Jamie was killed off so quick in the Theatrical Cut, it was as dumb as killing off Rachel right at the beginning of Part 5. Than we're introduced to Tommy Doyle. One of the kids who Laurie Strode babysat in the original "Halloween". He's obsessed with Michael and finds the baby in the bathroom the next morning. Apparently, it's not a popular bathroom since no one has been there that entire time for about 12 hours. Must be because of the massive blood trail Jamie left the night before that no one bothered to clean up. There's also a new family in the old Myers house. They are relatives of the Strode family who adopted Laurie after Michael killed her sister in the original. Besides the father, the family doesn't know that they live in the Myers house. Rather silly when you think about it. Again, it's not the original house they used in the classic, but it's not as silly as the "Old Myers house" in Part 5. The story makes no sense at all, trying to explain why Michael kills. The evil cult thing is awful. The reveal of the mysterious man in black is unbelievable. Remember, he's the one who took out an entire police station like the Terminator at the end of Part 5. Main reason for the messy story is that half the movie was re-shot and re-edited. The Producer's Cut has a way better story but it's still not a very good movie. It has much more scenes with Donald Pleasance and the music is way better. This Theatrical Cut suffers from a lame and incoherent story, very bad editing, unnecessary gore and an unsatisfying ending. Michael Myers is once again played by stuntman George P. Wilbur (he was also Myers in Halloween 4) but here his moves and posture are just not right. He looks more like Jason Voorhees in this one. The cast is not even that bad compared to Part 5. Paul Stephen Rudd (he also starred in "Clueless" that year) plays his part very well, just as Marianne Hagan. Mitchel P. Ryan is underused since he's a great actor and has more potential (Lethal Weapon).It's sad to see that Donald Pleasence's role has almost been reduced to a cameo. He's the only one who held up the "Halloween" franchise. Too bad director Chapelle cut out a lot of his scenes for the the Theatrical Cut. I'v always been a big fan of "Halloween" and horror films in general. The first one remains the best. "Halloween II" (1981) was a very well made sequel that was almost as good as the original. After that, my most favorite "Halloween" is "H20": It was fresh, revived the franchise, had Jamie Lee Curtis and a scary Michael again and went back to the roots of this franchise. "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers" (1988) was a solid entry with great performances by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris. Since that one was a success, a sequel had to be in theaters the next year to compete with Jason and Freddy. Unfortunately, 1989 turned out to be a very bad year for horror: "Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan", "Nightmare 5: The Dream Child" and "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers" had 2 things in common: they all did very poorly at the box office and were among the worst in their franchises. "Halloween 5" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful "Halloween: H20" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.

    The sixth entry in the Halloween franchise picks up some years after the conclusion of Halloween 5. Jamie Lloyd is now a full grown adult, and she's just given birth. Unfortunately for her, Jamie has been kept in the basement of Smith's Grove Sanitarium (the facility that has housed Michael during his stints in and out of custody) by the likes of an underground Druid cult that seeks to somehow restore the once great night of Halloween to its former glory. What that former glory entails is anyone's guess; some gibberish about mayhem, bonfires and star alignments is thrown into the mix, but said references are every bit as vague as they sound. The question you likely have is this: How does Michael Myers fit into all this ridiculousness? Well, as the previous movies have indicated, he's somehow connected to the Druid sacrificial rite, but a lucid explanation of the exact role he plays isyet againconspicuously absent. I suppose it doesn't really matter, though; he's still alive, still angry, and still killing people. Once again he's after the last living remnant of the Myers bloodline, the newborn baby of his aforementioned niece. Oddly enough, Tommy Doyleone of the children from the original Halloween that Laurie babysat "the night he came home"has become obsessed with the persistent rumors about Michael and has rented a room across the street from the Myers house to keep tabs on its residents, one of whom is a kid with the same penchant for murder that Michael himself demonstrated so many years ago. Loomis is back, too. He is, of course, not surprised in the least when Michael reappears in Haddonfield, and the usual hijinks ensue (namely, people don't believe the famed serial killer is still alive, make the mistake of writing him off, and end up getting axed in oh-so-creative ways). The atmosphere generated in the movie is admirable, and this is one of Michael's more menacing outings. Still, one can't help but feel disappointed by the lack of story development, and the movie's conclusion feels much too abrupt. This almost certainly is a direct result of director Joe Chappelle's apparent distaste for Pleasence. According to the Internet Movie Database, Chappelle found many of Pleasence's scenes "boring," and thus engaged in heavy editing in an effort to trim down his presence in the movie. The result is a disjointed affair that's not nearly as effective as it could have been. In short, The Curse of Michael Myers is a convoluted mess that only pretends to answer some of the longstanding questions surrounding the Halloween mythology. The movie has its moments, and the presence of Paul Rudd as the now adult Doyle adds some memorability to the cast of characters.

    Trying to move on with her life, a woman moves back to her hometown unaware of her connection to the Michael Myers bloodline and faces his wrath when he escapes from a sanitarium and resumes his blood-soaked rampage in town. This one here manages to be one of the more enjoyable entries in the series and might very well better than the original. One of the strongest elements for this one derives numerous positive attributes from is the fact that, as a straight Slasher movie, this delivers impeccably. These should feature an imposing killer, which this one has in spades. The creepy mask has never looked better, the more hulking shape to his body is more credible for doling out the more strenuous physical action and the walk is genuinely creepy, a complete stalk and slash attitude, coming relentlessly with no remorse offered to his victims. As well, there's plenty to love about the graphic kills and deaths here, which is one of the best angles here with just a ton of greatness provided with a wide variety of kills delivered with a generous dose of methods, from stabbing to impaling to thrusting into the body and bare-handed, among others, to provide a spectacular array of bloody deaths dished out rather nicely. As well, the fact that this is pretty creepy at times is important as it adds an extra layer to the film with a large quantity of quality suspenseful scenes, from the opening underground escape and bus station stalking to the sneak-attack on the babysitter and the rampage through the hospital, it provides some really chilling moments that work well and give this an outstanding pace. While the story might be give-or-take depending on how you feel it connects to the rest of the series, it's really the only thing wrong here as this is an otherwise outstanding effort. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a brief sex scene.

Moreover, this picture further suffers from a foul mean-spirited tone that hangs heavy over everything like a putrid fog; placing a newborn baby in considerable jeopardy rates as an especially gross and offensive error on the part of the filmmakers. The plodding pace, clumsy use of flash cutting, and a blaring guitar riff during the murders don't help matters any. Ditto the brutal killing of the Jamie Lloyd character and Loomis' lame send-off. On the plus side, Marianne Hagan contributes an appealing turn as the sympathetic Kara Strode, Mitchell Ryan makes for a nice villain as the sinister Dr. Terence Wynn, and the fetching Mariah O'Brien as the brash Beth bares her sweet perky breasts prior to meeting a harsh untimely end. A real disappointment.

    Here's why. Through 4 movies leading up to Curse of Michael Myers, we see him get stabbed, shot, run over, set on fire, blown up, etc. He always comes back stronger than ever though! This film explains that Michael was given special powers by the Cult of Thorn on Halloween night when he was a boy (the opening scene in the original Halloween). Aside from that, it's just another chance to see Michael Myers in action. Pretty weak reasons, I know, but if you love the Halloween franchise, you can't not see this movie...if for anything for the last appearance of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). This film could have been better if it worked on the plot a little better, however. Of course Halloween, like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street was just about squeezing out the dollars...much like the modern Saw films or Paranormal Activity; the idea is to do as many sequels as possible before the franchise completely dries up. Still, this film at least has some connection to the original film unlike Halloween Resurrection or Halloween III. Not that I don't like Halloween III...

    After watching the 5 Halloween films, I heard that there was another film in the franchise and watched it to see if it would satisfy me. Then, I became a bit disappointed, but I don't think this film is as bad as the critics suggested that it was. It's flaws in it's own ways, but it does have some redeeming aspects that save this from getting a lower rating. While some of the actors fell flat, it's great to see Donald Pleasance again as Dr. Loomis (it's sad that he died since this was his last film role) and the new actors including Paul Rudd did fine with their roles. Michael Myers is spooky and scary once again and his make-up never fails to amuse me. The death scenes are both gory and very satisfying especially the part where Jamie Lloyd from Halloweens 4 & 5 died which gave me some chills here and there. The scenery is breathtaking and the directing is above-average. The music is pretty good captures the same suspenseful tone of the previous films very well along with some haunting moments. Now for the flaws. The story is pretty predictable. I liked the concept about the Thorn which was the reason why Michael Myers killed his sister in the original and is well explained, but it suffers from too many plot holes like one scene for example, how the heck did Michael move from one place to another so fast? The script is pretty messy with an abrupt ending that leaves sometime to be desired and the dialog is unbelievably terrible with some unfunny moments. The main protagonists are interesting enough, but most of the characters are flat and are only used at victims to Michael Myers. Even the pacing is a bit sluggish. Overall, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers would've been a much better sequel, but it's not as bad as some say it is. Recommended to those who haven't seen it, but for others, I'd stick to the previous films.

    "Halloween 5" (1989) was a rushed project with a ridiculous story and a stupid ending. It pretty much killed the franchise and it took six years before a new sequel was released. The rights once owned by Transcas Films were bought by Miramax/Dimension (a division of Buena Vista/Disney). The one brave thing this sequel has is that it's trying to explain the mess "Halloween 5" was. But unfortunately, the new story is potentially even dumber than Part 5. According to the movie, it's six years later. Jamie is being held by a cult and gives birth. How can than be, she's what, 14 years old ? We get a new actress, J.C. Brandy (the producers didn't want to pay Danielle Harris the 5000 euro for her return) who looks like she's almost 30 years old. She flees with her newborn baby (according to the producer's cut, Michael is the father (..)) Eitherway, the introduction of the baby is dumb. Michael Myers is not skilled or cunning in this one. For example, he's not able to figure out that Jamie hid her baby in the women's room of a bus station. Even though he's been there chasing her, and after he kills her, he even finds a paper roll of that same restroom in her car. It's a shame Jamie was killed off so quick in the Theatrical Cut, it was as dumb as killing off Rachel right at the beginning of Part 5. Than we're introduced to Tommy Doyle. One of the kids who Laurie Strode babysat in the original "Halloween". He's obsessed with Michael and finds the baby in the bathroom the next morning. Apparently, it's not a popular bathroom since no one has been there that entire time for about 12 hours. Must be because of the massive blood trail Jamie left the night before that no one bothered to clean up. There's also a new family in the old Myers house. They are relatives of the Strode family who adopted Laurie after Michael killed her sister in the original. Besides the father, the family doesn't know that they live in the Myers house. Rather silly when you think about it. Again, it's not the original house they used in the classic, but it's not as silly as the "Old Myers house" in Part 5. The story makes no sense at all, trying to explain why Michael kills. The evil cult thing is awful. The reveal of the mysterious man in black is unbelievable. Remember, he's the one who took out an entire police station like the Terminator at the end of Part 5. Main reason for the messy story is that half the movie was re-shot and re-edited. The Producer's Cut has a way better story but it's still not a very good movie. It has much more scenes with Donald Pleasance and the music is way better. This Theatrical Cut suffers from a lame and incoherent story, very bad editing, unnecessary gore and an unsatisfying ending. Michael Myers is once again played by stuntman George P. Wilbur (he was also Myers in Halloween 4) but here his moves and posture are just not right. He looks more like Jason Voorhees in this one. The cast is not even that bad compared to Part 5. Paul Stephen Rudd (he also starred in "Clueless" that year) plays his part very well, just as Marianne Hagan. Mitchel P. Ryan is underused since he's a great actor and has more potential (Lethal Weapon).It's sad to see that Donald Pleasence's role has almost been reduced to a cameo. He's the only one who held up the "Halloween" franchise. Too bad director Chapelle cut out a lot of his scenes for the the Theatrical Cut. I'v always been a big fan of "Halloween" and horror films in general. The first one remains the best. "Halloween II" (1981) was a very well made sequel that was almost as good as the original. After that, my most favorite "Halloween" is "H20": It was fresh, revived the franchise, had Jamie Lee Curtis and a scary Michael again and went back to the roots of this franchise. "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers" (1988) was a solid entry with great performances by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris. Since that one was a success, a sequel had to be in theaters the next year to compete with Jason and Freddy. Unfortunately, 1989 turned out to be a very bad year for horror: "Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan", "Nightmare 5: The Dream Child" and "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers" had 2 things in common: they all did very poorly at the box office and were among the worst in their franchises. "Halloween 5" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful "Halloween: H20" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.

    The sixth entry in the Halloween franchise picks up some years after the conclusion of Halloween 5. Jamie Lloyd is now a full grown adult, and she's just given birth. Unfortunately for her, Jamie has been kept in the basement of Smith's Grove Sanitarium (the facility that has housed Michael during his stints in and out of custody) by the likes of an underground Druid cult that seeks to somehow restore the once great night of Halloween to its former glory. What that former glory entails is anyone's guess; some gibberish about mayhem, bonfires and star alignments is thrown into the mix, but said references are every bit as vague as they sound. The question you likely have is this: How does Michael Myers fit into all this ridiculousness? Well, as the previous movies have indicated, he's somehow connected to the Druid sacrificial rite, but a lucid explanation of the exact role he plays isyet againconspicuously absent. I suppose it doesn't really matter, though; he's still alive, still angry, and still killing people. Once again he's after the last living remnant of the Myers bloodline, the newborn baby of his aforementioned niece. Oddly enough, Tommy Doyleone of the children from the original Halloween that Laurie babysat "the night he came home"has become obsessed with the persistent rumors about Michael and has rented a room across the street from the Myers house to keep tabs on its residents, one of whom is a kid with the same penchant for murder that Michael himself demonstrated so many years ago. Loomis is back, too. He is, of course, not surprised in the least when Michael reappears in Haddonfield, and the usual hijinks ensue (namely, people don't believe the famed serial killer is still alive, make the mistake of writing him off, and end up getting axed in oh-so-creative ways). The atmosphere generated in the movie is admirable, and this is one of Michael's more menacing outings. Still, one can't help but feel disappointed by the lack of story development, and the movie's conclusion feels much too abrupt. This almost certainly is a direct result of director Joe Chappelle's apparent distaste for Pleasence. According to the Internet Movie Database, Chappelle found many of Pleasence's scenes "boring," and thus engaged in heavy editing in an effort to trim down his presence in the movie. The result is a disjointed affair that's not nearly as effective as it could have been. In short, The Curse of Michael Myers is a convoluted mess that only pretends to answer some of the longstanding questions surrounding the Halloween mythology. The movie has its moments, and the presence of Paul Rudd as the now adult Doyle adds some memorability to the cast of characters.

    Trying to move on with her life, a woman moves back to her hometown unaware of her connection to the Michael Myers bloodline and faces his wrath when he escapes from a sanitarium and resumes his blood-soaked rampage in town. This one here manages to be one of the more enjoyable entries in the series and might very well better than the original. One of the strongest elements for this one derives numerous positive attributes from is the fact that, as a straight Slasher movie, this delivers impeccably. These should feature an imposing killer, which this one has in spades. The creepy mask has never looked better, the more hulking shape to his body is more credible for doling out the more strenuous physical action and the walk is genuinely creepy, a complete stalk and slash attitude, coming relentlessly with no remorse offered to his victims. As well, there's plenty to love about the graphic kills and deaths here, which is one of the best angles here with just a ton of greatness provided with a wide variety of kills delivered with a generous dose of methods, from stabbing to impaling to thrusting into the body and bare-handed, among others, to provide a spectacular array of bloody deaths dished out rather nicely. As well, the fact that this is pretty creepy at times is important as it adds an extra layer to the film with a large quantity of quality suspenseful scenes, from the opening underground escape and bus station stalking to the sneak-attack on the babysitter and the rampage through the hospital, it provides some really chilling moments that work well and give this an outstanding pace. While the story might be give-or-take depending on how you feel it connects to the rest of the series, it's really the only thing wrong here as this is an otherwise outstanding effort. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a brief sex scene.

    I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying. The first film since Dimension (Disney) took over the franchise. The two movies that followed were considerably better H20 and Resurrection were better movies than this.This movie plays with the idea that Michael Myers can be controlled is ludicrous. It plays off the storyline from the last film that the curse came from something astrological, a constellation called thorn if memory serves. This movie lacks real scares. It replaces them with violent shocks. Sadly this would be Donald Pleasance's last appearance as Dr.Loomis.

    Part VI takes place six years after the fifth film ends, with a young woman(said to be Jamie Lloyd, but played by a different actress) escaping the mysterious cult that held her prisoner, along with her baby, with Michael Myers once again in murderous, relentless pursuit. She leaves the baby behind in a bus depot for safety, only to be brutally dispatched by Michael... However, a now grown Tommy Doyle(one of the kids that Laurie Strode babysat from the original) tracks down Doctor Loomis(played for the last time by a sickly Donald Pleasance) to take the baby themselves, leading to a showdown where many shocking revelations will be uncovered... Though well intended by writer Daniel Farrands as a satisfying finale to the series, this entry proved to be an unmitigated disaster, sabotaged by atrocious & shameful rewriting, editing and directing, rendering the film a crass, incoherent mess. Sad to say, Donald Pleasance's last film(he died before it was released).

    And so we arrive at the sixth instalment, by which time all ambiguity about Michael Myers has withered away thanks to this series' habit of pulling relatives out of nowhere and mucking about with its continuity. This one introduces the potty idea that Myers is controlled by runes that appear as a star constellation every Halloween and a cult is using them to... erm... well, this film is far from coherent and I kind of lost track of the plot after a while. Apparently there's a producer's cut that makes a lot more sense, but I haven't seen it so let's work with what we've got. In the plus column, Donald Pleasence, in his final film role (he deserved better), produces some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given, and Marianne Hagan is credible as a single mother and the only real character in the middle of all the monotonous deaths. And Paul Rudd has his moments in an early role. That's it for the positive aspects. There are so many things this film bungles, so many ways in which it loses credibility that after half an hour I gave up on it and sighed a lot. Mangling John Carpenter's sinister theme music by turning it into an action cue isn't a good start, but the film is also rife with ineffective false scares and embarrasses itself by referencing 'Rear Window'. Myers again moves around with inhuman speed, but that's the least of the problems when it comes to his actions. How does he string that DJ up in a tree? Why does he put one victim's bloodied clothes in a washing machine? Why does he take the time to hide her body in a tree, and how does he time it so she dangles down at exactly the right time? More questions: why does Hagan's father chop down a For Sale sign with an axe rather than pull it out of the ground? Why does a long, smooth corridor wall have a spike sticking out of it at just the right height to, say, impale a skull? Why does a nurse call security when faced with a desperate man claiming his baby needs medical attention? Why can't Kim Darby navigate through a garden full of obstacles no more dangerous than clothes on a washing line? How does Pleasence recognise the rune, which, if I'm not mistaken, was only previously seen at the end of the abysmal 'Halloween 5'? Does electrocution really make your head explode? And so on and so on and so on. 'Halloween III' remains the best (or should that be least worst) follow up if only because it gave us a break from the Michael Myers stuff, but this is by default the best of the sequels that feature him.

    After the major disappointment of the fifth one, 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' delivers the goods for fans as we find out the motivation behind Michael's killing spree. As you know, 'Halloween 5' ended with Jamie in the police station after some man in black killed all the cops. Well for six years, Jamie has been held against her will by that man and several of his twisted staff. She was also impregnated and now has a newborn baby. Sadly Michael murders, Jamie but could not find what he was really after - her baby boy. Tommy Doyle (the little boy from the first film!) is all grown up now, and still obsessed with what took place that night in 1978. He finds the baby where Jamie hid it from Michael, and spends the film with Kara Strode, her young son Danny and Dr. Loomis trying to keep it safe from the masked killer. I like 'Halloween 6' because it puts a real effort into taking us back to the original. We see Tommy Doyle, the little boy whom Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysat in 1978. We also get introduced to a part of the Strode family, the Strode's of course were the family that adopted Laurie from the Myers'. And the Myers house ACTUALLY resembles the original house, which of course it didn't in the fifth film. George Wilbur makes his return as Michael Myers. He played Michael in 'Halloween 4' and did a great job then, so it was glad to have him back after the underwhelming job Don Shanks did as the killer in part 5. The acting was good all around, in particular from the Strode family characters (Marianne Hagan, Kim Darby and Bradford English). And Donald Pleasence puts in a marvellous performance to end his brilliant career. The real story of this sixth instalment is that we find out WHY Michael has been killing for all of these years. We first saw the Thorn symbol in 'Halloween 5'. Well apparently, Michael was programmed as a child (using this Pagan/Magical Thorn symbol) to kill his family! They give a large explanation on this, but basically when the Thorn symbol appears in the stars on Halloween night each year, it prompts Michael to murder. It explains the method behind Michael's madness. It's a bit far fetched of course, but I liked the efforts to bring a refreshing twist to the story. And it ties all the loose ends we were left with in 'Halloween 5'. Although I liked the idea of Thorn because it brought life to the series, I also view it as a flaw. I think it was far more dark not knowing what was behind Michael's wanting to kill his family. It made him more creepy and insane. Knowing that he was controlled to do what he did for years, only tarnishes his villainous reputation and makes viewers almost sympathize. The gore was good in this, a step up from 'Halloween 5'. And we get some good eerie atmospheric scenes within the streets of Haddonfield. It brings back some genuine scares to the series. Check it out! 6/10

    Michael Myers (hulking George Wilbur) returns once more to Haddonfield, Illinois to resume his killing spree. It's up to troubled Tommy Doyle (well played by Paul Rudd) and Dr. Loomis (a game, but wasted Donald Pleasence, who's given precious little screen time) to stop Myers. Director Joe Chappelle not only crucially fails to develop any suspense or spooky atmosphere, but also goes way overboard with loads of ugly violence and cheap jump-out-at-you fake scares. Worse yet, the wrongheaded script by Daniel Farrands makes a grievous blunder by providing some kind of ridiculous Druid cult back story for Myers, thus completely undermining Myers' status as the embodiment of pure evil as established in the previous films in the series. Moreover, this picture further suffers from a foul mean-spirited tone that hangs heavy over everything like a putrid fog; placing a newborn baby in considerable jeopardy rates as an especially gross and offensive error on the part of the filmmakers. The plodding pace, clumsy use of flash cutting, and a blaring guitar riff during the murders don't help matters any. Ditto the brutal killing of the Jamie Lloyd character and Loomis' lame send-off.

Since that one was a success, a sequel had to be in theaters the next year to compete with Jason and Freddy. Unfortunately, 1989 turned out to be a very bad year for horror: "Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan", "Nightmare 5: The Dream Child" and "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers" had 2 things in common: they all did very poorly at the box office and were among the worst in their franchises. "Halloween 5" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful "Halloween: H20" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.

    The sixth entry in the Halloween franchise picks up some years after the conclusion of Halloween 5. Jamie Lloyd is now a full grown adult, and she's just given birth. Unfortunately for her, Jamie has been kept in the basement of Smith's Grove Sanitarium (the facility that has housed Michael during his stints in and out of custody) by the likes of an underground Druid cult that seeks to somehow restore the once great night of Halloween to its former glory. What that former glory entails is anyone's guess; some gibberish about mayhem, bonfires and star alignments is thrown into the mix, but said references are every bit as vague as they sound. The question you likely have is this: How does Michael Myers fit into all this ridiculousness? Well, as the previous movies have indicated, he's somehow connected to the Druid sacrificial rite, but a lucid explanation of the exact role he plays isyet againconspicuously absent. I suppose it doesn't really matter, though; he's still alive, still angry, and still killing people. Once again he's after the last living remnant of the Myers bloodline, the newborn baby of his aforementioned niece. Oddly enough, Tommy Doyleone of the children from the original Halloween that Laurie babysat "the night he came home"has become obsessed with the persistent rumors about Michael and has rented a room across the street from the Myers house to keep tabs on its residents, one of whom is a kid with the same penchant for murder that Michael himself demonstrated so many years ago. Loomis is back, too. He is, of course, not surprised in the least when Michael reappears in Haddonfield, and the usual hijinks ensue (namely, people don't believe the famed serial killer is still alive, make the mistake of writing him off, and end up getting axed in oh-so-creative ways). The atmosphere generated in the movie is admirable, and this is one of Michael's more menacing outings. Still, one can't help but feel disappointed by the lack of story development, and the movie's conclusion feels much too abrupt. This almost certainly is a direct result of director Joe Chappelle's apparent distaste for Pleasence. According to the Internet Movie Database, Chappelle found many of Pleasence's scenes "boring," and thus engaged in heavy editing in an effort to trim down his presence in the movie. The result is a disjointed affair that's not nearly as effective as it could have been. In short, The Curse of Michael Myers is a convoluted mess that only pretends to answer some of the longstanding questions surrounding the Halloween mythology. The movie has its moments, and the presence of Paul Rudd as the now adult Doyle adds some memorability to the cast of characters.

    Trying to move on with her life, a woman moves back to her hometown unaware of her connection to the Michael Myers bloodline and faces his wrath when he escapes from a sanitarium and resumes his blood-soaked rampage in town. This one here manages to be one of the more enjoyable entries in the series and might very well better than the original. One of the strongest elements for this one derives numerous positive attributes from is the fact that, as a straight Slasher movie, this delivers impeccably. These should feature an imposing killer, which this one has in spades. The creepy mask has never looked better, the more hulking shape to his body is more credible for doling out the more strenuous physical action and the walk is genuinely creepy, a complete stalk and slash attitude, coming relentlessly with no remorse offered to his victims. As well, there's plenty to love about the graphic kills and deaths here, which is one of the best angles here with just a ton of greatness provided with a wide variety of kills delivered with a generous dose of methods, from stabbing to impaling to thrusting into the body and bare-handed, among others, to provide a spectacular array of bloody deaths dished out rather nicely. As well, the fact that this is pretty creepy at times is important as it adds an extra layer to the film with a large quantity of quality suspenseful scenes, from the opening underground escape and bus station stalking to the sneak-attack on the babysitter and the rampage through the hospital, it provides some really chilling moments that work well and give this an outstanding pace. While the story might be give-or-take depending on how you feel it connects to the rest of the series, it's really the only thing wrong here as this is an otherwise outstanding effort. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a brief sex scene.

    I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying. The first film since Dimension (Disney) took over the franchise. The two movies that followed were considerably better H20 and Resurrection were better movies than this.This movie plays with the idea that Michael Myers can be controlled is ludicrous. It plays off the storyline from the last film that the curse came from something astrological, a constellation called thorn if memory serves. This movie lacks real scares. It replaces them with violent shocks. Sadly this would be Donald Pleasance's last appearance as Dr.Loomis.

    Part VI takes place six years after the fifth film ends, with a young woman(said to be Jamie Lloyd, but played by a different actress) escaping the mysterious cult that held her prisoner, along with her baby, with Michael Myers once again in murderous, relentless pursuit. She leaves the baby behind in a bus depot for safety, only to be brutally dispatched by Michael... However, a now grown Tommy Doyle(one of the kids that Laurie Strode babysat from the original) tracks down Doctor Loomis(played for the last time by a sickly Donald Pleasance) to take the baby themselves, leading to a showdown where many shocking revelations will be uncovered... Though well intended by writer Daniel Farrands as a satisfying finale to the series, this entry proved to be an unmitigated disaster, sabotaged by atrocious & shameful rewriting, editing and directing, rendering the film a crass, incoherent mess. Sad to say, Donald Pleasance's last film(he died before it was released).

    And so we arrive at the sixth instalment, by which time all ambiguity about Michael Myers has withered away thanks to this series' habit of pulling relatives out of nowhere and mucking about with its continuity. This one introduces the potty idea that Myers is controlled by runes that appear as a star constellation every Halloween and a cult is using them to... erm... well, this film is far from coherent and I kind of lost track of the plot after a while. Apparently there's a producer's cut that makes a lot more sense, but I haven't seen it so let's work with what we've got. In the plus column, Donald Pleasence, in his final film role (he deserved better), produces some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given, and Marianne Hagan is credible as a single mother and the only real character in the middle of all the monotonous deaths. And Paul Rudd has his moments in an early role. That's it for the positive aspects. There are so many things this film bungles, so many ways in which it loses credibility that after half an hour I gave up on it and sighed a lot. Mangling John Carpenter's sinister theme music by turning it into an action cue isn't a good start, but the film is also rife with ineffective false scares and embarrasses itself by referencing 'Rear Window'. Myers again moves around with inhuman speed, but that's the least of the problems when it comes to his actions. How does he string that DJ up in a tree? Why does he put one victim's bloodied clothes in a washing machine? Why does he take the time to hide her body in a tree, and how does he time it so she dangles down at exactly the right time? More questions: why does Hagan's father chop down a For Sale sign with an axe rather than pull it out of the ground? Why does a long, smooth corridor wall have a spike sticking out of it at just the right height to, say, impale a skull? Why does a nurse call security when faced with a desperate man claiming his baby needs medical attention? Why can't Kim Darby navigate through a garden full of obstacles no more dangerous than clothes on a washing line? How does Pleasence recognise the rune, which, if I'm not mistaken, was only previously seen at the end of the abysmal 'Halloween 5'? Does electrocution really make your head explode? And so on and so on and so on. 'Halloween III' remains the best (or should that be least worst) follow up if only because it gave us a break from the Michael Myers stuff, but this is by default the best of the sequels that feature him.

    After the major disappointment of the fifth one, 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' delivers the goods for fans as we find out the motivation behind Michael's killing spree. As you know, 'Halloween 5' ended with Jamie in the police station after some man in black killed all the cops. Well for six years, Jamie has been held against her will by that man and several of his twisted staff. She was also impregnated and now has a newborn baby. Sadly Michael murders, Jamie but could not find what he was really after - her baby boy. Tommy Doyle (the little boy from the first film!) is all grown up now, and still obsessed with what took place that night in 1978. He finds the baby where Jamie hid it from Michael, and spends the film with Kara Strode, her young son Danny and Dr. Loomis trying to keep it safe from the masked killer. I like 'Halloween 6' because it puts a real effort into taking us back to the original. We see Tommy Doyle, the little boy whom Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysat in 1978. We also get introduced to a part of the Strode family, the Strode's of course were the family that adopted Laurie from the Myers'. And the Myers house ACTUALLY resembles the original house, which of course it didn't in the fifth film. George Wilbur makes his return as Michael Myers. He played Michael in 'Halloween 4' and did a great job then, so it was glad to have him back after the underwhelming job Don Shanks did as the killer in part 5. The acting was good all around, in particular from the Strode family characters (Marianne Hagan, Kim Darby and Bradford English). And Donald Pleasence puts in a marvellous performance to end his brilliant career. The real story of this sixth instalment is that we find out WHY Michael has been killing for all of these years. We first saw the Thorn symbol in 'Halloween 5'. Well apparently, Michael was programmed as a child (using this Pagan/Magical Thorn symbol) to kill his family! They give a large explanation on this, but basically when the Thorn symbol appears in the stars on Halloween night each year, it prompts Michael to murder. It explains the method behind Michael's madness. It's a bit far fetched of course, but I liked the efforts to bring a refreshing twist to the story. And it ties all the loose ends we were left with in 'Halloween 5'. Although I liked the idea of Thorn because it brought life to the series, I also view it as a flaw. I think it was far more dark not knowing what was behind Michael's wanting to kill his family. It made him more creepy and insane. Knowing that he was controlled to do what he did for years, only tarnishes his villainous reputation and makes viewers almost sympathize. The gore was good in this, a step up from 'Halloween 5'. And we get some good eerie atmospheric scenes within the streets of Haddonfield. It brings back some genuine scares to the series. Check it out! 6/10

    Michael Myers (hulking George Wilbur) returns once more to Haddonfield, Illinois to resume his killing spree. It's up to troubled Tommy Doyle (well played by Paul Rudd) and Dr. Loomis (a game, but wasted Donald Pleasence, who's given precious little screen time) to stop Myers. Director Joe Chappelle not only crucially fails to develop any suspense or spooky atmosphere, but also goes way overboard with loads of ugly violence and cheap jump-out-at-you fake scares. Worse yet, the wrongheaded script by Daniel Farrands makes a grievous blunder by providing some kind of ridiculous Druid cult back story for Myers, thus completely undermining Myers' status as the embodiment of pure evil as established in the previous films in the series. Moreover, this picture further suffers from a foul mean-spirited tone that hangs heavy over everything like a putrid fog; placing a newborn baby in considerable jeopardy rates as an especially gross and offensive error on the part of the filmmakers. The plodding pace, clumsy use of flash cutting, and a blaring guitar riff during the murders don't help matters any. Ditto the brutal killing of the Jamie Lloyd character and Loomis' lame send-off. On the plus side, Marianne Hagan contributes an appealing turn as the sympathetic Kara Strode, Mitchell Ryan makes for a nice villain as the sinister Dr. Terence Wynn, and the fetching Mariah O'Brien as the brash Beth bares her sweet perky breasts prior to meeting a harsh untimely end. A real disappointment.

    Here's why. Through 4 movies leading up to Curse of Michael Myers, we see him get stabbed, shot, run over, set on fire, blown up, etc. He always comes back stronger than ever though! This film explains that Michael was given special powers by the Cult of Thorn on Halloween night when he was a boy (the opening scene in the original Halloween). Aside from that, it's just another chance to see Michael Myers in action. Pretty weak reasons, I know, but if you love the Halloween franchise, you can't not see this movie...if for anything for the last appearance of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). This film could have been better if it worked on the plot a little better, however. Of course Halloween, like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street was just about squeezing out the dollars...much like the modern Saw films or Paranormal Activity; the idea is to do as many sequels as possible before the franchise completely dries up. Still, this film at least has some connection to the original film unlike Halloween Resurrection or Halloween III. Not that I don't like Halloween III...

    After watching the 5 Halloween films, I heard that there was another film in the franchise and watched it to see if it would satisfy me. Then, I became a bit disappointed, but I don't think this film is as bad as the critics suggested that it was. It's flaws in it's own ways, but it does have some redeeming aspects that save this from getting a lower rating. While some of the actors fell flat, it's great to see Donald Pleasance again as Dr. Loomis (it's sad that he died since this was his last film role) and the new actors including Paul Rudd did fine with their roles. Michael Myers is spooky and scary once again and his make-up never fails to amuse me. The death scenes are both gory and very satisfying especially the part where Jamie Lloyd from Halloweens 4 & 5 died which gave me some chills here and there. The scenery is breathtaking and the directing is above-average. The music is pretty good captures the same suspenseful tone of the previous films very well along with some haunting moments. Now for the flaws. The story is pretty predictable. I liked the concept about the Thorn which was the reason why Michael Myers killed his sister in the original and is well explained, but it suffers from too many plot holes like one scene for example, how the heck did Michael move from one place to another so fast? The script is pretty messy with an abrupt ending that leaves sometime to be desired and the dialog is unbelievably terrible with some unfunny moments. The main protagonists are interesting enough, but most of the characters are flat and are only used at victims to Michael Myers. Even the pacing is a bit sluggish. Overall, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers would've been a much better sequel, but it's not as bad as some say it is. Recommended to those who haven't seen it, but for others, I'd stick to the previous films.

    "Halloween 5" (1989) was a rushed project with a ridiculous story and a stupid ending. It pretty much killed the franchise and it took six years before a new sequel was released. The rights once owned by Transcas Films were bought by Miramax/Dimension (a division of Buena Vista/Disney). The one brave thing this sequel has is that it's trying to explain the mess "Halloween 5" was. But unfortunately, the new story is potentially even dumber than Part 5. According to the movie, it's six years later. Jamie is being held by a cult and gives birth. How can than be, she's what, 14 years old ? We get a new actress, J.C. Brandy (the producers didn't want to pay Danielle Harris the 5000 euro for her return) who looks like she's almost 30 years old. She flees with her newborn baby (according to the producer's cut, Michael is the father (..)) Eitherway, the introduction of the baby is dumb. Michael Myers is not skilled or cunning in this one. For example, he's not able to figure out that Jamie hid her baby in the women's room of a bus station. Even though he's been there chasing her, and after he kills her, he even finds a paper roll of that same restroom in her car. It's a shame Jamie was killed off so quick in the Theatrical Cut, it was as dumb as killing off Rachel right at the beginning of Part 5. Than we're introduced to Tommy Doyle. One of the kids who Laurie Strode babysat in the original "Halloween". He's obsessed with Michael and finds the baby in the bathroom the next morning. Apparently, it's not a popular bathroom since no one has been there that entire time for about 12 hours. Must be because of the massive blood trail Jamie left the night before that no one bothered to clean up. There's also a new family in the old Myers house. They are relatives of the Strode family who adopted Laurie after Michael killed her sister in the original. Besides the father, the family doesn't know that they live in the Myers house. Rather silly when you think about it. Again, it's not the original house they used in the classic, but it's not as silly as the "Old Myers house" in Part 5. The story makes no sense at all, trying to explain why Michael kills. The evil cult thing is awful. The reveal of the mysterious man in black is unbelievable. Remember, he's the one who took out an entire police station like the Terminator at the end of Part 5. Main reason for the messy story is that half the movie was re-shot and re-edited. The Producer's Cut has a way better story but it's still not a very good movie. It has much more scenes with Donald Pleasance and the music is way better. This Theatrical Cut suffers from a lame and incoherent story, very bad editing, unnecessary gore and an unsatisfying ending. Michael Myers is once again played by stuntman George P. Wilbur (he was also Myers in Halloween 4) but here his moves and posture are just not right. He looks more like Jason Voorhees in this one. The cast is not even that bad compared to Part 5. Paul Stephen Rudd (he also starred in "Clueless" that year) plays his part very well, just as Marianne Hagan. Mitchel P. Ryan is underused since he's a great actor and has more potential (Lethal Weapon).It's sad to see that Donald Pleasence's role has almost been reduced to a cameo. He's the only one who held up the "Halloween" franchise. Too bad director Chapelle cut out a lot of his scenes for the the Theatrical Cut. I'v always been a big fan of "Halloween" and horror films in general. The first one remains the best. "Halloween II" (1981) was a very well made sequel that was almost as good as the original. After that, my most favorite "Halloween" is "H20": It was fresh, revived the franchise, had Jamie Lee Curtis and a scary Michael again and went back to the roots of this franchise. "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers" (1988) was a solid entry with great performances by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris. Since that one was a success, a sequel had to be in theaters the next year to compete with Jason and Freddy. Unfortunately, 1989 turned out to be a very bad year for horror: "Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan", "Nightmare 5: The Dream Child" and "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers" had 2 things in common: they all did very poorly at the box office and were among the worst in their franchises. "Halloween 5" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful "Halloween: H20" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.

Apparently there's a producer's cut that makes a lot more sense, but I haven't seen it so let's work with what we've got. In the plus column, Donald Pleasence, in his final film role (he deserved better), produces some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given, and Marianne Hagan is credible as a single mother and the only real character in the middle of all the monotonous deaths. And Paul Rudd has his moments in an early role. That's it for the positive aspects. There are so many things this film bungles, so many ways in which it loses credibility that after half an hour I gave up on it and sighed a lot. Mangling John Carpenter's sinister theme music by turning it into an action cue isn't a good start, but the film is also rife with ineffective false scares and embarrasses itself by referencing 'Rear Window'. Myers again moves around with inhuman speed, but that's the least of the problems when it comes to his actions. How does he string that DJ up in a tree? Why does he put one victim's bloodied clothes in a washing machine? Why does he take the time to hide her body in a tree, and how does he time it so she dangles down at exactly the right time? More questions: why does Hagan's father chop down a For Sale sign with an axe rather than pull it out of the ground? Why does a long, smooth corridor wall have a spike sticking out of it at just the right height to, say, impale a skull? Why does a nurse call security when faced with a desperate man claiming his baby needs medical attention? Why can't Kim Darby navigate through a garden full of obstacles no more dangerous than clothes on a washing line? How does Pleasence recognise the rune, which, if I'm not mistaken, was only previously seen at the end of the abysmal 'Halloween 5'? Does electrocution really make your head explode? And so on and so on and so on. 'Halloween III' remains the best (or should that be least worst) follow up if only because it gave us a break from the Michael Myers stuff, but this is by default the best of the sequels that feature him.

    After the major disappointment of the fifth one, 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' delivers the goods for fans as we find out the motivation behind Michael's killing spree. As you know, 'Halloween 5' ended with Jamie in the police station after some man in black killed all the cops. Well for six years, Jamie has been held against her will by that man and several of his twisted staff. She was also impregnated and now has a newborn baby. Sadly Michael murders, Jamie but could not find what he was really after - her baby boy. Tommy Doyle (the little boy from the first film!) is all grown up now, and still obsessed with what took place that night in 1978. He finds the baby where Jamie hid it from Michael, and spends the film with Kara Strode, her young son Danny and Dr. Loomis trying to keep it safe from the masked killer. I like 'Halloween 6' because it puts a real effort into taking us back to the original. We see Tommy Doyle, the little boy whom Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysat in 1978. We also get introduced to a part of the Strode family, the Strode's of course were the family that adopted Laurie from the Myers'. And the Myers house ACTUALLY resembles the original house, which of course it didn't in the fifth film. George Wilbur makes his return as Michael Myers. He played Michael in 'Halloween 4' and did a great job then, so it was glad to have him back after the underwhelming job Don Shanks did as the killer in part 5. The acting was good all around, in particular from the Strode family characters (Marianne Hagan, Kim Darby and Bradford English). And Donald Pleasence puts in a marvellous performance to end his brilliant career. The real story of this sixth instalment is that we find out WHY Michael has been killing for all of these years. We first saw the Thorn symbol in 'Halloween 5'. Well apparently, Michael was programmed as a child (using this Pagan/Magical Thorn symbol) to kill his family! They give a large explanation on this, but basically when the Thorn symbol appears in the stars on Halloween night each year, it prompts Michael to murder. It explains the method behind Michael's madness. It's a bit far fetched of course, but I liked the efforts to bring a refreshing twist to the story. And it ties all the loose ends we were left with in 'Halloween 5'. Although I liked the idea of Thorn because it brought life to the series, I also view it as a flaw. I think it was far more dark not knowing what was behind Michael's wanting to kill his family. It made him more creepy and insane. Knowing that he was controlled to do what he did for years, only tarnishes his villainous reputation and makes viewers almost sympathize. The gore was good in this, a step up from 'Halloween 5'. And we get some good eerie atmospheric scenes within the streets of Haddonfield. It brings back some genuine scares to the series. Check it out! 6/10

    Michael Myers (hulking George Wilbur) returns once more to Haddonfield, Illinois to resume his killing spree. It's up to troubled Tommy Doyle (well played by Paul Rudd) and Dr. Loomis (a game, but wasted Donald Pleasence, who's given precious little screen time) to stop Myers. Director Joe Chappelle not only crucially fails to develop any suspense or spooky atmosphere, but also goes way overboard with loads of ugly violence and cheap jump-out-at-you fake scares. Worse yet, the wrongheaded script by Daniel Farrands makes a grievous blunder by providing some kind of ridiculous Druid cult back story for Myers, thus completely undermining Myers' status as the embodiment of pure evil as established in the previous films in the series. Moreover, this picture further suffers from a foul mean-spirited tone that hangs heavy over everything like a putrid fog; placing a newborn baby in considerable jeopardy rates as an especially gross and offensive error on the part of the filmmakers. The plodding pace, clumsy use of flash cutting, and a blaring guitar riff during the murders don't help matters any. Ditto the brutal killing of the Jamie Lloyd character and Loomis' lame send-off. On the plus side, Marianne Hagan contributes an appealing turn as the sympathetic Kara Strode, Mitchell Ryan makes for a nice villain as the sinister Dr. Terence Wynn, and the fetching Mariah O'Brien as the brash Beth bares her sweet perky breasts prior to meeting a harsh untimely end. A real disappointment.

    Here's why. Through 4 movies leading up to Curse of Michael Myers, we see him get stabbed, shot, run over, set on fire, blown up, etc. He always comes back stronger than ever though! This film explains that Michael was given special powers by the Cult of Thorn on Halloween night when he was a boy (the opening scene in the original Halloween). Aside from that, it's just another chance to see Michael Myers in action. Pretty weak reasons, I know, but if you love the Halloween franchise, you can't not see this movie...if for anything for the last appearance of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). This film could have been better if it worked on the plot a little better, however. Of course Halloween, like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street was just about squeezing out the dollars...much like the modern Saw films or Paranormal Activity; the idea is to do as many sequels as possible before the franchise completely dries up. Still, this film at least has some connection to the original film unlike Halloween Resurrection or Halloween III. Not that I don't like Halloween III...

    After watching the 5 Halloween films, I heard that there was another film in the franchise and watched it to see if it would satisfy me. Then, I became a bit disappointed, but I don't think this film is as bad as the critics suggested that it was. It's flaws in it's own ways, but it does have some redeeming aspects that save this from getting a lower rating. While some of the actors fell flat, it's great to see Donald Pleasance again as Dr. Loomis (it's sad that he died since this was his last film role) and the new actors including Paul Rudd did fine with their roles. Michael Myers is spooky and scary once again and his make-up never fails to amuse me. The death scenes are both gory and very satisfying especially the part where Jamie Lloyd from Halloweens 4 & 5 died which gave me some chills here and there. The scenery is breathtaking and the directing is above-average. The music is pretty good captures the same suspenseful tone of the previous films very well along with some haunting moments. Now for the flaws. The story is pretty predictable. I liked the concept about the Thorn which was the reason why Michael Myers killed his sister in the original and is well explained, but it suffers from too many plot holes like one scene for example, how the heck did Michael move from one place to another so fast? The script is pretty messy with an abrupt ending that leaves sometime to be desired and the dialog is unbelievably terrible with some unfunny moments. The main protagonists are interesting enough, but most of the characters are flat and are only used at victims to Michael Myers. Even the pacing is a bit sluggish. Overall, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers would've been a much better sequel, but it's not as bad as some say it is. Recommended to those who haven't seen it, but for others, I'd stick to the previous films.

    "Halloween 5" (1989) was a rushed project with a ridiculous story and a stupid ending. It pretty much killed the franchise and it took six years before a new sequel was released. The rights once owned by Transcas Films were bought by Miramax/Dimension (a division of Buena Vista/Disney). The one brave thing this sequel has is that it's trying to explain the mess "Halloween 5" was. But unfortunately, the new story is potentially even dumber than Part 5. According to the movie, it's six years later. Jamie is being held by a cult and gives birth. How can than be, she's what, 14 years old ? We get a new actress, J.C. Brandy (the producers didn't want to pay Danielle Harris the 5000 euro for her return) who looks like she's almost 30 years old. She flees with her newborn baby (according to the producer's cut, Michael is the father (..)) Eitherway, the introduction of the baby is dumb. Michael Myers is not skilled or cunning in this one. For example, he's not able to figure out that Jamie hid her baby in the women's room of a bus station. Even though he's been there chasing her, and after he kills her, he even finds a paper roll of that same restroom in her car. It's a shame Jamie was killed off so quick in the Theatrical Cut, it was as dumb as killing off Rachel right at the beginning of Part 5. Than we're introduced to Tommy Doyle. One of the kids who Laurie Strode babysat in the original "Halloween". He's obsessed with Michael and finds the baby in the bathroom the next morning. Apparently, it's not a popular bathroom since no one has been there that entire time for about 12 hours. Must be because of the massive blood trail Jamie left the night before that no one bothered to clean up. There's also a new family in the old Myers house. They are relatives of the Strode family who adopted Laurie after Michael killed her sister in the original. Besides the father, the family doesn't know that they live in the Myers house. Rather silly when you think about it. Again, it's not the original house they used in the classic, but it's not as silly as the "Old Myers house" in Part 5. The story makes no sense at all, trying to explain why Michael kills. The evil cult thing is awful. The reveal of the mysterious man in black is unbelievable. Remember, he's the one who took out an entire police station like the Terminator at the end of Part 5. Main reason for the messy story is that half the movie was re-shot and re-edited. The Producer's Cut has a way better story but it's still not a very good movie. It has much more scenes with Donald Pleasance and the music is way better. This Theatrical Cut suffers from a lame and incoherent story, very bad editing, unnecessary gore and an unsatisfying ending. Michael Myers is once again played by stuntman George P. Wilbur (he was also Myers in Halloween 4) but here his moves and posture are just not right. He looks more like Jason Voorhees in this one. The cast is not even that bad compared to Part 5. Paul Stephen Rudd (he also starred in "Clueless" that year) plays his part very well, just as Marianne Hagan. Mitchel P. Ryan is underused since he's a great actor and has more potential (Lethal Weapon).It's sad to see that Donald Pleasence's role has almost been reduced to a cameo. He's the only one who held up the "Halloween" franchise. Too bad director Chapelle cut out a lot of his scenes for the the Theatrical Cut. I'v always been a big fan of "Halloween" and horror films in general. The first one remains the best. "Halloween II" (1981) was a very well made sequel that was almost as good as the original. After that, my most favorite "Halloween" is "H20": It was fresh, revived the franchise, had Jamie Lee Curtis and a scary Michael again and went back to the roots of this franchise. "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers" (1988) was a solid entry with great performances by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris. Since that one was a success, a sequel had to be in theaters the next year to compete with Jason and Freddy. Unfortunately, 1989 turned out to be a very bad year for horror: "Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan", "Nightmare 5: The Dream Child" and "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers" had 2 things in common: they all did very poorly at the box office and were among the worst in their franchises. "Halloween 5" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful "Halloween: H20" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.

    The sixth entry in the Halloween franchise picks up some years after the conclusion of Halloween 5. Jamie Lloyd is now a full grown adult, and she's just given birth. Unfortunately for her, Jamie has been kept in the basement of Smith's Grove Sanitarium (the facility that has housed Michael during his stints in and out of custody) by the likes of an underground Druid cult that seeks to somehow restore the once great night of Halloween to its former glory. What that former glory entails is anyone's guess; some gibberish about mayhem, bonfires and star alignments is thrown into the mix, but said references are every bit as vague as they sound. The question you likely have is this: How does Michael Myers fit into all this ridiculousness? Well, as the previous movies have indicated, he's somehow connected to the Druid sacrificial rite, but a lucid explanation of the exact role he plays isyet againconspicuously absent. I suppose it doesn't really matter, though; he's still alive, still angry, and still killing people. Once again he's after the last living remnant of the Myers bloodline, the newborn baby of his aforementioned niece. Oddly enough, Tommy Doyleone of the children from the original Halloween that Laurie babysat "the night he came home"has become obsessed with the persistent rumors about Michael and has rented a room across the street from the Myers house to keep tabs on its residents, one of whom is a kid with the same penchant for murder that Michael himself demonstrated so many years ago. Loomis is back, too. He is, of course, not surprised in the least when Michael reappears in Haddonfield, and the usual hijinks ensue (namely, people don't believe the famed serial killer is still alive, make the mistake of writing him off, and end up getting axed in oh-so-creative ways). The atmosphere generated in the movie is admirable, and this is one of Michael's more menacing outings. Still, one can't help but feel disappointed by the lack of story development, and the movie's conclusion feels much too abrupt. This almost certainly is a direct result of director Joe Chappelle's apparent distaste for Pleasence. According to the Internet Movie Database, Chappelle found many of Pleasence's scenes "boring," and thus engaged in heavy editing in an effort to trim down his presence in the movie. The result is a disjointed affair that's not nearly as effective as it could have been. In short, The Curse of Michael Myers is a convoluted mess that only pretends to answer some of the longstanding questions surrounding the Halloween mythology. The movie has its moments, and the presence of Paul Rudd as the now adult Doyle adds some memorability to the cast of characters.

    Trying to move on with her life, a woman moves back to her hometown unaware of her connection to the Michael Myers bloodline and faces his wrath when he escapes from a sanitarium and resumes his blood-soaked rampage in town. This one here manages to be one of the more enjoyable entries in the series and might very well better than the original. One of the strongest elements for this one derives numerous positive attributes from is the fact that, as a straight Slasher movie, this delivers impeccably. These should feature an imposing killer, which this one has in spades. The creepy mask has never looked better, the more hulking shape to his body is more credible for doling out the more strenuous physical action and the walk is genuinely creepy, a complete stalk and slash attitude, coming relentlessly with no remorse offered to his victims. As well, there's plenty to love about the graphic kills and deaths here, which is one of the best angles here with just a ton of greatness provided with a wide variety of kills delivered with a generous dose of methods, from stabbing to impaling to thrusting into the body and bare-handed, among others, to provide a spectacular array of bloody deaths dished out rather nicely. As well, the fact that this is pretty creepy at times is important as it adds an extra layer to the film with a large quantity of quality suspenseful scenes, from the opening underground escape and bus station stalking to the sneak-attack on the babysitter and the rampage through the hospital, it provides some really chilling moments that work well and give this an outstanding pace. While the story might be give-or-take depending on how you feel it connects to the rest of the series, it's really the only thing wrong here as this is an otherwise outstanding effort. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a brief sex scene.

    I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying. The first film since Dimension (Disney) took over the franchise. The two movies that followed were considerably better H20 and Resurrection were better movies than this.This movie plays with the idea that Michael Myers can be controlled is ludicrous. It plays off the storyline from the last film that the curse came from something astrological, a constellation called thorn if memory serves. This movie lacks real scares. It replaces them with violent shocks. Sadly this would be Donald Pleasance's last appearance as Dr.Loomis.

    Part VI takes place six years after the fifth film ends, with a young woman(said to be Jamie Lloyd, but played by a different actress) escaping the mysterious cult that held her prisoner, along with her baby, with Michael Myers once again in murderous, relentless pursuit. She leaves the baby behind in a bus depot for safety, only to be brutally dispatched by Michael... However, a now grown Tommy Doyle(one of the kids that Laurie Strode babysat from the original) tracks down Doctor Loomis(played for the last time by a sickly Donald Pleasance) to take the baby themselves, leading to a showdown where many shocking revelations will be uncovered... Though well intended by writer Daniel Farrands as a satisfying finale to the series, this entry proved to be an unmitigated disaster, sabotaged by atrocious & shameful rewriting, editing and directing, rendering the film a crass, incoherent mess. Sad to say, Donald Pleasance's last film(he died before it was released).

    After watching the 5 Halloween films, I heard that there was another film in the franchise and watched it to see if it would satisfy me. Then, I became a bit disappointed, but I don't think this film is as bad as the critics suggested that it was. It's flaws in it's own ways, but it does have some redeeming aspects that save this from getting a lower rating. While some of the actors fell flat, it's great to see Donald Pleasance again as Dr. Loomis (it's sad that he died since this was his last film role) and the new actors including Paul Rudd did fine with their roles. Michael Myers is spooky and scary once again and his make-up never fails to amuse me. The death scenes are both gory and very satisfying especially the part where Jamie Lloyd from Halloweens 4 & 5 died which gave me some chills here and there. The scenery is breathtaking and the directing is above-average. The music is pretty good captures the same suspenseful tone of the previous films very well along with some haunting moments. Now for the flaws. The story is pretty predictable. I liked the concept about the Thorn which was the reason why Michael Myers killed his sister in the original and is well explained, but it suffers from too many plot holes like one scene for example, how the heck did Michael move from one place to another so fast? The script is pretty messy with an abrupt ending that leaves sometime to be desired and the dialog is unbelievably terrible with some unfunny moments. The main protagonists are interesting enough, but most of the characters are flat and are only used at victims to Michael Myers. Even the pacing is a bit sluggish. Overall, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers would've been a much better sequel, but it's not as bad as some say it is. Recommended to those who haven't seen it, but for others, I'd stick to the previous films.

    Better than "Haloween 5", but that's not saying very much...

    "Halloween 5" (1989) was a rushed project with a ridiculous story and a stupid ending. It pretty much killed the franchise and it took six years before a new sequel was released. The rights once owned by Transcas Films were bought by Miramax/Dimension (a division of Buena Vista/Disney). The one brave thing this sequel has is that it's trying to explain the mess "Halloween 5" was. But unfortunately, the new story is potentially even dumber than Part 5. According to the movie, it's six years later. Jamie is being held by a cult and gives birth. How can than be, she's what, 14 years old ? We get a new actress, J.C. Brandy (the producers didn't want to pay Danielle Harris the 5000 euro for her return) who looks like she's almost 30 years old. She flees with her newborn baby (according to the producer's cut, Michael is the father (..)) Eitherway, the introduction of the baby is dumb. Michael Myers is not skilled or cunning in this one. For example, he's not able to figure out that Jamie hid her baby in the women's room of a bus station. Even though he's been there chasing her, and after he kills her, he even finds a paper roll of that same restroom in her car. It's a shame Jamie was killed off so quick in the Theatrical Cut, it was as dumb as killing off Rachel right at the beginning of Part 5. Than we're introduced to Tommy Doyle. One of the kids who Laurie Strode babysat in the original "Halloween". He's obsessed with Michael and finds the baby in the bathroom the next morning. Apparently, it's not a popular bathroom since no one has been there that entire time for about 12 hours. Must be because of the massive blood trail Jamie left the night before that no one bothered to clean up. There's also a new family in the old Myers house. They are relatives of the Strode family who adopted Laurie after Michael killed her sister in the original. Besides the father, the family doesn't know that they live in the Myers house. Rather silly when you think about it. Again, it's not the original house they used in the classic, but it's not as silly as the "Old Myers house" in Part 5. The story makes no sense at all, trying to explain why Michael kills. The evil cult thing is awful. The reveal of the mysterious man in black is unbelievable. Remember, he's the one who took out an entire police station like the Terminator at the end of Part 5. Main reason for the messy story is that half the movie was re-shot and re-edited. The Producer's Cut has a way better story but it's still not a very good movie. It has much more scenes with Donald Pleasance and the music is way better. This Theatrical Cut suffers from a lame and incoherent story, very bad editing, unnecessary gore and an unsatisfying ending. Michael Myers is once again played by stuntman George P. Wilbur (he was also Myers in Halloween 4) but here his moves and posture are just not right. He looks more like Jason Voorhees in this one. The cast is not even that bad compared to Part 5. Paul Stephen Rudd (he also starred in "Clueless" that year) plays his part very well, just as Marianne Hagan. Mitchel P. Ryan is underused since he's a great actor and has more potential (Lethal Weapon).It's sad to see that Donald Pleasence's role has almost been reduced to a cameo. He's the only one who held up the "Halloween" franchise. Too bad director Chapelle cut out a lot of his scenes for the the Theatrical Cut. I'v always been a big fan of "Halloween" and horror films in general. The first one remains the best. "Halloween II" (1981) was a very well made sequel that was almost as good as the original. After that, my most favorite "Halloween" is "H20": It was fresh, revived the franchise, had Jamie Lee Curtis and a scary Michael again and went back to the roots of this franchise. "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers" (1988) was a solid entry with great performances by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris. Since that one was a success, a sequel had to be in theaters the next year to compete with Jason and Freddy. Unfortunately, 1989 turned out to be a very bad year for horror: "Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan", "Nightmare 5: The Dream Child" and "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers" had 2 things in common: they all did very poorly at the box office and were among the worst in their franchises. "Halloween 5" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful "Halloween: H20" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.

    The sixth entry in the Halloween franchise picks up some years after the conclusion of Halloween 5. Jamie Lloyd is now a full grown adult, and she's just given birth. Unfortunately for her, Jamie has been kept in the basement of Smith's Grove Sanitarium (the facility that has housed Michael during his stints in and out of custody) by the likes of an underground Druid cult that seeks to somehow restore the once great night of Halloween to its former glory. What that former glory entails is anyone's guess; some gibberish about mayhem, bonfires and star alignments is thrown into the mix, but said references are every bit as vague as they sound. The question you likely have is this: How does Michael Myers fit into all this ridiculousness? Well, as the previous movies have indicated, he's somehow connected to the Druid sacrificial rite, but a lucid explanation of the exact role he plays isyet againconspicuously absent. I suppose it doesn't really matter, though; he's still alive, still angry, and still killing people. Once again he's after the last living remnant of the Myers bloodline, the newborn baby of his aforementioned niece. Oddly enough, Tommy Doyleone of the children from the original Halloween that Laurie babysat "the night he came home"has become obsessed with the persistent rumors about Michael and has rented a room across the street from the Myers house to keep tabs on its residents, one of whom is a kid with the same penchant for murder that Michael himself demonstrated so many years ago. Loomis is back, too. He is, of course, not surprised in the least when Michael reappears in Haddonfield, and the usual hijinks ensue (namely, people don't believe the famed serial killer is still alive, make the mistake of writing him off, and end up getting axed in oh-so-creative ways). The atmosphere generated in the movie is admirable, and this is one of Michael's more menacing outings. Still, one can't help but feel disappointed by the lack of story development, and the movie's conclusion feels much too abrupt. This almost certainly is a direct result of director Joe Chappelle's apparent distaste for Pleasence. According to the Internet Movie Database, Chappelle found many of Pleasence's scenes "boring," and thus engaged in heavy editing in an effort to trim down his presence in the movie. The result is a disjointed affair that's not nearly as effective as it could have been. In short, The Curse of Michael Myers is a convoluted mess that only pretends to answer some of the longstanding questions surrounding the Halloween mythology. The movie has its moments, and the presence of Paul Rudd as the now adult Doyle adds some memorability to the cast of characters.

    Trying to move on with her life, a woman moves back to her hometown unaware of her connection to the Michael Myers bloodline and faces his wrath when he escapes from a sanitarium and resumes his blood-soaked rampage in town. This one here manages to be one of the more enjoyable entries in the series and might very well better than the original. One of the strongest elements for this one derives numerous positive attributes from is the fact that, as a straight Slasher movie, this delivers impeccably. These should feature an imposing killer, which this one has in spades. The creepy mask has never looked better, the more hulking shape to his body is more credible for doling out the more strenuous physical action and the walk is genuinely creepy, a complete stalk and slash attitude, coming relentlessly with no remorse offered to his victims. As well, there's plenty to love about the graphic kills and deaths here, which is one of the best angles here with just a ton of greatness provided with a wide variety of kills delivered with a generous dose of methods, from stabbing to impaling to thrusting into the body and bare-handed, among others, to provide a spectacular array of bloody deaths dished out rather nicely. As well, the fact that this is pretty creepy at times is important as it adds an extra layer to the film with a large quantity of quality suspenseful scenes, from the opening underground escape and bus station stalking to the sneak-attack on the babysitter and the rampage through the hospital, it provides some really chilling moments that work well and give this an outstanding pace. While the story might be give-or-take depending on how you feel it connects to the rest of the series, it's really the only thing wrong here as this is an otherwise outstanding effort. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a brief sex scene.
