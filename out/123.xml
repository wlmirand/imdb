    I remember my older brother showing me this movie when it first came out. I was younger and had a very vivid imagination so it scared the hell out of me. Today I went back and re-watched this movie I have not seen since then and while my imagination is still vivid, I respect the movie now because of it. The movie starts off I would say 80/20 Comedy/Horror. You get to see the shenanigans that MJF and his two ghost cohorts pull off. Watching the transformation of his character as he slowly realizes that he's up against more then he thought. The story develops unbelievably well. The characters (living and dead)are well thought out and brought to life, with such great enthusiasm it's amazing. The story evolves slowly and dramatically, each minute bringing more and more to the story. The acting is amazing. MJF, awesome. Playing both the con artist, and then the hero. Jake Busey pulls of crazy well, but then again he is his fathers son. The CGI I think is pretty awesome for the time. The grim reaper shots, still give me the creeps. Over all I have a love for this movie that makes me want to keep watching it again and again.

    The Frighteners is a fun little movie from the mid-90s. It has an pleasing mix of stars who hit their stride in the 80s (Fox,Wallace, and Ermey) and others who count this as among their first works (Alvarado, Busey, McBride). It is an odd mix of horror and humor from Peter Jackson and had state-of-the-art special effects for the time. The Frighteners, filmed and produced in New Zealand, was the biggest special effects movie made at that time outside the Hollywood movie base. It made extensive use of blue screens and had over 400 computer-enhanced special effects. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wrote the script and Jackson directed and produced the film. The Frighteners has an overall tone of whimsy but also has some impressive horror movie moments. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly. Frank Bannister, played by Fox, is a widowed psychic investigator exploring supernatural goings on in a placid rural town. Newcomer Alvarado plays his romantic interest. Veteran actor John Astin plays a ghost called The Judge who has seen his better days. Ermey plays drill instructor (go figure), Sgt Hiles, who is in charge of the local cemetery. He has several lines and a general demeanor that pays homage or satirizes (depending on your viewpoint) his character in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. Jake Busey plays a good bad man, and McBride plays a funny role as Bannister's ghostly aide. The Frighteners is amusing, frightening, entertaining, and a bit exhausting. It is a great Fall or Halloween movie.

    Accused of murder, a small-town psychic charlatan learns that his skills in dealing with the deceased are put to the test for real when the murder spree continues despite everything he can do to stop it and must keep the spirit from harming his friends. This here turned out to be quite an infuriating and quite troubling if somewhat interesting effort. Most of this is due to the fact that the film is far more of a fantasy effort that a straight-forward horror effort which is strange considering the subject matter at hand. This is mainly found in the finale at the hospital about the subject being sent into a heavenly arena and all the different after-effects on the body being adjusted to life back on Earth, all this just makes for a rather confusing time being that the main purpose is to stop the rampage of the ghostly figure throughout the town that only he can see and believe, so the sudden influx of mystical elements that this does at the very end makes for a confusing time. As well, the fact that these scenes force the film along far longer than it really should as the lengthy running time here really kills this one in that last section, not only with the sudden influx of fantasy but the mindless need to pay off far more plot- threads than it needed. Overall, this really could've used a few minutes shaved off here by deciding to abandon a few of these plots. That said, there's a lot to like here especially the scenes of the hooded ghostly menace in action, most notably the kinetic sequence in the holding cell where the good ghosts go fight the hooded ghost and take the fight between the walls and they good barreling through the different sections of the room as the humans watch and wait for them to appear and disappear, as well as a couple stellar attacks on a moving car that look absolutely amazing, an ambush in a graveyard and finally the hospital confrontation that makes for a lot of fun, so as an action film and horror film it definitely works wonders. As well, the CGI used is actually well-done and doesn't look cheap or fake at all, and gives the ghosts a fluidity that actually comes off nicely and makes up for some of the other flaws. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    Wow! Just watched this movie and what a trip it was!! I can't believe something as lame as Ghostbusters garnered all the attention while this gem was swept aside like the red-headed step-child. So many fantastic characters and twists and turns it made my head spin. I loved everything about this flick including the awesome special effects & the silly humour. Fox shone like he always does and the dude playing the insane FBI agent was brilliant!! Great story, wonderfully directed with great actors and a magic blend of hilarity, scariness, suspense, shocks and spookiness! I read some of the reviews here and can't believe how negative some of them are & the reasons they give for their negativity. eg "Oh boo hoo! It was awful coz the music sounded like some music I heard in another movie" and "Mr Jackson used CGI & expensive cameras and stuff & I don't think he should be allowed to, so I'm going to punish him with lower marks" etc etc Seriously? I think some people just love to be miserable. This is well worth seeing - it's just become one of my favourite movies. And now I just need to find (and buy) the Director's Cut for even more fun!

    This movie only becomes a kind of horror movie towards the end of it. Even then there is humor. I find this to be a rather funny show. Michael J. Fox does his usual fine job of acting, Trini Alvarado is cute as the widowed love interest, John Astin is good as a spirit named the Judge. There are a couple of things that do not hang together though. Why can the spirits go through walls, doors, etc but a vehicle that runs into them carries them along? Why did the murderer spirit's hand pass through Lucy's head and then he could punch her and Frank in the face and bodies? How about that FBI agent? Talk about a whack-a-doodle!! And how about that haircut of his? The sheriff is played by a long character actor Troy Evans. the mouth that roars "R. Lee Emery" appears here as the cemetery control freak sergeant and as usual about all he does is rant and rave.

    This one has received mixed Reviews. It's hard to imagine that anyone could be critical of the imagination that went into this entertaining, if overblown, Movie. It has enough energy and creativity for three Films. But it doesn't know when to quit. It just goes on and on, almost, but not quite, draining the fresh flourishes from the Film. There are Artistic touches that impress and it looks very much like the Cartoony Movies that Jackson had made up to this point. But this may have suffered from too much Zemeckis and too much Money. The Director never needed a lot of Money to make Cool, Off-Beat, and Artistically rewarding Stuff. Just one example, in the opening Scene we see an Evil Entity haunting a Women and it is shown protruding from behind walls and carpets. It is different and diabolical. But it won't be the last time this effect is used. Suffice to say that repetition is the bane of this really good Film. There are Plots on top of Plots and not just in the Cemetery. It could be just a bit too much for some, and yet it is so charming that others may say, give me more.

    Michael J.Fox (in what sadly became his last live-action movie role) is on fine form as troubled con-man,Frank Bannister who has the ability to see ghosts,and uses his unique gift to make money in the small town of Fairwater.He has his ghost "colleagues" haunt the houses of the residents and then offers his services to evict the spooks.It's the perfect scam until more and more healthy people start turning up dead,seemingly from heart attacks,and Frank soon realises that he must use his gift to stop a genuine evil spirit. Starting out like an all-out fantasy comedy,the film brilliantly switches tone around the halfway mark and becomes darker and more violent but director Peter Jackson never stops supplying the laughs either.The twisty plot takes in a host of unforgettable and quirky characters along for the ride.Trini Alvarado plays Lucy,probably the most normal character as a woman who loses her husband and finds herself becoming more involved with Frank and the strange goings on.John Astin,Chi Mcbride,and Jim Fyfe are hilarious as Frank's ghost pals who reluctantly help him out.Most of the film's funniest scenes feature these three characters and Frank's interactions with them.Peter Dobson as Lucy's dead husband Ray also adds a lot of fun into the proceedings.His banter with Fox is brilliant,especially in the scene where he goes to his own funeral.And last but not least is Jeffrey Combs' character, FBI agent Milton Dammers who is one of the weirdest lawmen in movie history.A deeply disturbed individual who has been undercover over the years so many times in different cults, without any therapy, that he has almost become insane himself. I've always loved this film and thought it was underrated and now I've seen the director's cut I love it even more.This version of the film makes the events and characters so much clearer.The mix of genres and the performances combine to fantastic effect in this top-notch film.

    Since his wife's murder, Frank Bannister (Michael J Fox) has made a living as a phony medium, preying on the recently bereaved. Except that Frank really can see ghosts. But when the ghost of a mass murderer returns, intent on continuing his handiwork, Frank's directionless existence must, of necessity, acquire some focus. This comedy horror film is effective as both. It occupies a pivotal place in Peter Jackson's filmography: Bad Taste showed that he could do good things with limited resources, Heavenly Creatures showed that he had some artistic chops, and now The Frighteners showed that he could be trusted with someone else's money to marshall script, effects, and performers into a pleasing end product. Next stop, obviously, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, then and now the biggest logistical and financial production exercise in the history of cinema and, then and now, a major financial and artistic triumph. The Frighteners is much smaller scale, of course, but with its own genre, it is a very successful film - exciting, amusing, suspenseful, and somewhat scary.

    The BEST Peter Jackson film that showcases what he does best: horror and comedy I can remember the scene as if it were yesterday. My older brother, father and 13 year old self hit the movie theater, pumped to see another Michael J. Fox/Zemeckis teaming that we have long since loved since the days of 'Back to the Future'. It's the day after the film opened and the theater was filled with about 10 people (my brother, dad and myself included). The movie rolls and, by the end, I was jumping with how incredibly cool and fun the movie was. And to this day, the same holds true: This is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, if not THE best, and is Jackson's best film to date. I'm sure, by now, you now the premise of the film based on the reviews prior to mine, so I wont bore you with all the babble of what the film is all about. I will, however, give my input as to why this film rocks!!! For one, it has Michael J. Fox. It had been a while since I had seen him in a film (I believe the last one I saw before 'The Frighteners' was 'Life With Mikey') and he was fantastic in this. His portrayal of a ghost hunting con man is a personal favorite of mine. No matter how he acted in the film, whether it was serious or downright goofy, he managed to keep his character extremely likable...as always...and interesting. It seems as though he had a blast with this film. Another reason why this film was so cool was the lack of EXTREME gore that Jackson had used and was known for in his prior films ('Bad Taste', 'Braindead'). Instead, he relied more on story and character development, along with creating some of the best ghost effects ever seen. He did all of this without having to sacrifice a great story with incredibly gory effects. Also, when was the last time you saw a ghost...bleed??? But these aren't the only reasons why you should see this movie. Here are ALL the other reasons why you shouldn't miss this film: -The awesome and strange Jeffrey "Yes I am, I'm an ass****...with a Uzi!" Combs ('Re-Animator') in a GREAT, GREAT...GREAT performance. -The very talented and always sweet Dee Wallace-Stone ('The Howling', 'The Hills Have Eyes') in a very creepy performance. -Another incredibly brilliant, atmospheric and moody score from the great Danny Elfman ('Batman', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'). There were also A lot of great surprises in this film: -R. Lee Ermey ('Full Metal Jacket', 'Willard') in a classic spoof of one of his own characters, from another film. An amazing touch. -John Astin (Gomez, 'The Addams Family' TV show) in a very good performance as the coolest looking ghost of all: A rotting Judge (they don't call him the hanging judge for nothing'). And a surprisingly good Jake Busey ('Starship Troopers') as a serial killer. (You will never see teeth as perfect and as white in another film until you see Jake's when he is killing people. They are very "Looney Tunes"...which was a very nice touch to make his character extra creepy.) All of this, along with a cool, afro-sporting, funky 70's ghost of Chi McBride ('Boston Public'), an underrated Trini Alvarado and not to mention the awesome script, makes this a film that should be on your "TO WATCH RIGHT NOW" list if you haven't seen it already. * If anything, watch this film for the final half, especially when our two heroes enter the old, abandoned Hospital. Some cool, cool stuff. * With the LOTR films, I'm sure there are a lot people who have either seen or have yet to see this film solely because of those fantasy epics, which is sad because this is a wonderful film all by itself. I'm proud to say that I saw this film when it opened, in the theater, and that I have been a fan of this and many of Jackson's earlier (and much better) films for a long time now. I am just as pumped for this new unrated directors cut as I was that day at the movies when I was 13. I'm anxious to see what kind of extra footage is in this version. I'm hoping, like many others, that they will have the complete documentary on this film because that would just be the icing on the cake. All that we fans can do now is wait and watch the calendar for the day this DVD arrives. Visually stunning and atmospheric, very funny, very spooky (at times very serious) but ALWAYS fun, THE FRIGHTENERS has everything you need for a night of great movie watching. NOTE: If you're not a fan of gore, you're in luck. This film has very minimal gore. Yes, there is blood and some gory moments, but for the most part, it's VERY timid compared to Peter Jackson's older films that include some of the goriest scenes in movie history. (i.e. 'Braindead'). It's enough to satisfy all you gore-hounds out there, but not so much that it will turn you non-gore fans away. So if your "dying" to see a great, frighteningly funny and spooky film, check out THE FRIGHTENERS...before your number is up. Because, "When your numbers up...*SNAP*...that's it."

    The basic concept of what Jackson was trying to do with The Frighteners is what originally drew me to the movie (remember, this was back in the day when Jackson himself was relatively unknown). Unlike the Ghostbusters Peter Venkman, who was more than content to dupe people into believing in supernatural, the lead character in The Frighteners fully believes in the existence of the supernatural, even using his own connections with the supernatural world to help convince people they are being haunted. He then goes in and cleans up the haunting, charging exorbitant fees for his services. That subtle difference in a character's motivations really made me interested, especially knowing the lead was being played by Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors. The problem for Fox's Frank Bannister comes when his own con-job comes true, a real haunting is going on by an extremely nasty ghost who's not just haunting, but killing people. Due to his own supernatural powers, Bannister can see who the evil spirit has slated for death, putting him in the awkward position of stopping the spirit and saving the doomed people, even those who have attempted to debunk Bannister's abilities. Michael J. Fox is brilliant in the leading role. Until this point, most of the characters Fox had played were really goody-two-shoes types, from Back to the Future's to "Family Ties". Frank Bannister is a person who is uncomfortable around people due to his supernatural connections. There is nothing overt about Fox's performance that communicates this, it's in the little things: the way he conducts himself around people to his clothes and haircut. At the same time, Bannister isn't quite at home with the ghosts that surround him. Honestly, how comfortable could it be to have a ghostly old-west Judge chasing a ghost dog who's carrying his jawbone around your house? Considering how many of the scenes involved Fox filming to nothing but air (and adding the ghosts in later), his performance is quite amazing. Giving virtual performances is often a trying experience and not everyone can pull it off, but there's no doubt in Fox's performance that the ghost world he can see exists as strongly as the physical world. Fox isn't alone in the performance department though. Jackson filled his spirit world with some spectacular actors, from Fox's "business partners", '70s afro-ed Chi McBride and geeky Jim Fyfe, to the more characterized performances of The Judge (John Astin), the drill sergeant guardian of the graveyard (R. Lee Ermey) and the evil spirit himself, played by Jake Busey in a role that makes him seem a little too much like his old man. Jackson's selections are a far cry from his prior independent film, mostly gained through the advantage of having Robert Zemeckis as the Executive Producer. The Frighteners marks that in-between period of Jackson's career, as he transitioned from a small-time independent horror director to the big budget filmmaker he'd become. This transition means there are some aspects of Jackson's less polished filmmaking involved. Most notably is something that hasn't gone away yet in Jackson's career: his insistence on filming in New Zealand.

    This one has received mixed Reviews. It's hard to imagine that anyone could be critical of the imagination that went into this entertaining, if overblown, Movie. It has enough energy and creativity for three Films. But it doesn't know when to quit. It just goes on and on, almost, but not quite, draining the fresh flourishes from the Film. There are Artistic touches that impress and it looks very much like the Cartoony Movies that Jackson had made up to this point. But this may have suffered from too much Zemeckis and too much Money. The Director never needed a lot of Money to make Cool, Off-Beat, and Artistically rewarding Stuff. Just one example, in the opening Scene we see an Evil Entity haunting a Women and it is shown protruding from behind walls and carpets. It is different and diabolical. But it won't be the last time this effect is used. Suffice to say that repetition is the bane of this really good Film. There are Plots on top of Plots and not just in the Cemetery. It could be just a bit too much for some, and yet it is so charming that others may say, give me more.

    Michael J.Fox (in what sadly became his last live-action movie role) is on fine form as troubled con-man,Frank Bannister who has the ability to see ghosts,and uses his unique gift to make money in the small town of Fairwater.He has his ghost "colleagues" haunt the houses of the residents and then offers his services to evict the spooks.It's the perfect scam until more and more healthy people start turning up dead,seemingly from heart attacks,and Frank soon realises that he must use his gift to stop a genuine evil spirit. Starting out like an all-out fantasy comedy,the film brilliantly switches tone around the halfway mark and becomes darker and more violent but director Peter Jackson never stops supplying the laughs either.The twisty plot takes in a host of unforgettable and quirky characters along for the ride.Trini Alvarado plays Lucy,probably the most normal character as a woman who loses her husband and finds herself becoming more involved with Frank and the strange goings on.John Astin,Chi Mcbride,and Jim Fyfe are hilarious as Frank's ghost pals who reluctantly help him out.Most of the film's funniest scenes feature these three characters and Frank's interactions with them.Peter Dobson as Lucy's dead husband Ray also adds a lot of fun into the proceedings.His banter with Fox is brilliant,especially in the scene where he goes to his own funeral.And last but not least is Jeffrey Combs' character, FBI agent Milton Dammers who is one of the weirdest lawmen in movie history.A deeply disturbed individual who has been undercover over the years so many times in different cults, without any therapy, that he has almost become insane himself. I've always loved this film and thought it was underrated and now I've seen the director's cut I love it even more.This version of the film makes the events and characters so much clearer.The mix of genres and the performances combine to fantastic effect in this top-notch film.

    Since his wife's murder, Frank Bannister (Michael J Fox) has made a living as a phony medium, preying on the recently bereaved. Except that Frank really can see ghosts. But when the ghost of a mass murderer returns, intent on continuing his handiwork, Frank's directionless existence must, of necessity, acquire some focus. This comedy horror film is effective as both. It occupies a pivotal place in Peter Jackson's filmography: Bad Taste showed that he could do good things with limited resources, Heavenly Creatures showed that he had some artistic chops, and now The Frighteners showed that he could be trusted with someone else's money to marshall script, effects, and performers into a pleasing end product. Next stop, obviously, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, then and now the biggest logistical and financial production exercise in the history of cinema and, then and now, a major financial and artistic triumph. The Frighteners is much smaller scale, of course, but with its own genre, it is a very successful film - exciting, amusing, suspenseful, and somewhat scary.

    The BEST Peter Jackson film that showcases what he does best: horror and comedy I can remember the scene as if it were yesterday. My older brother, father and 13 year old self hit the movie theater, pumped to see another Michael J. Fox/Zemeckis teaming that we have long since loved since the days of 'Back to the Future'. It's the day after the film opened and the theater was filled with about 10 people (my brother, dad and myself included). The movie rolls and, by the end, I was jumping with how incredibly cool and fun the movie was. And to this day, the same holds true: This is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, if not THE best, and is Jackson's best film to date. I'm sure, by now, you now the premise of the film based on the reviews prior to mine, so I wont bore you with all the babble of what the film is all about. I will, however, give my input as to why this film rocks!!! For one, it has Michael J. Fox. It had been a while since I had seen him in a film (I believe the last one I saw before 'The Frighteners' was 'Life With Mikey') and he was fantastic in this. His portrayal of a ghost hunting con man is a personal favorite of mine. No matter how he acted in the film, whether it was serious or downright goofy, he managed to keep his character extremely likable...as always...and interesting. It seems as though he had a blast with this film. Another reason why this film was so cool was the lack of EXTREME gore that Jackson had used and was known for in his prior films ('Bad Taste', 'Braindead'). Instead, he relied more on story and character development, along with creating some of the best ghost effects ever seen. He did all of this without having to sacrifice a great story with incredibly gory effects. Also, when was the last time you saw a ghost...bleed??? But these aren't the only reasons why you should see this movie. Here are ALL the other reasons why you shouldn't miss this film: -The awesome and strange Jeffrey "Yes I am, I'm an ass****...with a Uzi!" Combs ('Re-Animator') in a GREAT, GREAT...GREAT performance. -The very talented and always sweet Dee Wallace-Stone ('The Howling', 'The Hills Have Eyes') in a very creepy performance. -Another incredibly brilliant, atmospheric and moody score from the great Danny Elfman ('Batman', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'). There were also A lot of great surprises in this film: -R. Lee Ermey ('Full Metal Jacket', 'Willard') in a classic spoof of one of his own characters, from another film. An amazing touch. -John Astin (Gomez, 'The Addams Family' TV show) in a very good performance as the coolest looking ghost of all: A rotting Judge (they don't call him the hanging judge for nothing'). And a surprisingly good Jake Busey ('Starship Troopers') as a serial killer. (You will never see teeth as perfect and as white in another film until you see Jake's when he is killing people. They are very "Looney Tunes"...which was a very nice touch to make his character extra creepy.) All of this, along with a cool, afro-sporting, funky 70's ghost of Chi McBride ('Boston Public'), an underrated Trini Alvarado and not to mention the awesome script, makes this a film that should be on your "TO WATCH RIGHT NOW" list if you haven't seen it already. * If anything, watch this film for the final half, especially when our two heroes enter the old, abandoned Hospital. Some cool, cool stuff. * With the LOTR films, I'm sure there are a lot people who have either seen or have yet to see this film solely because of those fantasy epics, which is sad because this is a wonderful film all by itself. I'm proud to say that I saw this film when it opened, in the theater, and that I have been a fan of this and many of Jackson's earlier (and much better) films for a long time now. I am just as pumped for this new unrated directors cut as I was that day at the movies when I was 13. I'm anxious to see what kind of extra footage is in this version. I'm hoping, like many others, that they will have the complete documentary on this film because that would just be the icing on the cake. All that we fans can do now is wait and watch the calendar for the day this DVD arrives. Visually stunning and atmospheric, very funny, very spooky (at times very serious) but ALWAYS fun, THE FRIGHTENERS has everything you need for a night of great movie watching. NOTE: If you're not a fan of gore, you're in luck. This film has very minimal gore. Yes, there is blood and some gory moments, but for the most part, it's VERY timid compared to Peter Jackson's older films that include some of the goriest scenes in movie history. (i.e. 'Braindead'). It's enough to satisfy all you gore-hounds out there, but not so much that it will turn you non-gore fans away. So if your "dying" to see a great, frighteningly funny and spooky film, check out THE FRIGHTENERS...before your number is up. Because, "When your numbers up...*SNAP*...that's it."

    The basic concept of what Jackson was trying to do with The Frighteners is what originally drew me to the movie (remember, this was back in the day when Jackson himself was relatively unknown). Unlike the Ghostbusters Peter Venkman, who was more than content to dupe people into believing in supernatural, the lead character in The Frighteners fully believes in the existence of the supernatural, even using his own connections with the supernatural world to help convince people they are being haunted. He then goes in and cleans up the haunting, charging exorbitant fees for his services. That subtle difference in a character's motivations really made me interested, especially knowing the lead was being played by Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors. The problem for Fox's Frank Bannister comes when his own con-job comes true, a real haunting is going on by an extremely nasty ghost who's not just haunting, but killing people. Due to his own supernatural powers, Bannister can see who the evil spirit has slated for death, putting him in the awkward position of stopping the spirit and saving the doomed people, even those who have attempted to debunk Bannister's abilities. Michael J. Fox is brilliant in the leading role. Until this point, most of the characters Fox had played were really goody-two-shoes types, from Back to the Future's to "Family Ties". Frank Bannister is a person who is uncomfortable around people due to his supernatural connections. There is nothing overt about Fox's performance that communicates this, it's in the little things: the way he conducts himself around people to his clothes and haircut. At the same time, Bannister isn't quite at home with the ghosts that surround him. Honestly, how comfortable could it be to have a ghostly old-west Judge chasing a ghost dog who's carrying his jawbone around your house? Considering how many of the scenes involved Fox filming to nothing but air (and adding the ghosts in later), his performance is quite amazing. Giving virtual performances is often a trying experience and not everyone can pull it off, but there's no doubt in Fox's performance that the ghost world he can see exists as strongly as the physical world. Fox isn't alone in the performance department though. Jackson filled his spirit world with some spectacular actors, from Fox's "business partners", '70s afro-ed Chi McBride and geeky Jim Fyfe, to the more characterized performances of The Judge (John Astin), the drill sergeant guardian of the graveyard (R. Lee Ermey) and the evil spirit himself, played by Jake Busey in a role that makes him seem a little too much like his old man. Jackson's selections are a far cry from his prior independent film, mostly gained through the advantage of having Robert Zemeckis as the Executive Producer. The Frighteners marks that in-between period of Jackson's career, as he transitioned from a small-time independent horror director to the big budget filmmaker he'd become. This transition means there are some aspects of Jackson's less polished filmmaking involved. Most notably is something that hasn't gone away yet in Jackson's career: his insistence on filming in New Zealand.

    I remember my older brother showing me this movie when it first came out. I was younger and had a very vivid imagination so it scared the hell out of me. Today I went back and re-watched this movie I have not seen since then and while my imagination is still vivid, I respect the movie now because of it. The movie starts off I would say 80/20 Comedy/Horror. You get to see the shenanigans that MJF and his two ghost cohorts pull off. Watching the transformation of his character as he slowly realizes that he's up against more then he thought. The story develops unbelievably well. The characters (living and dead)are well thought out and brought to life, with such great enthusiasm it's amazing. The story evolves slowly and dramatically, each minute bringing more and more to the story. The acting is amazing. MJF, awesome. Playing both the con artist, and then the hero. Jake Busey pulls of crazy well, but then again he is his fathers son. The CGI I think is pretty awesome for the time. The grim reaper shots, still give me the creeps. Over all I have a love for this movie that makes me want to keep watching it again and again.

    The Frighteners is a fun little movie from the mid-90s. It has an pleasing mix of stars who hit their stride in the 80s (Fox,Wallace, and Ermey) and others who count this as among their first works (Alvarado, Busey, McBride). It is an odd mix of horror and humor from Peter Jackson and had state-of-the-art special effects for the time. The Frighteners, filmed and produced in New Zealand, was the biggest special effects movie made at that time outside the Hollywood movie base. It made extensive use of blue screens and had over 400 computer-enhanced special effects. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wrote the script and Jackson directed and produced the film. The Frighteners has an overall tone of whimsy but also has some impressive horror movie moments. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly. Frank Bannister, played by Fox, is a widowed psychic investigator exploring supernatural goings on in a placid rural town. Newcomer Alvarado plays his romantic interest. Veteran actor John Astin plays a ghost called The Judge who has seen his better days. Ermey plays drill instructor (go figure), Sgt Hiles, who is in charge of the local cemetery. He has several lines and a general demeanor that pays homage or satirizes (depending on your viewpoint) his character in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. Jake Busey plays a good bad man, and McBride plays a funny role as Bannister's ghostly aide. The Frighteners is amusing, frightening, entertaining, and a bit exhausting. It is a great Fall or Halloween movie.

    Accused of murder, a small-town psychic charlatan learns that his skills in dealing with the deceased are put to the test for real when the murder spree continues despite everything he can do to stop it and must keep the spirit from harming his friends. This here turned out to be quite an infuriating and quite troubling if somewhat interesting effort. Most of this is due to the fact that the film is far more of a fantasy effort that a straight-forward horror effort which is strange considering the subject matter at hand. This is mainly found in the finale at the hospital about the subject being sent into a heavenly arena and all the different after-effects on the body being adjusted to life back on Earth, all this just makes for a rather confusing time being that the main purpose is to stop the rampage of the ghostly figure throughout the town that only he can see and believe, so the sudden influx of mystical elements that this does at the very end makes for a confusing time. As well, the fact that these scenes force the film along far longer than it really should as the lengthy running time here really kills this one in that last section, not only with the sudden influx of fantasy but the mindless need to pay off far more plot- threads than it needed. Overall, this really could've used a few minutes shaved off here by deciding to abandon a few of these plots. That said, there's a lot to like here especially the scenes of the hooded ghostly menace in action, most notably the kinetic sequence in the holding cell where the good ghosts go fight the hooded ghost and take the fight between the walls and they good barreling through the different sections of the room as the humans watch and wait for them to appear and disappear, as well as a couple stellar attacks on a moving car that look absolutely amazing, an ambush in a graveyard and finally the hospital confrontation that makes for a lot of fun, so as an action film and horror film it definitely works wonders. As well, the CGI used is actually well-done and doesn't look cheap or fake at all, and gives the ghosts a fluidity that actually comes off nicely and makes up for some of the other flaws. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    Wow! Just watched this movie and what a trip it was!! I can't believe something as lame as Ghostbusters garnered all the attention while this gem was swept aside like the red-headed step-child. So many fantastic characters and twists and turns it made my head spin. I loved everything about this flick including the awesome special effects & the silly humour. Fox shone like he always does and the dude playing the insane FBI agent was brilliant!! Great story, wonderfully directed with great actors and a magic blend of hilarity, scariness, suspense, shocks and spookiness! I read some of the reviews here and can't believe how negative some of them are & the reasons they give for their negativity. eg "Oh boo hoo! It was awful coz the music sounded like some music I heard in another movie" and "Mr Jackson used CGI & expensive cameras and stuff & I don't think he should be allowed to, so I'm going to punish him with lower marks" etc etc Seriously? I think some people just love to be miserable. This is well worth seeing - it's just become one of my favourite movies. And now I just need to find (and buy) the Director's Cut for even more fun!

    This movie only becomes a kind of horror movie towards the end of it. Even then there is humor. I find this to be a rather funny show. Michael J. Fox does his usual fine job of acting, Trini Alvarado is cute as the widowed love interest, John Astin is good as a spirit named the Judge. There are a couple of things that do not hang together though. Why can the spirits go through walls, doors, etc but a vehicle that runs into them carries them along? Why did the murderer spirit's hand pass through Lucy's head and then he could punch her and Frank in the face and bodies? How about that FBI agent? Talk about a whack-a-doodle!! And how about that haircut of his? The sheriff is played by a long character actor Troy Evans. the mouth that roars "R. Lee Emery" appears here as the cemetery control freak sergeant and as usual about all he does is rant and rave.

    The basic concept of what Jackson was trying to do with The Frighteners is what originally drew me to the movie (remember, this was back in the day when Jackson himself was relatively unknown). Unlike the Ghostbusters Peter Venkman, who was more than content to dupe people into believing in supernatural, the lead character in The Frighteners fully believes in the existence of the supernatural, even using his own connections with the supernatural world to help convince people they are being haunted. He then goes in and cleans up the haunting, charging exorbitant fees for his services. That subtle difference in a character's motivations really made me interested, especially knowing the lead was being played by Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors. The problem for Fox's Frank Bannister comes when his own con-job comes true, a real haunting is going on by an extremely nasty ghost who's not just haunting, but killing people. Due to his own supernatural powers, Bannister can see who the evil spirit has slated for death, putting him in the awkward position of stopping the spirit and saving the doomed people, even those who have attempted to debunk Bannister's abilities. Michael J. Fox is brilliant in the leading role. Until this point, most of the characters Fox had played were really goody-two-shoes types, from Back to the Future's to "Family Ties". Frank Bannister is a person who is uncomfortable around people due to his supernatural connections. There is nothing overt about Fox's performance that communicates this, it's in the little things: the way he conducts himself around people to his clothes and haircut. At the same time, Bannister isn't quite at home with the ghosts that surround him. Honestly, how comfortable could it be to have a ghostly old-west Judge chasing a ghost dog who's carrying his jawbone around your house? Considering how many of the scenes involved Fox filming to nothing but air (and adding the ghosts in later), his performance is quite amazing. Giving virtual performances is often a trying experience and not everyone can pull it off, but there's no doubt in Fox's performance that the ghost world he can see exists as strongly as the physical world. Fox isn't alone in the performance department though. Jackson filled his spirit world with some spectacular actors, from Fox's "business partners", '70s afro-ed Chi McBride and geeky Jim Fyfe, to the more characterized performances of The Judge (John Astin), the drill sergeant guardian of the graveyard (R. Lee Ermey) and the evil spirit himself, played by Jake Busey in a role that makes him seem a little too much like his old man. Jackson's selections are a far cry from his prior independent film, mostly gained through the advantage of having Robert Zemeckis as the Executive Producer. The Frighteners marks that in-between period of Jackson's career, as he transitioned from a small-time independent horror director to the big budget filmmaker he'd become. This transition means there are some aspects of Jackson's less polished filmmaking involved. Most notably is something that hasn't gone away yet in Jackson's career: his insistence on filming in New Zealand.

    I remember my older brother showing me this movie when it first came out. I was younger and had a very vivid imagination so it scared the hell out of me. Today I went back and re-watched this movie I have not seen since then and while my imagination is still vivid, I respect the movie now because of it. The movie starts off I would say 80/20 Comedy/Horror. You get to see the shenanigans that MJF and his two ghost cohorts pull off. Watching the transformation of his character as he slowly realizes that he's up against more then he thought. The story develops unbelievably well. The characters (living and dead)are well thought out and brought to life, with such great enthusiasm it's amazing. The story evolves slowly and dramatically, each minute bringing more and more to the story. The acting is amazing. MJF, awesome. Playing both the con artist, and then the hero. Jake Busey pulls of crazy well, but then again he is his fathers son. The CGI I think is pretty awesome for the time. The grim reaper shots, still give me the creeps. Over all I have a love for this movie that makes me want to keep watching it again and again.

    The Frighteners is a fun little movie from the mid-90s. It has an pleasing mix of stars who hit their stride in the 80s (Fox,Wallace, and Ermey) and others who count this as among their first works (Alvarado, Busey, McBride). It is an odd mix of horror and humor from Peter Jackson and had state-of-the-art special effects for the time. The Frighteners, filmed and produced in New Zealand, was the biggest special effects movie made at that time outside the Hollywood movie base. It made extensive use of blue screens and had over 400 computer-enhanced special effects. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wrote the script and Jackson directed and produced the film. The Frighteners has an overall tone of whimsy but also has some impressive horror movie moments. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly. Frank Bannister, played by Fox, is a widowed psychic investigator exploring supernatural goings on in a placid rural town. Newcomer Alvarado plays his romantic interest. Veteran actor John Astin plays a ghost called The Judge who has seen his better days. Ermey plays drill instructor (go figure), Sgt Hiles, who is in charge of the local cemetery. He has several lines and a general demeanor that pays homage or satirizes (depending on your viewpoint) his character in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. Jake Busey plays a good bad man, and McBride plays a funny role as Bannister's ghostly aide. The Frighteners is amusing, frightening, entertaining, and a bit exhausting. It is a great Fall or Halloween movie.

    Accused of murder, a small-town psychic charlatan learns that his skills in dealing with the deceased are put to the test for real when the murder spree continues despite everything he can do to stop it and must keep the spirit from harming his friends. This here turned out to be quite an infuriating and quite troubling if somewhat interesting effort. Most of this is due to the fact that the film is far more of a fantasy effort that a straight-forward horror effort which is strange considering the subject matter at hand. This is mainly found in the finale at the hospital about the subject being sent into a heavenly arena and all the different after-effects on the body being adjusted to life back on Earth, all this just makes for a rather confusing time being that the main purpose is to stop the rampage of the ghostly figure throughout the town that only he can see and believe, so the sudden influx of mystical elements that this does at the very end makes for a confusing time. As well, the fact that these scenes force the film along far longer than it really should as the lengthy running time here really kills this one in that last section, not only with the sudden influx of fantasy but the mindless need to pay off far more plot- threads than it needed. Overall, this really could've used a few minutes shaved off here by deciding to abandon a few of these plots. That said, there's a lot to like here especially the scenes of the hooded ghostly menace in action, most notably the kinetic sequence in the holding cell where the good ghosts go fight the hooded ghost and take the fight between the walls and they good barreling through the different sections of the room as the humans watch and wait for them to appear and disappear, as well as a couple stellar attacks on a moving car that look absolutely amazing, an ambush in a graveyard and finally the hospital confrontation that makes for a lot of fun, so as an action film and horror film it definitely works wonders. As well, the CGI used is actually well-done and doesn't look cheap or fake at all, and gives the ghosts a fluidity that actually comes off nicely and makes up for some of the other flaws. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    Wow! Just watched this movie and what a trip it was!! I can't believe something as lame as Ghostbusters garnered all the attention while this gem was swept aside like the red-headed step-child. So many fantastic characters and twists and turns it made my head spin. I loved everything about this flick including the awesome special effects & the silly humour. Fox shone like he always does and the dude playing the insane FBI agent was brilliant!! Great story, wonderfully directed with great actors and a magic blend of hilarity, scariness, suspense, shocks and spookiness! I read some of the reviews here and can't believe how negative some of them are & the reasons they give for their negativity. eg "Oh boo hoo! It was awful coz the music sounded like some music I heard in another movie" and "Mr Jackson used CGI & expensive cameras and stuff & I don't think he should be allowed to, so I'm going to punish him with lower marks" etc etc Seriously? I think some people just love to be miserable. This is well worth seeing - it's just become one of my favourite movies. And now I just need to find (and buy) the Director's Cut for even more fun!

    This movie only becomes a kind of horror movie towards the end of it. Even then there is humor. I find this to be a rather funny show. Michael J. Fox does his usual fine job of acting, Trini Alvarado is cute as the widowed love interest, John Astin is good as a spirit named the Judge. There are a couple of things that do not hang together though. Why can the spirits go through walls, doors, etc but a vehicle that runs into them carries them along? Why did the murderer spirit's hand pass through Lucy's head and then he could punch her and Frank in the face and bodies? How about that FBI agent? Talk about a whack-a-doodle!! And how about that haircut of his? The sheriff is played by a long character actor Troy Evans. the mouth that roars "R. Lee Emery" appears here as the cemetery control freak sergeant and as usual about all he does is rant and rave.

    This one has received mixed Reviews. It's hard to imagine that anyone could be critical of the imagination that went into this entertaining, if overblown, Movie. It has enough energy and creativity for three Films. But it doesn't know when to quit. It just goes on and on, almost, but not quite, draining the fresh flourishes from the Film. There are Artistic touches that impress and it looks very much like the Cartoony Movies that Jackson had made up to this point. But this may have suffered from too much Zemeckis and too much Money. The Director never needed a lot of Money to make Cool, Off-Beat, and Artistically rewarding Stuff. Just one example, in the opening Scene we see an Evil Entity haunting a Women and it is shown protruding from behind walls and carpets. It is different and diabolical. But it won't be the last time this effect is used. Suffice to say that repetition is the bane of this really good Film. There are Plots on top of Plots and not just in the Cemetery. It could be just a bit too much for some, and yet it is so charming that others may say, give me more.

    Michael J.Fox (in what sadly became his last live-action movie role) is on fine form as troubled con-man,Frank Bannister who has the ability to see ghosts,and uses his unique gift to make money in the small town of Fairwater.He has his ghost "colleagues" haunt the houses of the residents and then offers his services to evict the spooks.It's the perfect scam until more and more healthy people start turning up dead,seemingly from heart attacks,and Frank soon realises that he must use his gift to stop a genuine evil spirit. Starting out like an all-out fantasy comedy,the film brilliantly switches tone around the halfway mark and becomes darker and more violent but director Peter Jackson never stops supplying the laughs either.The twisty plot takes in a host of unforgettable and quirky characters along for the ride.Trini Alvarado plays Lucy,probably the most normal character as a woman who loses her husband and finds herself becoming more involved with Frank and the strange goings on.John Astin,Chi Mcbride,and Jim Fyfe are hilarious as Frank's ghost pals who reluctantly help him out.Most of the film's funniest scenes feature these three characters and Frank's interactions with them.Peter Dobson as Lucy's dead husband Ray also adds a lot of fun into the proceedings.His banter with Fox is brilliant,especially in the scene where he goes to his own funeral.And last but not least is Jeffrey Combs' character, FBI agent Milton Dammers who is one of the weirdest lawmen in movie history.A deeply disturbed individual who has been undercover over the years so many times in different cults, without any therapy, that he has almost become insane himself. I've always loved this film and thought it was underrated and now I've seen the director's cut I love it even more.This version of the film makes the events and characters so much clearer.The mix of genres and the performances combine to fantastic effect in this top-notch film.

    Since his wife's murder, Frank Bannister (Michael J Fox) has made a living as a phony medium, preying on the recently bereaved. Except that Frank really can see ghosts. But when the ghost of a mass murderer returns, intent on continuing his handiwork, Frank's directionless existence must, of necessity, acquire some focus. This comedy horror film is effective as both. It occupies a pivotal place in Peter Jackson's filmography: Bad Taste showed that he could do good things with limited resources, Heavenly Creatures showed that he had some artistic chops, and now The Frighteners showed that he could be trusted with someone else's money to marshall script, effects, and performers into a pleasing end product. Next stop, obviously, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, then and now the biggest logistical and financial production exercise in the history of cinema and, then and now, a major financial and artistic triumph. The Frighteners is much smaller scale, of course, but with its own genre, it is a very successful film - exciting, amusing, suspenseful, and somewhat scary.

    The BEST Peter Jackson film that showcases what he does best: horror and comedy I can remember the scene as if it were yesterday. My older brother, father and 13 year old self hit the movie theater, pumped to see another Michael J. Fox/Zemeckis teaming that we have long since loved since the days of 'Back to the Future'. It's the day after the film opened and the theater was filled with about 10 people (my brother, dad and myself included). The movie rolls and, by the end, I was jumping with how incredibly cool and fun the movie was. And to this day, the same holds true: This is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, if not THE best, and is Jackson's best film to date. I'm sure, by now, you now the premise of the film based on the reviews prior to mine, so I wont bore you with all the babble of what the film is all about. I will, however, give my input as to why this film rocks!!! For one, it has Michael J. Fox. It had been a while since I had seen him in a film (I believe the last one I saw before 'The Frighteners' was 'Life With Mikey') and he was fantastic in this. His portrayal of a ghost hunting con man is a personal favorite of mine. No matter how he acted in the film, whether it was serious or downright goofy, he managed to keep his character extremely likable...as always...and interesting. It seems as though he had a blast with this film. Another reason why this film was so cool was the lack of EXTREME gore that Jackson had used and was known for in his prior films ('Bad Taste', 'Braindead'). Instead, he relied more on story and character development, along with creating some of the best ghost effects ever seen. He did all of this without having to sacrifice a great story with incredibly gory effects. Also, when was the last time you saw a ghost...bleed??? But these aren't the only reasons why you should see this movie. Here are ALL the other reasons why you shouldn't miss this film: -The awesome and strange Jeffrey "Yes I am, I'm an ass****...with a Uzi!" Combs ('Re-Animator') in a GREAT, GREAT...GREAT performance. -The very talented and always sweet Dee Wallace-Stone ('The Howling', 'The Hills Have Eyes') in a very creepy performance. -Another incredibly brilliant, atmospheric and moody score from the great Danny Elfman ('Batman', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'). There were also A lot of great surprises in this film: -R. Lee Ermey ('Full Metal Jacket', 'Willard') in a classic spoof of one of his own characters, from another film. An amazing touch. -John Astin (Gomez, 'The Addams Family' TV show) in a very good performance as the coolest looking ghost of all: A rotting Judge (they don't call him the hanging judge for nothing'). And a surprisingly good Jake Busey ('Starship Troopers') as a serial killer. (You will never see teeth as perfect and as white in another film until you see Jake's when he is killing people. They are very "Looney Tunes"...which was a very nice touch to make his character extra creepy.) All of this, along with a cool, afro-sporting, funky 70's ghost of Chi McBride ('Boston Public'), an underrated Trini Alvarado and not to mention the awesome script, makes this a film that should be on your "TO WATCH RIGHT NOW" list if you haven't seen it already. * If anything, watch this film for the final half, especially when our two heroes enter the old, abandoned Hospital. Some cool, cool stuff. * With the LOTR films, I'm sure there are a lot people who have either seen or have yet to see this film solely because of those fantasy epics, which is sad because this is a wonderful film all by itself. I'm proud to say that I saw this film when it opened, in the theater, and that I have been a fan of this and many of Jackson's earlier (and much better) films for a long time now. I am just as pumped for this new unrated directors cut as I was that day at the movies when I was 13. I'm anxious to see what kind of extra footage is in this version. I'm hoping, like many others, that they will have the complete documentary on this film because that would just be the icing on the cake. All that we fans can do now is wait and watch the calendar for the day this DVD arrives. Visually stunning and atmospheric, very funny, very spooky (at times very serious) but ALWAYS fun, THE FRIGHTENERS has everything you need for a night of great movie watching. NOTE: If you're not a fan of gore, you're in luck. This film has very minimal gore. Yes, there is blood and some gory moments, but for the most part, it's VERY timid compared to Peter Jackson's older films that include some of the goriest scenes in movie history. (i.e. 'Braindead'). It's enough to satisfy all you gore-hounds out there, but not so much that it will turn you non-gore fans away. So if your "dying" to see a great, frighteningly funny and spooky film, check out THE FRIGHTENERS...before your number is up. Because, "When your numbers up...*SNAP*...that's it."

There are a couple of things that do not hang together though. Why can the spirits go through walls, doors, etc but a vehicle that runs into them carries them along? Why did the murderer spirit's hand pass through Lucy's head and then he could punch her and Frank in the face and bodies? How about that FBI agent? Talk about a whack-a-doodle!! And how about that haircut of his? The sheriff is played by a long character actor Troy Evans. the mouth that roars "R. Lee Emery" appears here as the cemetery control freak sergeant and as usual about all he does is rant and rave.

    This one has received mixed Reviews. It's hard to imagine that anyone could be critical of the imagination that went into this entertaining, if overblown, Movie. It has enough energy and creativity for three Films. But it doesn't know when to quit. It just goes on and on, almost, but not quite, draining the fresh flourishes from the Film. There are Artistic touches that impress and it looks very much like the Cartoony Movies that Jackson had made up to this point. But this may have suffered from too much Zemeckis and too much Money. The Director never needed a lot of Money to make Cool, Off-Beat, and Artistically rewarding Stuff. Just one example, in the opening Scene we see an Evil Entity haunting a Women and it is shown protruding from behind walls and carpets. It is different and diabolical. But it won't be the last time this effect is used. Suffice to say that repetition is the bane of this really good Film. There are Plots on top of Plots and not just in the Cemetery. It could be just a bit too much for some, and yet it is so charming that others may say, give me more.

    Michael J.Fox (in what sadly became his last live-action movie role) is on fine form as troubled con-man,Frank Bannister who has the ability to see ghosts,and uses his unique gift to make money in the small town of Fairwater.He has his ghost "colleagues" haunt the houses of the residents and then offers his services to evict the spooks.It's the perfect scam until more and more healthy people start turning up dead,seemingly from heart attacks,and Frank soon realises that he must use his gift to stop a genuine evil spirit. Starting out like an all-out fantasy comedy,the film brilliantly switches tone around the halfway mark and becomes darker and more violent but director Peter Jackson never stops supplying the laughs either.The twisty plot takes in a host of unforgettable and quirky characters along for the ride.Trini Alvarado plays Lucy,probably the most normal character as a woman who loses her husband and finds herself becoming more involved with Frank and the strange goings on.John Astin,Chi Mcbride,and Jim Fyfe are hilarious as Frank's ghost pals who reluctantly help him out.Most of the film's funniest scenes feature these three characters and Frank's interactions with them.Peter Dobson as Lucy's dead husband Ray also adds a lot of fun into the proceedings.His banter with Fox is brilliant,especially in the scene where he goes to his own funeral.And last but not least is Jeffrey Combs' character, FBI agent Milton Dammers who is one of the weirdest lawmen in movie history.A deeply disturbed individual who has been undercover over the years so many times in different cults, without any therapy, that he has almost become insane himself. I've always loved this film and thought it was underrated and now I've seen the director's cut I love it even more.This version of the film makes the events and characters so much clearer.The mix of genres and the performances combine to fantastic effect in this top-notch film.

    Since his wife's murder, Frank Bannister (Michael J Fox) has made a living as a phony medium, preying on the recently bereaved. Except that Frank really can see ghosts. But when the ghost of a mass murderer returns, intent on continuing his handiwork, Frank's directionless existence must, of necessity, acquire some focus. This comedy horror film is effective as both. It occupies a pivotal place in Peter Jackson's filmography: Bad Taste showed that he could do good things with limited resources, Heavenly Creatures showed that he had some artistic chops, and now The Frighteners showed that he could be trusted with someone else's money to marshall script, effects, and performers into a pleasing end product. Next stop, obviously, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, then and now the biggest logistical and financial production exercise in the history of cinema and, then and now, a major financial and artistic triumph. The Frighteners is much smaller scale, of course, but with its own genre, it is a very successful film - exciting, amusing, suspenseful, and somewhat scary.

    The BEST Peter Jackson film that showcases what he does best: horror and comedy I can remember the scene as if it were yesterday. My older brother, father and 13 year old self hit the movie theater, pumped to see another Michael J. Fox/Zemeckis teaming that we have long since loved since the days of 'Back to the Future'. It's the day after the film opened and the theater was filled with about 10 people (my brother, dad and myself included). The movie rolls and, by the end, I was jumping with how incredibly cool and fun the movie was. And to this day, the same holds true: This is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, if not THE best, and is Jackson's best film to date. I'm sure, by now, you now the premise of the film based on the reviews prior to mine, so I wont bore you with all the babble of what the film is all about. I will, however, give my input as to why this film rocks!!! For one, it has Michael J. Fox. It had been a while since I had seen him in a film (I believe the last one I saw before 'The Frighteners' was 'Life With Mikey') and he was fantastic in this. His portrayal of a ghost hunting con man is a personal favorite of mine. No matter how he acted in the film, whether it was serious or downright goofy, he managed to keep his character extremely likable...as always...and interesting. It seems as though he had a blast with this film. Another reason why this film was so cool was the lack of EXTREME gore that Jackson had used and was known for in his prior films ('Bad Taste', 'Braindead'). Instead, he relied more on story and character development, along with creating some of the best ghost effects ever seen. He did all of this without having to sacrifice a great story with incredibly gory effects. Also, when was the last time you saw a ghost...bleed??? But these aren't the only reasons why you should see this movie. Here are ALL the other reasons why you shouldn't miss this film: -The awesome and strange Jeffrey "Yes I am, I'm an ass****...with a Uzi!" Combs ('Re-Animator') in a GREAT, GREAT...GREAT performance. -The very talented and always sweet Dee Wallace-Stone ('The Howling', 'The Hills Have Eyes') in a very creepy performance. -Another incredibly brilliant, atmospheric and moody score from the great Danny Elfman ('Batman', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'). There were also A lot of great surprises in this film: -R. Lee Ermey ('Full Metal Jacket', 'Willard') in a classic spoof of one of his own characters, from another film. An amazing touch. -John Astin (Gomez, 'The Addams Family' TV show) in a very good performance as the coolest looking ghost of all: A rotting Judge (they don't call him the hanging judge for nothing'). And a surprisingly good Jake Busey ('Starship Troopers') as a serial killer. (You will never see teeth as perfect and as white in another film until you see Jake's when he is killing people. They are very "Looney Tunes"...which was a very nice touch to make his character extra creepy.) All of this, along with a cool, afro-sporting, funky 70's ghost of Chi McBride ('Boston Public'), an underrated Trini Alvarado and not to mention the awesome script, makes this a film that should be on your "TO WATCH RIGHT NOW" list if you haven't seen it already. * If anything, watch this film for the final half, especially when our two heroes enter the old, abandoned Hospital. Some cool, cool stuff. * With the LOTR films, I'm sure there are a lot people who have either seen or have yet to see this film solely because of those fantasy epics, which is sad because this is a wonderful film all by itself. I'm proud to say that I saw this film when it opened, in the theater, and that I have been a fan of this and many of Jackson's earlier (and much better) films for a long time now. I am just as pumped for this new unrated directors cut as I was that day at the movies when I was 13. I'm anxious to see what kind of extra footage is in this version. I'm hoping, like many others, that they will have the complete documentary on this film because that would just be the icing on the cake. All that we fans can do now is wait and watch the calendar for the day this DVD arrives. Visually stunning and atmospheric, very funny, very spooky (at times very serious) but ALWAYS fun, THE FRIGHTENERS has everything you need for a night of great movie watching. NOTE: If you're not a fan of gore, you're in luck. This film has very minimal gore. Yes, there is blood and some gory moments, but for the most part, it's VERY timid compared to Peter Jackson's older films that include some of the goriest scenes in movie history. (i.e. 'Braindead'). It's enough to satisfy all you gore-hounds out there, but not so much that it will turn you non-gore fans away. So if your "dying" to see a great, frighteningly funny and spooky film, check out THE FRIGHTENERS...before your number is up. Because, "When your numbers up...*SNAP*...that's it."

    The basic concept of what Jackson was trying to do with The Frighteners is what originally drew me to the movie (remember, this was back in the day when Jackson himself was relatively unknown). Unlike the Ghostbusters Peter Venkman, who was more than content to dupe people into believing in supernatural, the lead character in The Frighteners fully believes in the existence of the supernatural, even using his own connections with the supernatural world to help convince people they are being haunted. He then goes in and cleans up the haunting, charging exorbitant fees for his services. That subtle difference in a character's motivations really made me interested, especially knowing the lead was being played by Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors. The problem for Fox's Frank Bannister comes when his own con-job comes true, a real haunting is going on by an extremely nasty ghost who's not just haunting, but killing people. Due to his own supernatural powers, Bannister can see who the evil spirit has slated for death, putting him in the awkward position of stopping the spirit and saving the doomed people, even those who have attempted to debunk Bannister's abilities. Michael J. Fox is brilliant in the leading role. Until this point, most of the characters Fox had played were really goody-two-shoes types, from Back to the Future's to "Family Ties". Frank Bannister is a person who is uncomfortable around people due to his supernatural connections. There is nothing overt about Fox's performance that communicates this, it's in the little things: the way he conducts himself around people to his clothes and haircut. At the same time, Bannister isn't quite at home with the ghosts that surround him. Honestly, how comfortable could it be to have a ghostly old-west Judge chasing a ghost dog who's carrying his jawbone around your house? Considering how many of the scenes involved Fox filming to nothing but air (and adding the ghosts in later), his performance is quite amazing. Giving virtual performances is often a trying experience and not everyone can pull it off, but there's no doubt in Fox's performance that the ghost world he can see exists as strongly as the physical world. Fox isn't alone in the performance department though. Jackson filled his spirit world with some spectacular actors, from Fox's "business partners", '70s afro-ed Chi McBride and geeky Jim Fyfe, to the more characterized performances of The Judge (John Astin), the drill sergeant guardian of the graveyard (R. Lee Ermey) and the evil spirit himself, played by Jake Busey in a role that makes him seem a little too much like his old man. Jackson's selections are a far cry from his prior independent film, mostly gained through the advantage of having Robert Zemeckis as the Executive Producer. The Frighteners marks that in-between period of Jackson's career, as he transitioned from a small-time independent horror director to the big budget filmmaker he'd become. This transition means there are some aspects of Jackson's less polished filmmaking involved. Most notably is something that hasn't gone away yet in Jackson's career: his insistence on filming in New Zealand.

    I remember my older brother showing me this movie when it first came out. I was younger and had a very vivid imagination so it scared the hell out of me. Today I went back and re-watched this movie I have not seen since then and while my imagination is still vivid, I respect the movie now because of it. The movie starts off I would say 80/20 Comedy/Horror. You get to see the shenanigans that MJF and his two ghost cohorts pull off. Watching the transformation of his character as he slowly realizes that he's up against more then he thought. The story develops unbelievably well. The characters (living and dead)are well thought out and brought to life, with such great enthusiasm it's amazing. The story evolves slowly and dramatically, each minute bringing more and more to the story. The acting is amazing. MJF, awesome. Playing both the con artist, and then the hero. Jake Busey pulls of crazy well, but then again he is his fathers son. The CGI I think is pretty awesome for the time. The grim reaper shots, still give me the creeps. Over all I have a love for this movie that makes me want to keep watching it again and again.

    The Frighteners is a fun little movie from the mid-90s. It has an pleasing mix of stars who hit their stride in the 80s (Fox,Wallace, and Ermey) and others who count this as among their first works (Alvarado, Busey, McBride). It is an odd mix of horror and humor from Peter Jackson and had state-of-the-art special effects for the time. The Frighteners, filmed and produced in New Zealand, was the biggest special effects movie made at that time outside the Hollywood movie base. It made extensive use of blue screens and had over 400 computer-enhanced special effects. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wrote the script and Jackson directed and produced the film. The Frighteners has an overall tone of whimsy but also has some impressive horror movie moments. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly. Frank Bannister, played by Fox, is a widowed psychic investigator exploring supernatural goings on in a placid rural town. Newcomer Alvarado plays his romantic interest. Veteran actor John Astin plays a ghost called The Judge who has seen his better days. Ermey plays drill instructor (go figure), Sgt Hiles, who is in charge of the local cemetery. He has several lines and a general demeanor that pays homage or satirizes (depending on your viewpoint) his character in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. Jake Busey plays a good bad man, and McBride plays a funny role as Bannister's ghostly aide. The Frighteners is amusing, frightening, entertaining, and a bit exhausting. It is a great Fall or Halloween movie.

    Accused of murder, a small-town psychic charlatan learns that his skills in dealing with the deceased are put to the test for real when the murder spree continues despite everything he can do to stop it and must keep the spirit from harming his friends. This here turned out to be quite an infuriating and quite troubling if somewhat interesting effort. Most of this is due to the fact that the film is far more of a fantasy effort that a straight-forward horror effort which is strange considering the subject matter at hand. This is mainly found in the finale at the hospital about the subject being sent into a heavenly arena and all the different after-effects on the body being adjusted to life back on Earth, all this just makes for a rather confusing time being that the main purpose is to stop the rampage of the ghostly figure throughout the town that only he can see and believe, so the sudden influx of mystical elements that this does at the very end makes for a confusing time. As well, the fact that these scenes force the film along far longer than it really should as the lengthy running time here really kills this one in that last section, not only with the sudden influx of fantasy but the mindless need to pay off far more plot- threads than it needed. Overall, this really could've used a few minutes shaved off here by deciding to abandon a few of these plots. That said, there's a lot to like here especially the scenes of the hooded ghostly menace in action, most notably the kinetic sequence in the holding cell where the good ghosts go fight the hooded ghost and take the fight between the walls and they good barreling through the different sections of the room as the humans watch and wait for them to appear and disappear, as well as a couple stellar attacks on a moving car that look absolutely amazing, an ambush in a graveyard and finally the hospital confrontation that makes for a lot of fun, so as an action film and horror film it definitely works wonders. As well, the CGI used is actually well-done and doesn't look cheap or fake at all, and gives the ghosts a fluidity that actually comes off nicely and makes up for some of the other flaws. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    Wow! Just watched this movie and what a trip it was!! I can't believe something as lame as Ghostbusters garnered all the attention while this gem was swept aside like the red-headed step-child. So many fantastic characters and twists and turns it made my head spin. I loved everything about this flick including the awesome special effects & the silly humour. Fox shone like he always does and the dude playing the insane FBI agent was brilliant!! Great story, wonderfully directed with great actors and a magic blend of hilarity, scariness, suspense, shocks and spookiness! I read some of the reviews here and can't believe how negative some of them are & the reasons they give for their negativity. eg "Oh boo hoo! It was awful coz the music sounded like some music I heard in another movie" and "Mr Jackson used CGI & expensive cameras and stuff & I don't think he should be allowed to, so I'm going to punish him with lower marks" etc etc Seriously? I think some people just love to be miserable. This is well worth seeing - it's just become one of my favourite movies. And now I just need to find (and buy) the Director's Cut for even more fun!

It's enough to satisfy all you gore-hounds out there, but not so much that it will turn you non-gore fans away. So if your "dying" to see a great, frighteningly funny and spooky film, check out THE FRIGHTENERS...before your number is up. Because, "When your numbers up...*SNAP*...that's it."

    The basic concept of what Jackson was trying to do with The Frighteners is what originally drew me to the movie (remember, this was back in the day when Jackson himself was relatively unknown). Unlike the Ghostbusters Peter Venkman, who was more than content to dupe people into believing in supernatural, the lead character in The Frighteners fully believes in the existence of the supernatural, even using his own connections with the supernatural world to help convince people they are being haunted. He then goes in and cleans up the haunting, charging exorbitant fees for his services. That subtle difference in a character's motivations really made me interested, especially knowing the lead was being played by Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors. The problem for Fox's Frank Bannister comes when his own con-job comes true, a real haunting is going on by an extremely nasty ghost who's not just haunting, but killing people. Due to his own supernatural powers, Bannister can see who the evil spirit has slated for death, putting him in the awkward position of stopping the spirit and saving the doomed people, even those who have attempted to debunk Bannister's abilities. Michael J. Fox is brilliant in the leading role. Until this point, most of the characters Fox had played were really goody-two-shoes types, from Back to the Future's to "Family Ties". Frank Bannister is a person who is uncomfortable around people due to his supernatural connections. There is nothing overt about Fox's performance that communicates this, it's in the little things: the way he conducts himself around people to his clothes and haircut. At the same time, Bannister isn't quite at home with the ghosts that surround him. Honestly, how comfortable could it be to have a ghostly old-west Judge chasing a ghost dog who's carrying his jawbone around your house? Considering how many of the scenes involved Fox filming to nothing but air (and adding the ghosts in later), his performance is quite amazing. Giving virtual performances is often a trying experience and not everyone can pull it off, but there's no doubt in Fox's performance that the ghost world he can see exists as strongly as the physical world. Fox isn't alone in the performance department though. Jackson filled his spirit world with some spectacular actors, from Fox's "business partners", '70s afro-ed Chi McBride and geeky Jim Fyfe, to the more characterized performances of The Judge (John Astin), the drill sergeant guardian of the graveyard (R. Lee Ermey) and the evil spirit himself, played by Jake Busey in a role that makes him seem a little too much like his old man. Jackson's selections are a far cry from his prior independent film, mostly gained through the advantage of having Robert Zemeckis as the Executive Producer. The Frighteners marks that in-between period of Jackson's career, as he transitioned from a small-time independent horror director to the big budget filmmaker he'd become. This transition means there are some aspects of Jackson's less polished filmmaking involved. Most notably is something that hasn't gone away yet in Jackson's career: his insistence on filming in New Zealand.

    I remember my older brother showing me this movie when it first came out. I was younger and had a very vivid imagination so it scared the hell out of me. Today I went back and re-watched this movie I have not seen since then and while my imagination is still vivid, I respect the movie now because of it. The movie starts off I would say 80/20 Comedy/Horror. You get to see the shenanigans that MJF and his two ghost cohorts pull off. Watching the transformation of his character as he slowly realizes that he's up against more then he thought. The story develops unbelievably well. The characters (living and dead)are well thought out and brought to life, with such great enthusiasm it's amazing. The story evolves slowly and dramatically, each minute bringing more and more to the story. The acting is amazing. MJF, awesome. Playing both the con artist, and then the hero. Jake Busey pulls of crazy well, but then again he is his fathers son. The CGI I think is pretty awesome for the time. The grim reaper shots, still give me the creeps. Over all I have a love for this movie that makes me want to keep watching it again and again.

    The Frighteners is a fun little movie from the mid-90s. It has an pleasing mix of stars who hit their stride in the 80s (Fox,Wallace, and Ermey) and others who count this as among their first works (Alvarado, Busey, McBride). It is an odd mix of horror and humor from Peter Jackson and had state-of-the-art special effects for the time. The Frighteners, filmed and produced in New Zealand, was the biggest special effects movie made at that time outside the Hollywood movie base. It made extensive use of blue screens and had over 400 computer-enhanced special effects. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wrote the script and Jackson directed and produced the film. The Frighteners has an overall tone of whimsy but also has some impressive horror movie moments. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly. Frank Bannister, played by Fox, is a widowed psychic investigator exploring supernatural goings on in a placid rural town. Newcomer Alvarado plays his romantic interest. Veteran actor John Astin plays a ghost called The Judge who has seen his better days. Ermey plays drill instructor (go figure), Sgt Hiles, who is in charge of the local cemetery. He has several lines and a general demeanor that pays homage or satirizes (depending on your viewpoint) his character in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. Jake Busey plays a good bad man, and McBride plays a funny role as Bannister's ghostly aide. The Frighteners is amusing, frightening, entertaining, and a bit exhausting. It is a great Fall or Halloween movie.

    Accused of murder, a small-town psychic charlatan learns that his skills in dealing with the deceased are put to the test for real when the murder spree continues despite everything he can do to stop it and must keep the spirit from harming his friends. This here turned out to be quite an infuriating and quite troubling if somewhat interesting effort. Most of this is due to the fact that the film is far more of a fantasy effort that a straight-forward horror effort which is strange considering the subject matter at hand. This is mainly found in the finale at the hospital about the subject being sent into a heavenly arena and all the different after-effects on the body being adjusted to life back on Earth, all this just makes for a rather confusing time being that the main purpose is to stop the rampage of the ghostly figure throughout the town that only he can see and believe, so the sudden influx of mystical elements that this does at the very end makes for a confusing time. As well, the fact that these scenes force the film along far longer than it really should as the lengthy running time here really kills this one in that last section, not only with the sudden influx of fantasy but the mindless need to pay off far more plot- threads than it needed. Overall, this really could've used a few minutes shaved off here by deciding to abandon a few of these plots. That said, there's a lot to like here especially the scenes of the hooded ghostly menace in action, most notably the kinetic sequence in the holding cell where the good ghosts go fight the hooded ghost and take the fight between the walls and they good barreling through the different sections of the room as the humans watch and wait for them to appear and disappear, as well as a couple stellar attacks on a moving car that look absolutely amazing, an ambush in a graveyard and finally the hospital confrontation that makes for a lot of fun, so as an action film and horror film it definitely works wonders. As well, the CGI used is actually well-done and doesn't look cheap or fake at all, and gives the ghosts a fluidity that actually comes off nicely and makes up for some of the other flaws. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    Wow! Just watched this movie and what a trip it was!! I can't believe something as lame as Ghostbusters garnered all the attention while this gem was swept aside like the red-headed step-child. So many fantastic characters and twists and turns it made my head spin. I loved everything about this flick including the awesome special effects & the silly humour. Fox shone like he always does and the dude playing the insane FBI agent was brilliant!! Great story, wonderfully directed with great actors and a magic blend of hilarity, scariness, suspense, shocks and spookiness! I read some of the reviews here and can't believe how negative some of them are & the reasons they give for their negativity. eg "Oh boo hoo! It was awful coz the music sounded like some music I heard in another movie" and "Mr Jackson used CGI & expensive cameras and stuff & I don't think he should be allowed to, so I'm going to punish him with lower marks" etc etc Seriously? I think some people just love to be miserable. This is well worth seeing - it's just become one of my favourite movies. And now I just need to find (and buy) the Director's Cut for even more fun!

    This movie only becomes a kind of horror movie towards the end of it. Even then there is humor. I find this to be a rather funny show. Michael J. Fox does his usual fine job of acting, Trini Alvarado is cute as the widowed love interest, John Astin is good as a spirit named the Judge. There are a couple of things that do not hang together though. Why can the spirits go through walls, doors, etc but a vehicle that runs into them carries them along? Why did the murderer spirit's hand pass through Lucy's head and then he could punch her and Frank in the face and bodies? How about that FBI agent? Talk about a whack-a-doodle!! And how about that haircut of his? The sheriff is played by a long character actor Troy Evans. the mouth that roars "R. Lee Emery" appears here as the cemetery control freak sergeant and as usual about all he does is rant and rave.

    This one has received mixed Reviews. It's hard to imagine that anyone could be critical of the imagination that went into this entertaining, if overblown, Movie. It has enough energy and creativity for three Films. But it doesn't know when to quit. It just goes on and on, almost, but not quite, draining the fresh flourishes from the Film. There are Artistic touches that impress and it looks very much like the Cartoony Movies that Jackson had made up to this point. But this may have suffered from too much Zemeckis and too much Money. The Director never needed a lot of Money to make Cool, Off-Beat, and Artistically rewarding Stuff. Just one example, in the opening Scene we see an Evil Entity haunting a Women and it is shown protruding from behind walls and carpets. It is different and diabolical. But it won't be the last time this effect is used. Suffice to say that repetition is the bane of this really good Film. There are Plots on top of Plots and not just in the Cemetery. It could be just a bit too much for some, and yet it is so charming that others may say, give me more.

    Michael J.Fox (in what sadly became his last live-action movie role) is on fine form as troubled con-man,Frank Bannister who has the ability to see ghosts,and uses his unique gift to make money in the small town of Fairwater.He has his ghost "colleagues" haunt the houses of the residents and then offers his services to evict the spooks.It's the perfect scam until more and more healthy people start turning up dead,seemingly from heart attacks,and Frank soon realises that he must use his gift to stop a genuine evil spirit. Starting out like an all-out fantasy comedy,the film brilliantly switches tone around the halfway mark and becomes darker and more violent but director Peter Jackson never stops supplying the laughs either.The twisty plot takes in a host of unforgettable and quirky characters along for the ride.Trini Alvarado plays Lucy,probably the most normal character as a woman who loses her husband and finds herself becoming more involved with Frank and the strange goings on.John Astin,Chi Mcbride,and Jim Fyfe are hilarious as Frank's ghost pals who reluctantly help him out.Most of the film's funniest scenes feature these three characters and Frank's interactions with them.Peter Dobson as Lucy's dead husband Ray also adds a lot of fun into the proceedings.His banter with Fox is brilliant,especially in the scene where he goes to his own funeral.And last but not least is Jeffrey Combs' character, FBI agent Milton Dammers who is one of the weirdest lawmen in movie history.A deeply disturbed individual who has been undercover over the years so many times in different cults, without any therapy, that he has almost become insane himself. I've always loved this film and thought it was underrated and now I've seen the director's cut I love it even more.This version of the film makes the events and characters so much clearer.The mix of genres and the performances combine to fantastic effect in this top-notch film.

    Since his wife's murder, Frank Bannister (Michael J Fox) has made a living as a phony medium, preying on the recently bereaved. Except that Frank really can see ghosts. But when the ghost of a mass murderer returns, intent on continuing his handiwork, Frank's directionless existence must, of necessity, acquire some focus. This comedy horror film is effective as both. It occupies a pivotal place in Peter Jackson's filmography: Bad Taste showed that he could do good things with limited resources, Heavenly Creatures showed that he had some artistic chops, and now The Frighteners showed that he could be trusted with someone else's money to marshall script, effects, and performers into a pleasing end product. Next stop, obviously, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, then and now the biggest logistical and financial production exercise in the history of cinema and, then and now, a major financial and artistic triumph. The Frighteners is much smaller scale, of course, but with its own genre, it is a very successful film - exciting, amusing, suspenseful, and somewhat scary.

    The BEST Peter Jackson film that showcases what he does best: horror and comedy I can remember the scene as if it were yesterday. My older brother, father and 13 year old self hit the movie theater, pumped to see another Michael J. Fox/Zemeckis teaming that we have long since loved since the days of 'Back to the Future'. It's the day after the film opened and the theater was filled with about 10 people (my brother, dad and myself included). The movie rolls and, by the end, I was jumping with how incredibly cool and fun the movie was. And to this day, the same holds true: This is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, if not THE best, and is Jackson's best film to date. I'm sure, by now, you now the premise of the film based on the reviews prior to mine, so I wont bore you with all the babble of what the film is all about. I will, however, give my input as to why this film rocks!!! For one, it has Michael J. Fox. It had been a while since I had seen him in a film (I believe the last one I saw before 'The Frighteners' was 'Life With Mikey') and he was fantastic in this. His portrayal of a ghost hunting con man is a personal favorite of mine. No matter how he acted in the film, whether it was serious or downright goofy, he managed to keep his character extremely likable...as always...and interesting. It seems as though he had a blast with this film. Another reason why this film was so cool was the lack of EXTREME gore that Jackson had used and was known for in his prior films ('Bad Taste', 'Braindead'). Instead, he relied more on story and character development, along with creating some of the best ghost effects ever seen. He did all of this without having to sacrifice a great story with incredibly gory effects. Also, when was the last time you saw a ghost...bleed??? But these aren't the only reasons why you should see this movie. Here are ALL the other reasons why you shouldn't miss this film: -The awesome and strange Jeffrey "Yes I am, I'm an ass****...with a Uzi!" Combs ('Re-Animator') in a GREAT, GREAT...GREAT performance. -The very talented and always sweet Dee Wallace-Stone ('The Howling', 'The Hills Have Eyes') in a very creepy performance. -Another incredibly brilliant, atmospheric and moody score from the great Danny Elfman ('Batman', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'). There were also A lot of great surprises in this film: -R. Lee Ermey ('Full Metal Jacket', 'Willard') in a classic spoof of one of his own characters, from another film. An amazing touch. -John Astin (Gomez, 'The Addams Family' TV show) in a very good performance as the coolest looking ghost of all: A rotting Judge (they don't call him the hanging judge for nothing'). And a surprisingly good Jake Busey ('Starship Troopers') as a serial killer. (You will never see teeth as perfect and as white in another film until you see Jake's when he is killing people. They are very "Looney Tunes"...which was a very nice touch to make his character extra creepy.) All of this, along with a cool, afro-sporting, funky 70's ghost of Chi McBride ('Boston Public'), an underrated Trini Alvarado and not to mention the awesome script, makes this a film that should be on your "TO WATCH RIGHT NOW" list if you haven't seen it already. * If anything, watch this film for the final half, especially when our two heroes enter the old, abandoned Hospital. Some cool, cool stuff. * With the LOTR films, I'm sure there are a lot people who have either seen or have yet to see this film solely because of those fantasy epics, which is sad because this is a wonderful film all by itself. I'm proud to say that I saw this film when it opened, in the theater, and that I have been a fan of this and many of Jackson's earlier (and much better) films for a long time now. I am just as pumped for this new unrated directors cut as I was that day at the movies when I was 13. I'm anxious to see what kind of extra footage is in this version. I'm hoping, like many others, that they will have the complete documentary on this film because that would just be the icing on the cake. All that we fans can do now is wait and watch the calendar for the day this DVD arrives. Visually stunning and atmospheric, very funny, very spooky (at times very serious) but ALWAYS fun, THE FRIGHTENERS has everything you need for a night of great movie watching. NOTE: If you're not a fan of gore, you're in luck. This film has very minimal gore. Yes, there is blood and some gory moments, but for the most part, it's VERY timid compared to Peter Jackson's older films that include some of the goriest scenes in movie history. (i.e. 'Braindead'). It's enough to satisfy all you gore-hounds out there, but not so much that it will turn you non-gore fans away. So if your "dying" to see a great, frighteningly funny and spooky film, check out THE FRIGHTENERS...before your number is up. Because, "When your numbers up...*SNAP*...that's it."

I think some people just love to be miserable. This is well worth seeing - it's just become one of my favourite movies. And now I just need to find (and buy) the Director's Cut for even more fun!

    This movie only becomes a kind of horror movie towards the end of it. Even then there is humor. I find this to be a rather funny show. Michael J. Fox does his usual fine job of acting, Trini Alvarado is cute as the widowed love interest, John Astin is good as a spirit named the Judge. There are a couple of things that do not hang together though. Why can the spirits go through walls, doors, etc but a vehicle that runs into them carries them along? Why did the murderer spirit's hand pass through Lucy's head and then he could punch her and Frank in the face and bodies? How about that FBI agent? Talk about a whack-a-doodle!! And how about that haircut of his? The sheriff is played by a long character actor Troy Evans. the mouth that roars "R. Lee Emery" appears here as the cemetery control freak sergeant and as usual about all he does is rant and rave.

    This one has received mixed Reviews. It's hard to imagine that anyone could be critical of the imagination that went into this entertaining, if overblown, Movie. It has enough energy and creativity for three Films. But it doesn't know when to quit. It just goes on and on, almost, but not quite, draining the fresh flourishes from the Film. There are Artistic touches that impress and it looks very much like the Cartoony Movies that Jackson had made up to this point. But this may have suffered from too much Zemeckis and too much Money. The Director never needed a lot of Money to make Cool, Off-Beat, and Artistically rewarding Stuff. Just one example, in the opening Scene we see an Evil Entity haunting a Women and it is shown protruding from behind walls and carpets. It is different and diabolical. But it won't be the last time this effect is used. Suffice to say that repetition is the bane of this really good Film. There are Plots on top of Plots and not just in the Cemetery. It could be just a bit too much for some, and yet it is so charming that others may say, give me more.

    Michael J.Fox (in what sadly became his last live-action movie role) is on fine form as troubled con-man,Frank Bannister who has the ability to see ghosts,and uses his unique gift to make money in the small town of Fairwater.He has his ghost "colleagues" haunt the houses of the residents and then offers his services to evict the spooks.It's the perfect scam until more and more healthy people start turning up dead,seemingly from heart attacks,and Frank soon realises that he must use his gift to stop a genuine evil spirit. Starting out like an all-out fantasy comedy,the film brilliantly switches tone around the halfway mark and becomes darker and more violent but director Peter Jackson never stops supplying the laughs either.The twisty plot takes in a host of unforgettable and quirky characters along for the ride.Trini Alvarado plays Lucy,probably the most normal character as a woman who loses her husband and finds herself becoming more involved with Frank and the strange goings on.John Astin,Chi Mcbride,and Jim Fyfe are hilarious as Frank's ghost pals who reluctantly help him out.Most of the film's funniest scenes feature these three characters and Frank's interactions with them.Peter Dobson as Lucy's dead husband Ray also adds a lot of fun into the proceedings.His banter with Fox is brilliant,especially in the scene where he goes to his own funeral.And last but not least is Jeffrey Combs' character, FBI agent Milton Dammers who is one of the weirdest lawmen in movie history.A deeply disturbed individual who has been undercover over the years so many times in different cults, without any therapy, that he has almost become insane himself. I've always loved this film and thought it was underrated and now I've seen the director's cut I love it even more.This version of the film makes the events and characters so much clearer.The mix of genres and the performances combine to fantastic effect in this top-notch film.

    Since his wife's murder, Frank Bannister (Michael J Fox) has made a living as a phony medium, preying on the recently bereaved. Except that Frank really can see ghosts. But when the ghost of a mass murderer returns, intent on continuing his handiwork, Frank's directionless existence must, of necessity, acquire some focus. This comedy horror film is effective as both. It occupies a pivotal place in Peter Jackson's filmography: Bad Taste showed that he could do good things with limited resources, Heavenly Creatures showed that he had some artistic chops, and now The Frighteners showed that he could be trusted with someone else's money to marshall script, effects, and performers into a pleasing end product. Next stop, obviously, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, then and now the biggest logistical and financial production exercise in the history of cinema and, then and now, a major financial and artistic triumph. The Frighteners is much smaller scale, of course, but with its own genre, it is a very successful film - exciting, amusing, suspenseful, and somewhat scary.

    The BEST Peter Jackson film that showcases what he does best: horror and comedy I can remember the scene as if it were yesterday. My older brother, father and 13 year old self hit the movie theater, pumped to see another Michael J. Fox/Zemeckis teaming that we have long since loved since the days of 'Back to the Future'. It's the day after the film opened and the theater was filled with about 10 people (my brother, dad and myself included). The movie rolls and, by the end, I was jumping with how incredibly cool and fun the movie was. And to this day, the same holds true: This is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, if not THE best, and is Jackson's best film to date. I'm sure, by now, you now the premise of the film based on the reviews prior to mine, so I wont bore you with all the babble of what the film is all about. I will, however, give my input as to why this film rocks!!! For one, it has Michael J. Fox. It had been a while since I had seen him in a film (I believe the last one I saw before 'The Frighteners' was 'Life With Mikey') and he was fantastic in this. His portrayal of a ghost hunting con man is a personal favorite of mine. No matter how he acted in the film, whether it was serious or downright goofy, he managed to keep his character extremely likable...as always...and interesting. It seems as though he had a blast with this film. Another reason why this film was so cool was the lack of EXTREME gore that Jackson had used and was known for in his prior films ('Bad Taste', 'Braindead'). Instead, he relied more on story and character development, along with creating some of the best ghost effects ever seen. He did all of this without having to sacrifice a great story with incredibly gory effects. Also, when was the last time you saw a ghost...bleed??? But these aren't the only reasons why you should see this movie. Here are ALL the other reasons why you shouldn't miss this film: -The awesome and strange Jeffrey "Yes I am, I'm an ass****...with a Uzi!" Combs ('Re-Animator') in a GREAT, GREAT...GREAT performance. -The very talented and always sweet Dee Wallace-Stone ('The Howling', 'The Hills Have Eyes') in a very creepy performance. -Another incredibly brilliant, atmospheric and moody score from the great Danny Elfman ('Batman', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'). There were also A lot of great surprises in this film: -R. Lee Ermey ('Full Metal Jacket', 'Willard') in a classic spoof of one of his own characters, from another film. An amazing touch. -John Astin (Gomez, 'The Addams Family' TV show) in a very good performance as the coolest looking ghost of all: A rotting Judge (they don't call him the hanging judge for nothing'). And a surprisingly good Jake Busey ('Starship Troopers') as a serial killer. (You will never see teeth as perfect and as white in another film until you see Jake's when he is killing people. They are very "Looney Tunes"...which was a very nice touch to make his character extra creepy.) All of this, along with a cool, afro-sporting, funky 70's ghost of Chi McBride ('Boston Public'), an underrated Trini Alvarado and not to mention the awesome script, makes this a film that should be on your "TO WATCH RIGHT NOW" list if you haven't seen it already. * If anything, watch this film for the final half, especially when our two heroes enter the old, abandoned Hospital. Some cool, cool stuff. * With the LOTR films, I'm sure there are a lot people who have either seen or have yet to see this film solely because of those fantasy epics, which is sad because this is a wonderful film all by itself. I'm proud to say that I saw this film when it opened, in the theater, and that I have been a fan of this and many of Jackson's earlier (and much better) films for a long time now. I am just as pumped for this new unrated directors cut as I was that day at the movies when I was 13. I'm anxious to see what kind of extra footage is in this version. I'm hoping, like many others, that they will have the complete documentary on this film because that would just be the icing on the cake. All that we fans can do now is wait and watch the calendar for the day this DVD arrives. Visually stunning and atmospheric, very funny, very spooky (at times very serious) but ALWAYS fun, THE FRIGHTENERS has everything you need for a night of great movie watching. NOTE: If you're not a fan of gore, you're in luck. This film has very minimal gore. Yes, there is blood and some gory moments, but for the most part, it's VERY timid compared to Peter Jackson's older films that include some of the goriest scenes in movie history. (i.e. 'Braindead'). It's enough to satisfy all you gore-hounds out there, but not so much that it will turn you non-gore fans away. So if your "dying" to see a great, frighteningly funny and spooky film, check out THE FRIGHTENERS...before your number is up. Because, "When your numbers up...*SNAP*...that's it."

    The basic concept of what Jackson was trying to do with The Frighteners is what originally drew me to the movie (remember, this was back in the day when Jackson himself was relatively unknown). Unlike the Ghostbusters Peter Venkman, who was more than content to dupe people into believing in supernatural, the lead character in The Frighteners fully believes in the existence of the supernatural, even using his own connections with the supernatural world to help convince people they are being haunted. He then goes in and cleans up the haunting, charging exorbitant fees for his services. That subtle difference in a character's motivations really made me interested, especially knowing the lead was being played by Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors. The problem for Fox's Frank Bannister comes when his own con-job comes true, a real haunting is going on by an extremely nasty ghost who's not just haunting, but killing people. Due to his own supernatural powers, Bannister can see who the evil spirit has slated for death, putting him in the awkward position of stopping the spirit and saving the doomed people, even those who have attempted to debunk Bannister's abilities. Michael J. Fox is brilliant in the leading role. Until this point, most of the characters Fox had played were really goody-two-shoes types, from Back to the Future's to "Family Ties". Frank Bannister is a person who is uncomfortable around people due to his supernatural connections. There is nothing overt about Fox's performance that communicates this, it's in the little things: the way he conducts himself around people to his clothes and haircut. At the same time, Bannister isn't quite at home with the ghosts that surround him. Honestly, how comfortable could it be to have a ghostly old-west Judge chasing a ghost dog who's carrying his jawbone around your house? Considering how many of the scenes involved Fox filming to nothing but air (and adding the ghosts in later), his performance is quite amazing. Giving virtual performances is often a trying experience and not everyone can pull it off, but there's no doubt in Fox's performance that the ghost world he can see exists as strongly as the physical world. Fox isn't alone in the performance department though. Jackson filled his spirit world with some spectacular actors, from Fox's "business partners", '70s afro-ed Chi McBride and geeky Jim Fyfe, to the more characterized performances of The Judge (John Astin), the drill sergeant guardian of the graveyard (R. Lee Ermey) and the evil spirit himself, played by Jake Busey in a role that makes him seem a little too much like his old man. Jackson's selections are a far cry from his prior independent film, mostly gained through the advantage of having Robert Zemeckis as the Executive Producer. The Frighteners marks that in-between period of Jackson's career, as he transitioned from a small-time independent horror director to the big budget filmmaker he'd become. This transition means there are some aspects of Jackson's less polished filmmaking involved. Most notably is something that hasn't gone away yet in Jackson's career: his insistence on filming in New Zealand.

    I remember my older brother showing me this movie when it first came out. I was younger and had a very vivid imagination so it scared the hell out of me. Today I went back and re-watched this movie I have not seen since then and while my imagination is still vivid, I respect the movie now because of it. The movie starts off I would say 80/20 Comedy/Horror. You get to see the shenanigans that MJF and his two ghost cohorts pull off. Watching the transformation of his character as he slowly realizes that he's up against more then he thought. The story develops unbelievably well. The characters (living and dead)are well thought out and brought to life, with such great enthusiasm it's amazing. The story evolves slowly and dramatically, each minute bringing more and more to the story. The acting is amazing. MJF, awesome. Playing both the con artist, and then the hero. Jake Busey pulls of crazy well, but then again he is his fathers son. The CGI I think is pretty awesome for the time. The grim reaper shots, still give me the creeps. Over all I have a love for this movie that makes me want to keep watching it again and again.

    The Frighteners is a fun little movie from the mid-90s. It has an pleasing mix of stars who hit their stride in the 80s (Fox,Wallace, and Ermey) and others who count this as among their first works (Alvarado, Busey, McBride). It is an odd mix of horror and humor from Peter Jackson and had state-of-the-art special effects for the time. The Frighteners, filmed and produced in New Zealand, was the biggest special effects movie made at that time outside the Hollywood movie base. It made extensive use of blue screens and had over 400 computer-enhanced special effects. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wrote the script and Jackson directed and produced the film. The Frighteners has an overall tone of whimsy but also has some impressive horror movie moments. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly. Frank Bannister, played by Fox, is a widowed psychic investigator exploring supernatural goings on in a placid rural town. Newcomer Alvarado plays his romantic interest. Veteran actor John Astin plays a ghost called The Judge who has seen his better days. Ermey plays drill instructor (go figure), Sgt Hiles, who is in charge of the local cemetery. He has several lines and a general demeanor that pays homage or satirizes (depending on your viewpoint) his character in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. Jake Busey plays a good bad man, and McBride plays a funny role as Bannister's ghostly aide. The Frighteners is amusing, frightening, entertaining, and a bit exhausting. It is a great Fall or Halloween movie.

    Accused of murder, a small-town psychic charlatan learns that his skills in dealing with the deceased are put to the test for real when the murder spree continues despite everything he can do to stop it and must keep the spirit from harming his friends. This here turned out to be quite an infuriating and quite troubling if somewhat interesting effort. Most of this is due to the fact that the film is far more of a fantasy effort that a straight-forward horror effort which is strange considering the subject matter at hand. This is mainly found in the finale at the hospital about the subject being sent into a heavenly arena and all the different after-effects on the body being adjusted to life back on Earth, all this just makes for a rather confusing time being that the main purpose is to stop the rampage of the ghostly figure throughout the town that only he can see and believe, so the sudden influx of mystical elements that this does at the very end makes for a confusing time. As well, the fact that these scenes force the film along far longer than it really should as the lengthy running time here really kills this one in that last section, not only with the sudden influx of fantasy but the mindless need to pay off far more plot- threads than it needed. Overall, this really could've used a few minutes shaved off here by deciding to abandon a few of these plots. That said, there's a lot to like here especially the scenes of the hooded ghostly menace in action, most notably the kinetic sequence in the holding cell where the good ghosts go fight the hooded ghost and take the fight between the walls and they good barreling through the different sections of the room as the humans watch and wait for them to appear and disappear, as well as a couple stellar attacks on a moving car that look absolutely amazing, an ambush in a graveyard and finally the hospital confrontation that makes for a lot of fun, so as an action film and horror film it definitely works wonders. As well, the CGI used is actually well-done and doesn't look cheap or fake at all, and gives the ghosts a fluidity that actually comes off nicely and makes up for some of the other flaws. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    Wow! Just watched this movie and what a trip it was!! I can't believe something as lame as Ghostbusters garnered all the attention while this gem was swept aside like the red-headed step-child. So many fantastic characters and twists and turns it made my head spin. I loved everything about this flick including the awesome special effects & the silly humour. Fox shone like he always does and the dude playing the insane FBI agent was brilliant!! Great story, wonderfully directed with great actors and a magic blend of hilarity, scariness, suspense, shocks and spookiness! I read some of the reviews here and can't believe how negative some of them are & the reasons they give for their negativity. eg "Oh boo hoo! It was awful coz the music sounded like some music I heard in another movie" and "Mr Jackson used CGI & expensive cameras and stuff & I don't think he should be allowed to, so I'm going to punish him with lower marks" etc etc Seriously?

I'm proud to say that I saw this film when it opened, in the theater, and that I have been a fan of this and many of Jackson's earlier (and much better) films for a long time now. I am just as pumped for this new unrated directors cut as I was that day at the movies when I was 13. I'm anxious to see what kind of extra footage is in this version. I'm hoping, like many others, that they will have the complete documentary on this film because that would just be the icing on the cake. All that we fans can do now is wait and watch the calendar for the day this DVD arrives. Visually stunning and atmospheric, very funny, very spooky (at times very serious) but ALWAYS fun, THE FRIGHTENERS has everything you need for a night of great movie watching. NOTE: If you're not a fan of gore, you're in luck. This film has very minimal gore. Yes, there is blood and some gory moments, but for the most part, it's VERY timid compared to Peter Jackson's older films that include some of the goriest scenes in movie history. (i.e. 'Braindead'). It's enough to satisfy all you gore-hounds out there, but not so much that it will turn you non-gore fans away. So if your "dying" to see a great, frighteningly funny and spooky film, check out THE FRIGHTENERS...before your number is up. Because, "When your numbers up...*SNAP*...that's it."

    The basic concept of what Jackson was trying to do with The Frighteners is what originally drew me to the movie (remember, this was back in the day when Jackson himself was relatively unknown). Unlike the Ghostbusters Peter Venkman, who was more than content to dupe people into believing in supernatural, the lead character in The Frighteners fully believes in the existence of the supernatural, even using his own connections with the supernatural world to help convince people they are being haunted. He then goes in and cleans up the haunting, charging exorbitant fees for his services. That subtle difference in a character's motivations really made me interested, especially knowing the lead was being played by Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors. The problem for Fox's Frank Bannister comes when his own con-job comes true, a real haunting is going on by an extremely nasty ghost who's not just haunting, but killing people. Due to his own supernatural powers, Bannister can see who the evil spirit has slated for death, putting him in the awkward position of stopping the spirit and saving the doomed people, even those who have attempted to debunk Bannister's abilities. Michael J. Fox is brilliant in the leading role. Until this point, most of the characters Fox had played were really goody-two-shoes types, from Back to the Future's to "Family Ties". Frank Bannister is a person who is uncomfortable around people due to his supernatural connections. There is nothing overt about Fox's performance that communicates this, it's in the little things: the way he conducts himself around people to his clothes and haircut. At the same time, Bannister isn't quite at home with the ghosts that surround him. Honestly, how comfortable could it be to have a ghostly old-west Judge chasing a ghost dog who's carrying his jawbone around your house? Considering how many of the scenes involved Fox filming to nothing but air (and adding the ghosts in later), his performance is quite amazing. Giving virtual performances is often a trying experience and not everyone can pull it off, but there's no doubt in Fox's performance that the ghost world he can see exists as strongly as the physical world. Fox isn't alone in the performance department though. Jackson filled his spirit world with some spectacular actors, from Fox's "business partners", '70s afro-ed Chi McBride and geeky Jim Fyfe, to the more characterized performances of The Judge (John Astin), the drill sergeant guardian of the graveyard (R. Lee Ermey) and the evil spirit himself, played by Jake Busey in a role that makes him seem a little too much like his old man. Jackson's selections are a far cry from his prior independent film, mostly gained through the advantage of having Robert Zemeckis as the Executive Producer. The Frighteners marks that in-between period of Jackson's career, as he transitioned from a small-time independent horror director to the big budget filmmaker he'd become. This transition means there are some aspects of Jackson's less polished filmmaking involved. Most notably is something that hasn't gone away yet in Jackson's career: his insistence on filming in New Zealand.

    I remember my older brother showing me this movie when it first came out. I was younger and had a very vivid imagination so it scared the hell out of me. Today I went back and re-watched this movie I have not seen since then and while my imagination is still vivid, I respect the movie now because of it. The movie starts off I would say 80/20 Comedy/Horror. You get to see the shenanigans that MJF and his two ghost cohorts pull off. Watching the transformation of his character as he slowly realizes that he's up against more then he thought. The story develops unbelievably well. The characters (living and dead)are well thought out and brought to life, with such great enthusiasm it's amazing. The story evolves slowly and dramatically, each minute bringing more and more to the story. The acting is amazing. MJF, awesome. Playing both the con artist, and then the hero. Jake Busey pulls of crazy well, but then again he is his fathers son. The CGI I think is pretty awesome for the time. The grim reaper shots, still give me the creeps. Over all I have a love for this movie that makes me want to keep watching it again and again.

    The Frighteners is a fun little movie from the mid-90s. It has an pleasing mix of stars who hit their stride in the 80s (Fox,Wallace, and Ermey) and others who count this as among their first works (Alvarado, Busey, McBride). It is an odd mix of horror and humor from Peter Jackson and had state-of-the-art special effects for the time. The Frighteners, filmed and produced in New Zealand, was the biggest special effects movie made at that time outside the Hollywood movie base. It made extensive use of blue screens and had over 400 computer-enhanced special effects. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wrote the script and Jackson directed and produced the film. The Frighteners has an overall tone of whimsy but also has some impressive horror movie moments. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly. Frank Bannister, played by Fox, is a widowed psychic investigator exploring supernatural goings on in a placid rural town. Newcomer Alvarado plays his romantic interest. Veteran actor John Astin plays a ghost called The Judge who has seen his better days. Ermey plays drill instructor (go figure), Sgt Hiles, who is in charge of the local cemetery. He has several lines and a general demeanor that pays homage or satirizes (depending on your viewpoint) his character in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. Jake Busey plays a good bad man, and McBride plays a funny role as Bannister's ghostly aide. The Frighteners is amusing, frightening, entertaining, and a bit exhausting. It is a great Fall or Halloween movie.

    Accused of murder, a small-town psychic charlatan learns that his skills in dealing with the deceased are put to the test for real when the murder spree continues despite everything he can do to stop it and must keep the spirit from harming his friends. This here turned out to be quite an infuriating and quite troubling if somewhat interesting effort. Most of this is due to the fact that the film is far more of a fantasy effort that a straight-forward horror effort which is strange considering the subject matter at hand. This is mainly found in the finale at the hospital about the subject being sent into a heavenly arena and all the different after-effects on the body being adjusted to life back on Earth, all this just makes for a rather confusing time being that the main purpose is to stop the rampage of the ghostly figure throughout the town that only he can see and believe, so the sudden influx of mystical elements that this does at the very end makes for a confusing time. As well, the fact that these scenes force the film along far longer than it really should as the lengthy running time here really kills this one in that last section, not only with the sudden influx of fantasy but the mindless need to pay off far more plot- threads than it needed. Overall, this really could've used a few minutes shaved off here by deciding to abandon a few of these plots. That said, there's a lot to like here especially the scenes of the hooded ghostly menace in action, most notably the kinetic sequence in the holding cell where the good ghosts go fight the hooded ghost and take the fight between the walls and they good barreling through the different sections of the room as the humans watch and wait for them to appear and disappear, as well as a couple stellar attacks on a moving car that look absolutely amazing, an ambush in a graveyard and finally the hospital confrontation that makes for a lot of fun, so as an action film and horror film it definitely works wonders. As well, the CGI used is actually well-done and doesn't look cheap or fake at all, and gives the ghosts a fluidity that actually comes off nicely and makes up for some of the other flaws. Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

    Wow! Just watched this movie and what a trip it was!! I can't believe something as lame as Ghostbusters garnered all the attention while this gem was swept aside like the red-headed step-child. So many fantastic characters and twists and turns it made my head spin. I loved everything about this flick including the awesome special effects & the silly humour. Fox shone like he always does and the dude playing the insane FBI agent was brilliant!! Great story, wonderfully directed with great actors and a magic blend of hilarity, scariness, suspense, shocks and spookiness! I read some of the reviews here and can't believe how negative some of them are & the reasons they give for their negativity. eg "Oh boo hoo! It was awful coz the music sounded like some music I heard in another movie" and "Mr Jackson used CGI & expensive cameras and stuff & I don't think he should be allowed to, so I'm going to punish him with lower marks" etc etc Seriously? I think some people just love to be miserable. This is well worth seeing - it's just become one of my favourite movies. And now I just need to find (and buy) the Director's Cut for even more fun!

    This movie only becomes a kind of horror movie towards the end of it. Even then there is humor. I find this to be a rather funny show. Michael J. Fox does his usual fine job of acting, Trini Alvarado is cute as the widowed love interest, John Astin is good as a spirit named the Judge. There are a couple of things that do not hang together though. Why can the spirits go through walls, doors, etc but a vehicle that runs into them carries them along? Why did the murderer spirit's hand pass through Lucy's head and then he could punch her and Frank in the face and bodies? How about that FBI agent? Talk about a whack-a-doodle!! And how about that haircut of his? The sheriff is played by a long character actor Troy Evans. the mouth that roars "R. Lee Emery" appears here as the cemetery control freak sergeant and as usual about all he does is rant and rave.

    This one has received mixed Reviews. It's hard to imagine that anyone could be critical of the imagination that went into this entertaining, if overblown, Movie. It has enough energy and creativity for three Films. But it doesn't know when to quit. It just goes on and on, almost, but not quite, draining the fresh flourishes from the Film. There are Artistic touches that impress and it looks very much like the Cartoony Movies that Jackson had made up to this point. But this may have suffered from too much Zemeckis and too much Money. The Director never needed a lot of Money to make Cool, Off-Beat, and Artistically rewarding Stuff. Just one example, in the opening Scene we see an Evil Entity haunting a Women and it is shown protruding from behind walls and carpets. It is different and diabolical. But it won't be the last time this effect is used. Suffice to say that repetition is the bane of this really good Film. There are Plots on top of Plots and not just in the Cemetery. It could be just a bit too much for some, and yet it is so charming that others may say, give me more.

    Michael J.Fox (in what sadly became his last live-action movie role) is on fine form as troubled con-man,Frank Bannister who has the ability to see ghosts,and uses his unique gift to make money in the small town of Fairwater.He has his ghost "colleagues" haunt the houses of the residents and then offers his services to evict the spooks.It's the perfect scam until more and more healthy people start turning up dead,seemingly from heart attacks,and Frank soon realises that he must use his gift to stop a genuine evil spirit. Starting out like an all-out fantasy comedy,the film brilliantly switches tone around the halfway mark and becomes darker and more violent but director Peter Jackson never stops supplying the laughs either.The twisty plot takes in a host of unforgettable and quirky characters along for the ride.Trini Alvarado plays Lucy,probably the most normal character as a woman who loses her husband and finds herself becoming more involved with Frank and the strange goings on.John Astin,Chi Mcbride,and Jim Fyfe are hilarious as Frank's ghost pals who reluctantly help him out.Most of the film's funniest scenes feature these three characters and Frank's interactions with them.Peter Dobson as Lucy's dead husband Ray also adds a lot of fun into the proceedings.His banter with Fox is brilliant,especially in the scene where he goes to his own funeral.And last but not least is Jeffrey Combs' character, FBI agent Milton Dammers who is one of the weirdest lawmen in movie history.A deeply disturbed individual who has been undercover over the years so many times in different cults, without any therapy, that he has almost become insane himself. I've always loved this film and thought it was underrated and now I've seen the director's cut I love it even more.This version of the film makes the events and characters so much clearer.The mix of genres and the performances combine to fantastic effect in this top-notch film.

    Since his wife's murder, Frank Bannister (Michael J Fox) has made a living as a phony medium, preying on the recently bereaved. Except that Frank really can see ghosts. But when the ghost of a mass murderer returns, intent on continuing his handiwork, Frank's directionless existence must, of necessity, acquire some focus. This comedy horror film is effective as both. It occupies a pivotal place in Peter Jackson's filmography: Bad Taste showed that he could do good things with limited resources, Heavenly Creatures showed that he had some artistic chops, and now The Frighteners showed that he could be trusted with someone else's money to marshall script, effects, and performers into a pleasing end product. Next stop, obviously, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, then and now the biggest logistical and financial production exercise in the history of cinema and, then and now, a major financial and artistic triumph. The Frighteners is much smaller scale, of course, but with its own genre, it is a very successful film - exciting, amusing, suspenseful, and somewhat scary.

    The BEST Peter Jackson film that showcases what he does best: horror and comedy I can remember the scene as if it were yesterday. My older brother, father and 13 year old self hit the movie theater, pumped to see another Michael J. Fox/Zemeckis teaming that we have long since loved since the days of 'Back to the Future'. It's the day after the film opened and the theater was filled with about 10 people (my brother, dad and myself included). The movie rolls and, by the end, I was jumping with how incredibly cool and fun the movie was. And to this day, the same holds true: This is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, if not THE best, and is Jackson's best film to date. I'm sure, by now, you now the premise of the film based on the reviews prior to mine, so I wont bore you with all the babble of what the film is all about. I will, however, give my input as to why this film rocks!!! For one, it has Michael J. Fox. It had been a while since I had seen him in a film (I believe the last one I saw before 'The Frighteners' was 'Life With Mikey') and he was fantastic in this. His portrayal of a ghost hunting con man is a personal favorite of mine. No matter how he acted in the film, whether it was serious or downright goofy, he managed to keep his character extremely likable...as always...and interesting. It seems as though he had a blast with this film. Another reason why this film was so cool was the lack of EXTREME gore that Jackson had used and was known for in his prior films ('Bad Taste', 'Braindead'). Instead, he relied more on story and character development, along with creating some of the best ghost effects ever seen. He did all of this without having to sacrifice a great story with incredibly gory effects. Also, when was the last time you saw a ghost...bleed??? But these aren't the only reasons why you should see this movie. Here are ALL the other reasons why you shouldn't miss this film: -The awesome and strange Jeffrey "Yes I am, I'm an ass****...with a Uzi!" Combs ('Re-Animator') in a GREAT, GREAT...GREAT performance. -The very talented and always sweet Dee Wallace-Stone ('The Howling', 'The Hills Have Eyes') in a very creepy performance. -Another incredibly brilliant, atmospheric and moody score from the great Danny Elfman ('Batman', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'). There were also A lot of great surprises in this film: -R. Lee Ermey ('Full Metal Jacket', 'Willard') in a classic spoof of one of his own characters, from another film. An amazing touch. -John Astin (Gomez, 'The Addams Family' TV show) in a very good performance as the coolest looking ghost of all: A rotting Judge (they don't call him the hanging judge for nothing'). And a surprisingly good Jake Busey ('Starship Troopers') as a serial killer. (You will never see teeth as perfect and as white in another film until you see Jake's when he is killing people. They are very "Looney Tunes"...which was a very nice touch to make his character extra creepy.) All of this, along with a cool, afro-sporting, funky 70's ghost of Chi McBride ('Boston Public'), an underrated Trini Alvarado and not to mention the awesome script, makes this a film that should be on your "TO WATCH RIGHT NOW" list if you haven't seen it already. * If anything, watch this film for the final half, especially when our two heroes enter the old, abandoned Hospital. Some cool, cool stuff. * With the LOTR films, I'm sure there are a lot people who have either seen or have yet to see this film solely because of those fantasy epics, which is sad because this is a wonderful film all by itself. I'm proud to say that I saw this film when it opened, in the theater, and that I have been a fan of this and many of Jackson's earlier (and much better) films for a long time now. I am just as pumped for this new unrated directors cut as I was that day at the movies when I was 13. I'm anxious to see what kind of extra footage is in this version.
