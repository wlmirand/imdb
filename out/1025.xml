    Here's another attempt from Seagal to send a important message to the world  be careful with the environment . And it's just as wonderful as "On deadly ground" . It's not a bad thing when you're trying to say something important. It's bad when you fail to both entertain and send a message. The message here seems sincere , but it's too preachy just like in "ODG" . What is more important is for an action movie "FDB" sucks . The shootouts and car chases are badly edited. You can't see a thing ! Same goes for fight scenes . There is one fight scene at the beginning of the movie  Seagal fights with few opponents . He beats down one of them , then he defeats second one , then he punches the guy THAT WAS DEFEATED AS FIRST AND LYING UNCONSCIOUS ON GROUND , then he defeats the third one . Talk about bad montage The movie also tries to put Seagal in believable romantic story , but it fails just as always. The only thing good here is the guitar music . Anyway , this is a really bad movie . Second in Seagal's "save the environment trilogy " ( The trilogy includes "On deadly ground" , "Fire down below" and "The Patriot" ). I give it 1/10.

    A bland eco-muddle that fails to settle on a genre. The gear-shifting mixture of romance, action, drama and environmental preaching just doesn't work, and it's not made any more successful by Steven Seagal's rubbish performance, which consists of his usual frowning routine with a hint of constipation and a touch of whispery woodenness. He seems to be acting in a completely different film to the rest of the cast and constantly undermines the sparks of interest that pop up from time to time. This well-intentioned but flat movie trundles along painlessly for 100 minutes or so while the small-town-versus-rich-boss clich&eacute;s pile up around everyone's feet, then Harry Dean Stanton sings a song, and that's that.

    I watched "Fire Down Below" on a twelve-hours coach trip to Paris, in double bill with "The Sixth Sense" (go figure). Despite Steven Seagal's colourful jackets, this is actually a very entertaining action film. In my humble opinion, two things make it recommendable. The first is the heroine, excellently played by Marg Helbenberg, who brings lots of humanity to her character. It is a pity she did not have a more expressive actor to react to her (although Seagal is good in the action bits which, after all, are his thing). The second (and foremost) is the last scene, the one with Harry Dean Stanton singing and dancing in his newly built porch. Stanton (especially remembered for "Paris, Texas")is one of those actors who have been there for ages but never became a star, whose face is familiar but whose name escapes us. The scene reminds me of that character in "The Searchers", who only wanted "a rocking chair in a porch" in his old age. It is an homage to a veteran actor, a secondary in hundreds of classic westerns and also an accomplished musician. Watching him play "Kentucky Waltz" made me wish the credits rolled forever. A 6 for the film and a 10 for this scene.

    Plot Synopsis: Jack Taggart, an agent working for the EPA, is shocked to discover that his best friend & fellow agent has been killed while investigating reports of people in a rural town in Kentucky getting sick. Posing as a church mission carpenter, he visits the town, uncovering a conspiracy to dump toxic waste in the abandoned coal mines in the nearby mountains by Orin Hanner, a shady businessman whose son runs the town. Faced with a wall of silence in the town & the presence of the dumpers, Jack attempts to expose the dumping & prosecute the people responsible. Film Review: Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers  Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death. As for Steven Seagal, the real-life aikido master, police officer (I'm serious), blues musician & actor (I was going to include CIA agent in that list of achievements but I'm not exactly sure if Seagal ever worked for the agency for real), he tried to reinvent himself as an environmental activist, making a trilogy of films in the mid-to-late 1990s that were eco-thrillers (ON DEADLY GROUND, Fire Down Below & The Patriot) at least in basic plot thematics, that is. Excepting On Deadly Ground, these pro-environment films almost killed Seagal's career stone dead, mainly due to being ridiculously heavy-handed  the villains are all very shrill one-dimensional cardboard cutouts & clich&eacute;s; the scripts are poorly written; & the most serious flaw of all  the action scenes are poorly staged. Fire Down Below starts out in a way that seems to indicate that Seagal is planning to forsake his customary martial arts sequences for some good old fashioned investigative skills. Not counting the short scene where Seagal stumbles onto a cannabis hydroponics farm, there seems to be a lack of anything that even remotely resembles the sort of brutal martial arts fights that Seagal's early films had showcased. But shortly after it starts, the film degenerates into a muddled blend of one-dimensional stereotypes, tepid car chases & poorly-choreographed fight scenes. There are two things I hate while watching films  having my intelligence insulted & being preached to (by that I don't mean social commentaries or satire  I mean films that beat you over the head with messages). Sure enough, Fire Down Below does both. I find it hard to believe that there could be a person (Kris Kristofferson's villain) so cowardly & stupid that he dumps toxic waste in his home town's mountain range. As for the acting, Kristofferson is actually a good actor, but here he has no motivation for his actions. As for the preaching part, the film lays on the let's-look-after-the-environment message with all the subtlety of a kick to the groin. All of Seagal's films (including the dreck that Seagal made during the 2000s) have this concept of White Hat / Black Hat characters (the White Hat is Seagal, while the Black Hat is a really despicable villain). Of course this scripting idea first manifested itself during Seagal's debut film ABOVE THE LAW & continues in this one, with Kris Kristofferson's businessman being an evil coward who spends his working hours in the company of female escorts. The other actors are quite competent in their performances, especially Marg Helgenberger as the love interest (I kind of liked the idea to give her a shady past, but the film indifferently throws this away by making her brother turn out to have committed the deed) & Harry Dean Stanton (Brain from John Carpenter's ultra cool sci-fi classic ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), who gives a good impression as the hick local who proves to be Seagal's greatest asset.

    This is a marvelous film. The juxtaposition of a petite beekeeping blonde with a large muscular dark haired Federal good all round chap has not often been done better. Nuclear cyanide, a wimpy son and heir to a poisoning conglomerate added to the eclectic mix. Fast staging of semi-martial arts fights with quick quips about damaged wood sticks just about sealed it for me. Sadly I watched this film for the first time on the day that Levon Helm died. He died in the film, as the preacher. I could write some great stuff about Seven Seagulls as an actor and mock the film, but won't, out of respect for Mr. Helm.

    This film is different compared to Segals other films,it hardly has any action and they seem to be focused on the plot more, rather than the action.The plot of the movie is Steven segal plays a E.P.A. agent undercover as a maintenance man to investigate a corrupt company that has been dumping toxic waste in Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky. Most of the villains in this movie are country singers,Randy Travis has a cameo appearance.Segal falls in love with a woman everyone in the town dislikes named Sarah Kellog (Marge Hellenberger)because she was falsely accused of murdering her father when she was a child, it was actually her creepy brother Earl(Stephen Lang). This movie has a lot of humor and nice scenery of Kentucky.I would love to live in the south.

    Bad-Ass Steven Seagal Scores, Yet Again, in 'Fire Down Below'. An Ordinary Fare, that works mostly because of Seagal's charisma & honesty. 'Fire Down Below' Synopsis: An EPA agent investigates a Kentucky mine and helps locals stand up for their rights. 'Fire Down Below' is an ordinary fare. It barely offers anything new! Its a been-there-seen-that, done-with-it stuff, that doesn't even intend to leave its view spell-bound. Jeb Stuart & Phillip Morton's Screenplay is fairly engaging. F&eacute;lix Enr&iacute;quez Alcal&aacute;'s Direction is passable. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent. Seagal's an Eternal Bad-Ass & 'Fire Down Below' nods that fact right! His charisma & sheer honesty, is the sole reason to view this film. He's the scene-stealer here! On the whole, 'Fire Down Below' will work for Seagal Fans.

    The usual in Steven Seagal's movies take place in "Fire Down Below" too. He's the good guy again; the hero again; he's never got punched but he kicks and punches lots of guys with the little help of the editor who makes his moves even faster. This movie resembles "On Deadly Ground", so here we have Seagal saving the Earth of the bloody hands of powerful and corrupt business man who are destroying rivers, oceans and trees and all. The major difference between "Fire Down Below" and "On Deadly Ground" is the quality of the movie (for some reason I like "On Deadly...") and the violence/action. While action is dumb and so non breathtaking here, on the previous film was something great, although at times badly used or excessive, especially towards older people, it was literally no country for old men (e.g. the old friend of Seagal tortured and killed in 1994 film). In "Fire Down Below" the same thing happens but it is only implied, nothing is shown on screen and other times it's only a threat. In the story Seagal is a Environmental agent who goes to a little town in Kentucky investigate the murder of his friend who discovered that a powerful company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr. (Kris Kristofferson), is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft. With the assistance of a Reverend (Levon Helm) and a woman (Marg Helgenberger) and some other residents Segal is gonna find the truth and kicks some villains. The lack of action ruined this movie. The lack of violence ruined this movie. The lack of someone able to kick Seagal on the face ruined this and almost all Seagal's movies. The great vantage of this against "On Deadly Ground" is the quotes delivered by Seagal, funny things and for incredible as it might sound these quotes are not unintentionally laughable, they're there for the purpose of being funny. The scene in the casino when Seagal takes down 4 security guys trying to arrest Kristofferson is amazingly funny. I'll not say this was Seagal's worst film, but perhaps his performance was not good enough and the whole supporting cast was very effective and good compared to him. Marg Helgenberger was great, her part was very interesting as the forsaken woman of the town; Stephen Lang plays his usual sinister figure in a twisted character; Kristofferson was quite good and funny; and Levon Helm was the best on scene. The movie includes some bad acting from Brad Hunt (he plays the son of Kristofferson) whose presence is annoying, and some wasted acting by Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Masur (who appears in the beginning in some flashbacks), seriously they deserved a better flick to appear. Again, it is a movie to wait and wait again for action and it will be a few good things in it. Director Felix Enriquez Alcal&aacute; made better with the TV film remake of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three". 4/10

    love him or hate him,you have to admit,Steven Seagal's movies pretty much follow the same tried and true formula,which basically involves Seagal ending up on someone's bad side,and then proceeding to show off his martial arts prowess by beating up everybody in sight.well not everybody.just the bad people.this movie is no different.but hey,it works.it's nothing new or original.but if you're a Seagal fan,this should quench your thirst.like his previous movie,On Deadly Ground there's an environmental theme here too.Marg Helgenbberger(CSI Las Vegas)plays the love interest and does a good job with her character.Harry dean Stanton is also very good.There are also a lot of country stars in the movie,including Kris Kristofferson,who is very impressive.there are nice fight sequences in this one.for me,Fire Down Below is a 7/10

    An EPA agent Jack Taggart (Seagal) is sent to go "undercover" in eastern Kentucky to find out who's responsible for dumping toxins in the ground. Of course in a film like this, there's a friend of Taggart's who's dead, so he has to avenge him. The locals, mostly poor are too afraid to make much noise about who's doing it for fear of reprisals. So Taggart strolls into town and starts doing odd jobs for a church fixing up some local's porches, playing the fiddle and then meets the female lead Sarah Kellogg (Helgenberger). It's just as bad as it sounds. I like to the scene where he grabs the rattle snake lighting quick, I guess I'm not the only one who saw "Hard Target". Pretty soon he gets into fights with the local trash and as always dominates and finds out that Orin Hanner Sr. (Kristofferson) is the guy behind the whole operation. Taggart goes after his spineless son Orin Jr. (Hunt) who runs the business locally and eventually takes it to the top and sends Sr. to the big house in an anti climatic ending. This is one of Seagal's worst movies in my opinion. Even in films where the script was bad, Seagal usually would come through with some good fight sequences but even these are fairly lame in this. More often you are waiting for some action to actually happen, but rather you get to see Seagal glad hand the locals, sing, play guitars, square dance, give an environmental speech and do routine maintenance for the poor. Can you say stupid? The movie is boring and Seagal supposedly undercover stands out like sore thumb with those silly jackets. With the few action scenes you get, all are vastly inferior to those of his past greats and what kicks he had are very poor indeed. By this time in his career he was not in great shape and this may have affected the scenes in general. The best action scene in the film actually involves a big rig chasing him in truck like Red Fox's. To add to this, there is very little killing in this, not only does he push the environmental message, but he kills very few people. I mean come on, the staple of a film like this is the showdown at the end and the bad guy bites it. But no Seagal wounds the guy and arrests him. And don't even get me started with the gas station and the flare, didn't want to hurt any bystanders I suppose. WEAK! There are plenty of fine actors in this film, not really sure why, who also come out looking thoroughly awful. Nobody usually expects fine acting from a film like this, but good actors can only do so much with a terrible script and this proves good actors can be totally wasted on poor writing. Harry Dean Stanton is great and he has such a weak hillbilly role in this, along with Helgenberger. And of course Seagal speaks as always painfully low toned and silly, like he's on depressants. If your fan of The Punisher look for Mark Collie playing a hick who can't fight. Also once Seagal started putting into his films too much of an environmental message the movies began to go down hill. Believe me, I'm for the environment, but it has very little place in these films and Seagal looks like a fool doing speeches on the subject, remember On Deadly Ground? This is worse. There very few bright spots, one being the location shots. OK nice, but I came to see action not Kentucky. For country music fans I would imagine this is a gold mine, with lots of music and stars making appearances in the films. Again, didn't come to see that. With a few one liners that are OK, there is nothing much more to say that is good. Surprisingly this was released in theaters and I can see why it was one of his last. Overall a very poor action film, with no nudity to speak of equals 1 out of 10 stars.

    I watched "Fire Down Below" on a twelve-hours coach trip to Paris, in double bill with "The Sixth Sense" (go figure). Despite Steven Seagal's colourful jackets, this is actually a very entertaining action film. In my humble opinion, two things make it recommendable. The first is the heroine, excellently played by Marg Helbenberg, who brings lots of humanity to her character. It is a pity she did not have a more expressive actor to react to her (although Seagal is good in the action bits which, after all, are his thing). The second (and foremost) is the last scene, the one with Harry Dean Stanton singing and dancing in his newly built porch. Stanton (especially remembered for "Paris, Texas")is one of those actors who have been there for ages but never became a star, whose face is familiar but whose name escapes us. The scene reminds me of that character in "The Searchers", who only wanted "a rocking chair in a porch" in his old age. It is an homage to a veteran actor, a secondary in hundreds of classic westerns and also an accomplished musician. Watching him play "Kentucky Waltz" made me wish the credits rolled forever. A 6 for the film and a 10 for this scene.

    Plot Synopsis: Jack Taggart, an agent working for the EPA, is shocked to discover that his best friend & fellow agent has been killed while investigating reports of people in a rural town in Kentucky getting sick.

Faced with a wall of silence in the town & the presence of the dumpers, Jack attempts to expose the dumping & prosecute the people responsible. Film Review: Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers  Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death. As for Steven Seagal, the real-life aikido master, police officer (I'm serious), blues musician & actor (I was going to include CIA agent in that list of achievements but I'm not exactly sure if Seagal ever worked for the agency for real), he tried to reinvent himself as an environmental activist, making a trilogy of films in the mid-to-late 1990s that were eco-thrillers (ON DEADLY GROUND, Fire Down Below & The Patriot) at least in basic plot thematics, that is.

    Bad-Ass Steven Seagal Scores, Yet Again, in 'Fire Down Below'. An Ordinary Fare, that works mostly because of Seagal's charisma & honesty. 'Fire Down Below' Synopsis: An EPA agent investigates a Kentucky mine and helps locals stand up for their rights. 'Fire Down Below' is an ordinary fare. It barely offers anything new! Its a been-there-seen-that, done-with-it stuff, that doesn't even intend to leave its view spell-bound. Jeb Stuart & Phillip Morton's Screenplay is fairly engaging. F&eacute;lix Enr&iacute;quez Alcal&aacute;'s Direction is passable. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent. Seagal's an Eternal Bad-Ass & 'Fire Down Below' nods that fact right! His charisma & sheer honesty, is the sole reason to view this film. He's the scene-stealer here! On the whole, 'Fire Down Below' will work for Seagal Fans.

    The usual in Steven Seagal's movies take place in "Fire Down Below" too. He's the good guy again; the hero again; he's never got punched but he kicks and punches lots of guys with the little help of the editor who makes his moves even faster. This movie resembles "On Deadly Ground", so here we have Seagal saving the Earth of the bloody hands of powerful and corrupt business man who are destroying rivers, oceans and trees and all. The major difference between "Fire Down Below" and "On Deadly Ground" is the quality of the movie (for some reason I like "On Deadly...") and the violence/action. While action is dumb and so non breathtaking here, on the previous film was something great, although at times badly used or excessive, especially towards older people, it was literally no country for old men (e.g. the old friend of Seagal tortured and killed in 1994 film). In "Fire Down Below" the same thing happens but it is only implied, nothing is shown on screen and other times it's only a threat. In the story Seagal is a Environmental agent who goes to a little town in Kentucky investigate the murder of his friend who discovered that a powerful company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr. (Kris Kristofferson), is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft. With the assistance of a Reverend (Levon Helm) and a woman (Marg Helgenberger) and some other residents Segal is gonna find the truth and kicks some villains. The lack of action ruined this movie. The lack of violence ruined this movie. The lack of someone able to kick Seagal on the face ruined this and almost all Seagal's movies. The great vantage of this against "On Deadly Ground" is the quotes delivered by Seagal, funny things and for incredible as it might sound these quotes are not unintentionally laughable, they're there for the purpose of being funny. The scene in the casino when Seagal takes down 4 security guys trying to arrest Kristofferson is amazingly funny. I'll not say this was Seagal's worst film, but perhaps his performance was not good enough and the whole supporting cast was very effective and good compared to him. Marg Helgenberger was great, her part was very interesting as the forsaken woman of the town; Stephen Lang plays his usual sinister figure in a twisted character; Kristofferson was quite good and funny; and Levon Helm was the best on scene. The movie includes some bad acting from Brad Hunt (he plays the son of Kristofferson) whose presence is annoying, and some wasted acting by Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Masur (who appears in the beginning in some flashbacks), seriously they deserved a better flick to appear. Again, it is a movie to wait and wait again for action and it will be a few good things in it. Director Felix Enriquez Alcal&aacute; made better with the TV film remake of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three". 4/10

    love him or hate him,you have to admit,Steven Seagal's movies pretty much follow the same tried and true formula,which basically involves Seagal ending up on someone's bad side,and then proceeding to show off his martial arts prowess by beating up everybody in sight.well not everybody.just the bad people.this movie is no different.but hey,it works.it's nothing new or original.but if you're a Seagal fan,this should quench your thirst.like his previous movie,On Deadly Ground there's an environmental theme here too.Marg Helgenbberger(CSI Las Vegas)plays the love interest and does a good job with her character.Harry dean Stanton is also very good.There are also a lot of country stars in the movie,including Kris Kristofferson,who is very impressive.there are nice fight sequences in this one.for me,Fire Down Below is a 7/10

    An EPA agent Jack Taggart (Seagal) is sent to go "undercover" in eastern Kentucky to find out who's responsible for dumping toxins in the ground. Of course in a film like this, there's a friend of Taggart's who's dead, so he has to avenge him. The locals, mostly poor are too afraid to make much noise about who's doing it for fear of reprisals. So Taggart strolls into town and starts doing odd jobs for a church fixing up some local's porches, playing the fiddle and then meets the female lead Sarah Kellogg (Helgenberger). It's just as bad as it sounds. I like to the scene where he grabs the rattle snake lighting quick, I guess I'm not the only one who saw "Hard Target". Pretty soon he gets into fights with the local trash and as always dominates and finds out that Orin Hanner Sr. (Kristofferson) is the guy behind the whole operation. Taggart goes after his spineless son Orin Jr. (Hunt) who runs the business locally and eventually takes it to the top and sends Sr. to the big house in an anti climatic ending. This is one of Seagal's worst movies in my opinion. Even in films where the script was bad, Seagal usually would come through with some good fight sequences but even these are fairly lame in this. More often you are waiting for some action to actually happen, but rather you get to see Seagal glad hand the locals, sing, play guitars, square dance, give an environmental speech and do routine maintenance for the poor. Can you say stupid? The movie is boring and Seagal supposedly undercover stands out like sore thumb with those silly jackets. With the few action scenes you get, all are vastly inferior to those of his past greats and what kicks he had are very poor indeed. By this time in his career he was not in great shape and this may have affected the scenes in general. The best action scene in the film actually involves a big rig chasing him in truck like Red Fox's. To add to this, there is very little killing in this, not only does he push the environmental message, but he kills very few people. I mean come on, the staple of a film like this is the showdown at the end and the bad guy bites it. But no Seagal wounds the guy and arrests him. And don't even get me started with the gas station and the flare, didn't want to hurt any bystanders I suppose. WEAK! There are plenty of fine actors in this film, not really sure why, who also come out looking thoroughly awful. Nobody usually expects fine acting from a film like this, but good actors can only do so much with a terrible script and this proves good actors can be totally wasted on poor writing. Harry Dean Stanton is great and he has such a weak hillbilly role in this, along with Helgenberger. And of course Seagal speaks as always painfully low toned and silly, like he's on depressants. If your fan of The Punisher look for Mark Collie playing a hick who can't fight. Also once Seagal started putting into his films too much of an environmental message the movies began to go down hill. Believe me, I'm for the environment, but it has very little place in these films and Seagal looks like a fool doing speeches on the subject, remember On Deadly Ground? This is worse. There very few bright spots, one being the location shots. OK nice, but I came to see action not Kentucky. For country music fans I would imagine this is a gold mine, with lots of music and stars making appearances in the films. Again, didn't come to see that. With a few one liners that are OK, there is nothing much more to say that is good. Surprisingly this was released in theaters and I can see why it was one of his last. Overall a very poor action film, with no nudity to speak of equals 1 out of 10 stars.

    Here's another attempt from Seagal to send a important message to the world  be careful with the environment . And it's just as wonderful as "On deadly ground" . It's not a bad thing when you're trying to say something important. It's bad when you fail to both entertain and send a message. The message here seems sincere , but it's too preachy just like in "ODG" . What is more important is for an action movie "FDB" sucks . The shootouts and car chases are badly edited. You can't see a thing ! Same goes for fight scenes . There is one fight scene at the beginning of the movie  Seagal fights with few opponents . He beats down one of them , then he defeats second one , then he punches the guy THAT WAS DEFEATED AS FIRST AND LYING UNCONSCIOUS ON GROUND , then he defeats the third one . Talk about bad montage The movie also tries to put Seagal in believable romantic story , but it fails just as always. The only thing good here is the guitar music . Anyway , this is a really bad movie . Second in Seagal's "save the environment trilogy " ( The trilogy includes "On deadly ground" , "Fire down below" and "The Patriot" ). I give it 1/10.

    A bland eco-muddle that fails to settle on a genre. The gear-shifting mixture of romance, action, drama and environmental preaching just doesn't work, and it's not made any more successful by Steven Seagal's rubbish performance, which consists of his usual frowning routine with a hint of constipation and a touch of whispery woodenness. He seems to be acting in a completely different film to the rest of the cast and constantly undermines the sparks of interest that pop up from time to time. This well-intentioned but flat movie trundles along painlessly for 100 minutes or so while the small-town-versus-rich-boss clich&eacute;s pile up around everyone's feet, then Harry Dean Stanton sings a song, and that's that.

    I watched "Fire Down Below" on a twelve-hours coach trip to Paris, in double bill with "The Sixth Sense" (go figure). Despite Steven Seagal's colourful jackets, this is actually a very entertaining action film. In my humble opinion, two things make it recommendable. The first is the heroine, excellently played by Marg Helbenberg, who brings lots of humanity to her character. It is a pity she did not have a more expressive actor to react to her (although Seagal is good in the action bits which, after all, are his thing). The second (and foremost) is the last scene, the one with Harry Dean Stanton singing and dancing in his newly built porch. Stanton (especially remembered for "Paris, Texas")is one of those actors who have been there for ages but never became a star, whose face is familiar but whose name escapes us. The scene reminds me of that character in "The Searchers", who only wanted "a rocking chair in a porch" in his old age. It is an homage to a veteran actor, a secondary in hundreds of classic westerns and also an accomplished musician. Watching him play "Kentucky Waltz" made me wish the credits rolled forever. A 6 for the film and a 10 for this scene.

    Plot Synopsis: Jack Taggart, an agent working for the EPA, is shocked to discover that his best friend & fellow agent has been killed while investigating reports of people in a rural town in Kentucky getting sick. Posing as a church mission carpenter, he visits the town, uncovering a conspiracy to dump toxic waste in the abandoned coal mines in the nearby mountains by Orin Hanner, a shady businessman whose son runs the town. Faced with a wall of silence in the town & the presence of the dumpers, Jack attempts to expose the dumping & prosecute the people responsible. Film Review: Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers  Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death. As for Steven Seagal, the real-life aikido master, police officer (I'm serious), blues musician & actor (I was going to include CIA agent in that list of achievements but I'm not exactly sure if Seagal ever worked for the agency for real), he tried to reinvent himself as an environmental activist, making a trilogy of films in the mid-to-late 1990s that were eco-thrillers (ON DEADLY GROUND, Fire Down Below & The Patriot) at least in basic plot thematics, that is. Excepting On Deadly Ground, these pro-environment films almost killed Seagal's career stone dead, mainly due to being ridiculously heavy-handed  the villains are all very shrill one-dimensional cardboard cutouts & clich&eacute;s; the scripts are poorly written; & the most serious flaw of all  the action scenes are poorly staged. Fire Down Below starts out in a way that seems to indicate that Seagal is planning to forsake his customary martial arts sequences for some good old fashioned investigative skills. Not counting the short scene where Seagal stumbles onto a cannabis hydroponics farm, there seems to be a lack of anything that even remotely resembles the sort of brutal martial arts fights that Seagal's early films had showcased. But shortly after it starts, the film degenerates into a muddled blend of one-dimensional stereotypes, tepid car chases & poorly-choreographed fight scenes. There are two things I hate while watching films  having my intelligence insulted & being preached to (by that I don't mean social commentaries or satire  I mean films that beat you over the head with messages). Sure enough, Fire Down Below does both. I find it hard to believe that there could be a person (Kris Kristofferson's villain) so cowardly & stupid that he dumps toxic waste in his home town's mountain range. As for the acting, Kristofferson is actually a good actor, but here he has no motivation for his actions. As for the preaching part, the film lays on the let's-look-after-the-environment message with all the subtlety of a kick to the groin. All of Seagal's films (including the dreck that Seagal made during the 2000s) have this concept of White Hat / Black Hat characters (the White Hat is Seagal, while the Black Hat is a really despicable villain). Of course this scripting idea first manifested itself during Seagal's debut film ABOVE THE LAW & continues in this one, with Kris Kristofferson's businessman being an evil coward who spends his working hours in the company of female escorts. The other actors are quite competent in their performances, especially Marg Helgenberger as the love interest (I kind of liked the idea to give her a shady past, but the film indifferently throws this away by making her brother turn out to have committed the deed) & Harry Dean Stanton (Brain from John Carpenter's ultra cool sci-fi classic ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), who gives a good impression as the hick local who proves to be Seagal's greatest asset.

    This is a marvelous film. The juxtaposition of a petite beekeeping blonde with a large muscular dark haired Federal good all round chap has not often been done better. Nuclear cyanide, a wimpy son and heir to a poisoning conglomerate added to the eclectic mix. Fast staging of semi-martial arts fights with quick quips about damaged wood sticks just about sealed it for me. Sadly I watched this film for the first time on the day that Levon Helm died. He died in the film, as the preacher. I could write some great stuff about Seven Seagulls as an actor and mock the film, but won't, out of respect for Mr. Helm.

    This film is different compared to Segals other films,it hardly has any action and they seem to be focused on the plot more, rather than the action.The plot of the movie is Steven segal plays a E.P.A. agent undercover as a maintenance man to investigate a corrupt company that has been dumping toxic waste in Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky. Most of the villains in this movie are country singers,Randy Travis has a cameo appearance.Segal falls in love with a woman everyone in the town dislikes named Sarah Kellog (Marge Hellenberger)because she was falsely accused of murdering her father when she was a child, it was actually her creepy brother Earl(Stephen Lang). This movie has a lot of humor and nice scenery of Kentucky.I would love to live in the south.

    I watched "Fire Down Below" on a twelve-hours coach trip to Paris, in double bill with "The Sixth Sense" (go figure). Despite Steven Seagal's colourful jackets, this is actually a very entertaining action film. In my humble opinion, two things make it recommendable. The first is the heroine, excellently played by Marg Helbenberg, who brings lots of humanity to her character. It is a pity she did not have a more expressive actor to react to her (although Seagal is good in the action bits which, after all, are his thing). The second (and foremost) is the last scene, the one with Harry Dean Stanton singing and dancing in his newly built porch. Stanton (especially remembered for "Paris, Texas")is one of those actors who have been there for ages but never became a star, whose face is familiar but whose name escapes us. The scene reminds me of that character in "The Searchers", who only wanted "a rocking chair in a porch" in his old age. It is an homage to a veteran actor, a secondary in hundreds of classic westerns and also an accomplished musician. Watching him play "Kentucky Waltz" made me wish the credits rolled forever. A 6 for the film and a 10 for this scene.

    Plot Synopsis: Jack Taggart, an agent working for the EPA, is shocked to discover that his best friend & fellow agent has been killed while investigating reports of people in a rural town in Kentucky getting sick. Posing as a church mission carpenter, he visits the town, uncovering a conspiracy to dump toxic waste in the abandoned coal mines in the nearby mountains by Orin Hanner, a shady businessman whose son runs the town. Faced with a wall of silence in the town & the presence of the dumpers, Jack attempts to expose the dumping & prosecute the people responsible. Film Review: Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers  Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death. As for Steven Seagal, the real-life aikido master, police officer (I'm serious), blues musician & actor (I was going to include CIA agent in that list of achievements but I'm not exactly sure if Seagal ever worked for the agency for real), he tried to reinvent himself as an environmental activist, making a trilogy of films in the mid-to-late 1990s that were eco-thrillers (ON DEADLY GROUND, Fire Down Below & The Patriot) at least in basic plot thematics, that is. Excepting On Deadly Ground, these pro-environment films almost killed Seagal's career stone dead, mainly due to being ridiculously heavy-handed  the villains are all very shrill one-dimensional cardboard cutouts & clich&eacute;s; the scripts are poorly written; & the most serious flaw of all  the action scenes are poorly staged. Fire Down Below starts out in a way that seems to indicate that Seagal is planning to forsake his customary martial arts sequences for some good old fashioned investigative skills. Not counting the short scene where Seagal stumbles onto a cannabis hydroponics farm, there seems to be a lack of anything that even remotely resembles the sort of brutal martial arts fights that Seagal's early films had showcased. But shortly after it starts, the film degenerates into a muddled blend of one-dimensional stereotypes, tepid car chases & poorly-choreographed fight scenes. There are two things I hate while watching films  having my intelligence insulted & being preached to (by that I don't mean social commentaries or satire  I mean films that beat you over the head with messages). Sure enough, Fire Down Below does both. I find it hard to believe that there could be a person (Kris Kristofferson's villain) so cowardly & stupid that he dumps toxic waste in his home town's mountain range. As for the acting, Kristofferson is actually a good actor, but here he has no motivation for his actions. As for the preaching part, the film lays on the let's-look-after-the-environment message with all the subtlety of a kick to the groin. All of Seagal's films (including the dreck that Seagal made during the 2000s) have this concept of White Hat / Black Hat characters (the White Hat is Seagal, while the Black Hat is a really despicable villain). Of course this scripting idea first manifested itself during Seagal's debut film ABOVE THE LAW & continues in this one, with Kris Kristofferson's businessman being an evil coward who spends his working hours in the company of female escorts. The other actors are quite competent in their performances, especially Marg Helgenberger as the love interest (I kind of liked the idea to give her a shady past, but the film indifferently throws this away by making her brother turn out to have committed the deed) & Harry Dean Stanton (Brain from John Carpenter's ultra cool sci-fi classic ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), who gives a good impression as the hick local who proves to be Seagal's greatest asset.

    This is a marvelous film. The juxtaposition of a petite beekeeping blonde with a large muscular dark haired Federal good all round chap has not often been done better. Nuclear cyanide, a wimpy son and heir to a poisoning conglomerate added to the eclectic mix. Fast staging of semi-martial arts fights with quick quips about damaged wood sticks just about sealed it for me. Sadly I watched this film for the first time on the day that Levon Helm died. He died in the film, as the preacher. I could write some great stuff about Seven Seagulls as an actor and mock the film, but won't, out of respect for Mr. Helm.

    This film is different compared to Segals other films,it hardly has any action and they seem to be focused on the plot more, rather than the action.The plot of the movie is Steven segal plays a E.P.A. agent undercover as a maintenance man to investigate a corrupt company that has been dumping toxic waste in Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky. Most of the villains in this movie are country singers,Randy Travis has a cameo appearance.Segal falls in love with a woman everyone in the town dislikes named Sarah Kellog (Marge Hellenberger)because she was falsely accused of murdering her father when she was a child, it was actually her creepy brother Earl(Stephen Lang). This movie has a lot of humor and nice scenery of Kentucky.I would love to live in the south.

    Bad-Ass Steven Seagal Scores, Yet Again, in 'Fire Down Below'. An Ordinary Fare, that works mostly because of Seagal's charisma & honesty. 'Fire Down Below' Synopsis: An EPA agent investigates a Kentucky mine and helps locals stand up for their rights. 'Fire Down Below' is an ordinary fare. It barely offers anything new! Its a been-there-seen-that, done-with-it stuff, that doesn't even intend to leave its view spell-bound. Jeb Stuart & Phillip Morton's Screenplay is fairly engaging. F&eacute;lix Enr&iacute;quez Alcal&aacute;'s Direction is passable. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent. Seagal's an Eternal Bad-Ass & 'Fire Down Below' nods that fact right! His charisma & sheer honesty, is the sole reason to view this film. He's the scene-stealer here! On the whole, 'Fire Down Below' will work for Seagal Fans.

    The usual in Steven Seagal's movies take place in "Fire Down Below" too. He's the good guy again; the hero again; he's never got punched but he kicks and punches lots of guys with the little help of the editor who makes his moves even faster. This movie resembles "On Deadly Ground", so here we have Seagal saving the Earth of the bloody hands of powerful and corrupt business man who are destroying rivers, oceans and trees and all. The major difference between "Fire Down Below" and "On Deadly Ground" is the quality of the movie (for some reason I like "On Deadly...") and the violence/action. While action is dumb and so non breathtaking here, on the previous film was something great, although at times badly used or excessive, especially towards older people, it was literally no country for old men (e.g. the old friend of Seagal tortured and killed in 1994 film). In "Fire Down Below" the same thing happens but it is only implied, nothing is shown on screen and other times it's only a threat. In the story Seagal is a Environmental agent who goes to a little town in Kentucky investigate the murder of his friend who discovered that a powerful company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr. (Kris Kristofferson), is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft. With the assistance of a Reverend (Levon Helm) and a woman (Marg Helgenberger) and some other residents Segal is gonna find the truth and kicks some villains. The lack of action ruined this movie. The lack of violence ruined this movie. The lack of someone able to kick Seagal on the face ruined this and almost all Seagal's movies. The great vantage of this against "On Deadly Ground" is the quotes delivered by Seagal, funny things and for incredible as it might sound these quotes are not unintentionally laughable, they're there for the purpose of being funny. The scene in the casino when Seagal takes down 4 security guys trying to arrest Kristofferson is amazingly funny. I'll not say this was Seagal's worst film, but perhaps his performance was not good enough and the whole supporting cast was very effective and good compared to him. Marg Helgenberger was great, her part was very interesting as the forsaken woman of the town; Stephen Lang plays his usual sinister figure in a twisted character; Kristofferson was quite good and funny; and Levon Helm was the best on scene. The movie includes some bad acting from Brad Hunt (he plays the son of Kristofferson) whose presence is annoying, and some wasted acting by Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Masur (who appears in the beginning in some flashbacks), seriously they deserved a better flick to appear. Again, it is a movie to wait and wait again for action and it will be a few good things in it. Director Felix Enriquez Alcal&aacute; made better with the TV film remake of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three". 4/10

    love him or hate him,you have to admit,Steven Seagal's movies pretty much follow the same tried and true formula,which basically involves Seagal ending up on someone's bad side,and then proceeding to show off his martial arts prowess by beating up everybody in sight.well not everybody.just the bad people.this movie is no different.but hey,it works.it's nothing new or original.but if you're a Seagal fan,this should quench your thirst.like his previous movie,On Deadly Ground there's an environmental theme here too.Marg Helgenbberger(CSI Las Vegas)plays the love interest and does a good job with her character.Harry dean Stanton is also very good.There are also a lot of country stars in the movie,including Kris Kristofferson,who is very impressive.there are nice fight sequences in this one.for me,Fire Down Below is a 7/10

    An EPA agent Jack Taggart (Seagal) is sent to go "undercover" in eastern Kentucky to find out who's responsible for dumping toxins in the ground. Of course in a film like this, there's a friend of Taggart's who's dead, so he has to avenge him. The locals, mostly poor are too afraid to make much noise about who's doing it for fear of reprisals. So Taggart strolls into town and starts doing odd jobs for a church fixing up some local's porches, playing the fiddle and then meets the female lead Sarah Kellogg (Helgenberger). It's just as bad as it sounds. I like to the scene where he grabs the rattle snake lighting quick, I guess I'm not the only one who saw "Hard Target". Pretty soon he gets into fights with the local trash and as always dominates and finds out that Orin Hanner Sr. (Kristofferson) is the guy behind the whole operation. Taggart goes after his spineless son Orin Jr. (Hunt) who runs the business locally and eventually takes it to the top and sends Sr. to the big house in an anti climatic ending. This is one of Seagal's worst movies in my opinion. Even in films where the script was bad, Seagal usually would come through with some good fight sequences but even these are fairly lame in this. More often you are waiting for some action to actually happen, but rather you get to see Seagal glad hand the locals, sing, play guitars, square dance, give an environmental speech and do routine maintenance for the poor. Can you say stupid? The movie is boring and Seagal supposedly undercover stands out like sore thumb with those silly jackets. With the few action scenes you get, all are vastly inferior to those of his past greats and what kicks he had are very poor indeed. By this time in his career he was not in great shape and this may have affected the scenes in general. The best action scene in the film actually involves a big rig chasing him in truck like Red Fox's. To add to this, there is very little killing in this, not only does he push the environmental message, but he kills very few people. I mean come on, the staple of a film like this is the showdown at the end and the bad guy bites it. But no Seagal wounds the guy and arrests him. And don't even get me started with the gas station and the flare, didn't want to hurt any bystanders I suppose. WEAK! There are plenty of fine actors in this film, not really sure why, who also come out looking thoroughly awful. Nobody usually expects fine acting from a film like this, but good actors can only do so much with a terrible script and this proves good actors can be totally wasted on poor writing. Harry Dean Stanton is great and he has such a weak hillbilly role in this, along with Helgenberger. And of course Seagal speaks as always painfully low toned and silly, like he's on depressants. If your fan of The Punisher look for Mark Collie playing a hick who can't fight. Also once Seagal started putting into his films too much of an environmental message the movies began to go down hill. Believe me, I'm for the environment, but it has very little place in these films and Seagal looks like a fool doing speeches on the subject, remember On Deadly Ground? This is worse. There very few bright spots, one being the location shots. OK nice, but I came to see action not Kentucky. For country music fans I would imagine this is a gold mine, with lots of music and stars making appearances in the films. Again, didn't come to see that. With a few one liners that are OK, there is nothing much more to say that is good. Surprisingly this was released in theaters and I can see why it was one of his last. Overall a very poor action film, with no nudity to speak of equals 1 out of 10 stars.

    Here's another attempt from Seagal to send a important message to the world  be careful with the environment . And it's just as wonderful as "On deadly ground" . It's not a bad thing when you're trying to say something important. It's bad when you fail to both entertain and send a message. The message here seems sincere , but it's too preachy just like in "ODG" . What is more important is for an action movie "FDB" sucks . The shootouts and car chases are badly edited. You can't see a thing ! Same goes for fight scenes . There is one fight scene at the beginning of the movie  Seagal fights with few opponents . He beats down one of them , then he defeats second one , then he punches the guy THAT WAS DEFEATED AS FIRST AND LYING UNCONSCIOUS ON GROUND , then he defeats the third one . Talk about bad montage The movie also tries to put Seagal in believable romantic story , but it fails just as always. The only thing good here is the guitar music . Anyway , this is a really bad movie . Second in Seagal's "save the environment trilogy " ( The trilogy includes "On deadly ground" , "Fire down below" and "The Patriot" ). I give it 1/10.

    A bland eco-muddle that fails to settle on a genre. The gear-shifting mixture of romance, action, drama and environmental preaching just doesn't work, and it's not made any more successful by Steven Seagal's rubbish performance, which consists of his usual frowning routine with a hint of constipation and a touch of whispery woodenness. He seems to be acting in a completely different film to the rest of the cast and constantly undermines the sparks of interest that pop up from time to time. This well-intentioned but flat movie trundles along painlessly for 100 minutes or so while the small-town-versus-rich-boss clich&eacute;s pile up around everyone's feet, then Harry Dean Stanton sings a song, and that's that.

Film Review: Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers  Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death.

    love him or hate him,you have to admit,Steven Seagal's movies pretty much follow the same tried and true formula,which basically involves Seagal ending up on someone's bad side,and then proceeding to show off his martial arts prowess by beating up everybody in sight.well not everybody.just the bad people.this movie is no different.but hey,it works.it's nothing new or original.but if you're a Seagal fan,this should quench your thirst.like his previous movie,On Deadly Ground there's an environmental theme here too.Marg Helgenbberger(CSI Las Vegas)plays the love interest and does a good job with her character.Harry dean Stanton is also very good.There are also a lot of country stars in the movie,including Kris Kristofferson,who is very impressive.there are nice fight sequences in this one.for me,Fire Down Below is a 7/10

    An EPA agent Jack Taggart (Seagal) is sent to go "undercover" in eastern Kentucky to find out who's responsible for dumping toxins in the ground. Of course in a film like this, there's a friend of Taggart's who's dead, so he has to avenge him. The locals, mostly poor are too afraid to make much noise about who's doing it for fear of reprisals. So Taggart strolls into town and starts doing odd jobs for a church fixing up some local's porches, playing the fiddle and then meets the female lead Sarah Kellogg (Helgenberger). It's just as bad as it sounds. I like to the scene where he grabs the rattle snake lighting quick, I guess I'm not the only one who saw "Hard Target". Pretty soon he gets into fights with the local trash and as always dominates and finds out that Orin Hanner Sr. (Kristofferson) is the guy behind the whole operation. Taggart goes after his spineless son Orin Jr. (Hunt) who runs the business locally and eventually takes it to the top and sends Sr. to the big house in an anti climatic ending. This is one of Seagal's worst movies in my opinion. Even in films where the script was bad, Seagal usually would come through with some good fight sequences but even these are fairly lame in this. More often you are waiting for some action to actually happen, but rather you get to see Seagal glad hand the locals, sing, play guitars, square dance, give an environmental speech and do routine maintenance for the poor. Can you say stupid? The movie is boring and Seagal supposedly undercover stands out like sore thumb with those silly jackets. With the few action scenes you get, all are vastly inferior to those of his past greats and what kicks he had are very poor indeed. By this time in his career he was not in great shape and this may have affected the scenes in general. The best action scene in the film actually involves a big rig chasing him in truck like Red Fox's. To add to this, there is very little killing in this, not only does he push the environmental message, but he kills very few people. I mean come on, the staple of a film like this is the showdown at the end and the bad guy bites it. But no Seagal wounds the guy and arrests him. And don't even get me started with the gas station and the flare, didn't want to hurt any bystanders I suppose. WEAK! There are plenty of fine actors in this film, not really sure why, who also come out looking thoroughly awful. Nobody usually expects fine acting from a film like this, but good actors can only do so much with a terrible script and this proves good actors can be totally wasted on poor writing. Harry Dean Stanton is great and he has such a weak hillbilly role in this, along with Helgenberger. And of course Seagal speaks as always painfully low toned and silly, like he's on depressants. If your fan of The Punisher look for Mark Collie playing a hick who can't fight. Also once Seagal started putting into his films too much of an environmental message the movies began to go down hill. Believe me, I'm for the environment, but it has very little place in these films and Seagal looks like a fool doing speeches on the subject, remember On Deadly Ground? This is worse. There very few bright spots, one being the location shots. OK nice, but I came to see action not Kentucky. For country music fans I would imagine this is a gold mine, with lots of music and stars making appearances in the films. Again, didn't come to see that. With a few one liners that are OK, there is nothing much more to say that is good. Surprisingly this was released in theaters and I can see why it was one of his last. Overall a very poor action film, with no nudity to speak of equals 1 out of 10 stars.

    Here's another attempt from Seagal to send a important message to the world  be careful with the environment . And it's just as wonderful as "On deadly ground" . It's not a bad thing when you're trying to say something important. It's bad when you fail to both entertain and send a message. The message here seems sincere , but it's too preachy just like in "ODG" . What is more important is for an action movie "FDB" sucks . The shootouts and car chases are badly edited. You can't see a thing ! Same goes for fight scenes . There is one fight scene at the beginning of the movie  Seagal fights with few opponents . He beats down one of them , then he defeats second one , then he punches the guy THAT WAS DEFEATED AS FIRST AND LYING UNCONSCIOUS ON GROUND , then he defeats the third one . Talk about bad montage The movie also tries to put Seagal in believable romantic story , but it fails just as always. The only thing good here is the guitar music . Anyway , this is a really bad movie . Second in Seagal's "save the environment trilogy " ( The trilogy includes "On deadly ground" , "Fire down below" and "The Patriot" ). I give it 1/10.

    A bland eco-muddle that fails to settle on a genre. The gear-shifting mixture of romance, action, drama and environmental preaching just doesn't work, and it's not made any more successful by Steven Seagal's rubbish performance, which consists of his usual frowning routine with a hint of constipation and a touch of whispery woodenness. He seems to be acting in a completely different film to the rest of the cast and constantly undermines the sparks of interest that pop up from time to time. This well-intentioned but flat movie trundles along painlessly for 100 minutes or so while the small-town-versus-rich-boss clich&eacute;s pile up around everyone's feet, then Harry Dean Stanton sings a song, and that's that.

    I watched "Fire Down Below" on a twelve-hours coach trip to Paris, in double bill with "The Sixth Sense" (go figure). Despite Steven Seagal's colourful jackets, this is actually a very entertaining action film. In my humble opinion, two things make it recommendable. The first is the heroine, excellently played by Marg Helbenberg, who brings lots of humanity to her character. It is a pity she did not have a more expressive actor to react to her (although Seagal is good in the action bits which, after all, are his thing). The second (and foremost) is the last scene, the one with Harry Dean Stanton singing and dancing in his newly built porch. Stanton (especially remembered for "Paris, Texas")is one of those actors who have been there for ages but never became a star, whose face is familiar but whose name escapes us. The scene reminds me of that character in "The Searchers", who only wanted "a rocking chair in a porch" in his old age. It is an homage to a veteran actor, a secondary in hundreds of classic westerns and also an accomplished musician. Watching him play "Kentucky Waltz" made me wish the credits rolled forever. A 6 for the film and a 10 for this scene.

    Plot Synopsis: Jack Taggart, an agent working for the EPA, is shocked to discover that his best friend & fellow agent has been killed while investigating reports of people in a rural town in Kentucky getting sick. Posing as a church mission carpenter, he visits the town, uncovering a conspiracy to dump toxic waste in the abandoned coal mines in the nearby mountains by Orin Hanner, a shady businessman whose son runs the town. Faced with a wall of silence in the town & the presence of the dumpers, Jack attempts to expose the dumping & prosecute the people responsible. Film Review: Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers  Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death. As for Steven Seagal, the real-life aikido master, police officer (I'm serious), blues musician & actor (I was going to include CIA agent in that list of achievements but I'm not exactly sure if Seagal ever worked for the agency for real), he tried to reinvent himself as an environmental activist, making a trilogy of films in the mid-to-late 1990s that were eco-thrillers (ON DEADLY GROUND, Fire Down Below & The Patriot) at least in basic plot thematics, that is. Excepting On Deadly Ground, these pro-environment films almost killed Seagal's career stone dead, mainly due to being ridiculously heavy-handed  the villains are all very shrill one-dimensional cardboard cutouts & clich&eacute;s; the scripts are poorly written; & the most serious flaw of all  the action scenes are poorly staged. Fire Down Below starts out in a way that seems to indicate that Seagal is planning to forsake his customary martial arts sequences for some good old fashioned investigative skills. Not counting the short scene where Seagal stumbles onto a cannabis hydroponics farm, there seems to be a lack of anything that even remotely resembles the sort of brutal martial arts fights that Seagal's early films had showcased. But shortly after it starts, the film degenerates into a muddled blend of one-dimensional stereotypes, tepid car chases & poorly-choreographed fight scenes. There are two things I hate while watching films  having my intelligence insulted & being preached to (by that I don't mean social commentaries or satire  I mean films that beat you over the head with messages). Sure enough, Fire Down Below does both. I find it hard to believe that there could be a person (Kris Kristofferson's villain) so cowardly & stupid that he dumps toxic waste in his home town's mountain range. As for the acting, Kristofferson is actually a good actor, but here he has no motivation for his actions. As for the preaching part, the film lays on the let's-look-after-the-environment message with all the subtlety of a kick to the groin. All of Seagal's films (including the dreck that Seagal made during the 2000s) have this concept of White Hat / Black Hat characters (the White Hat is Seagal, while the Black Hat is a really despicable villain). Of course this scripting idea first manifested itself during Seagal's debut film ABOVE THE LAW & continues in this one, with Kris Kristofferson's businessman being an evil coward who spends his working hours in the company of female escorts. The other actors are quite competent in their performances, especially Marg Helgenberger as the love interest (I kind of liked the idea to give her a shady past, but the film indifferently throws this away by making her brother turn out to have committed the deed) & Harry Dean Stanton (Brain from John Carpenter's ultra cool sci-fi classic ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), who gives a good impression as the hick local who proves to be Seagal's greatest asset.

    This is a marvelous film. The juxtaposition of a petite beekeeping blonde with a large muscular dark haired Federal good all round chap has not often been done better. Nuclear cyanide, a wimpy son and heir to a poisoning conglomerate added to the eclectic mix. Fast staging of semi-martial arts fights with quick quips about damaged wood sticks just about sealed it for me. Sadly I watched this film for the first time on the day that Levon Helm died. He died in the film, as the preacher. I could write some great stuff about Seven Seagulls as an actor and mock the film, but won't, out of respect for Mr. Helm.

    This film is different compared to Segals other films,it hardly has any action and they seem to be focused on the plot more, rather than the action.The plot of the movie is Steven segal plays a E.P.A. agent undercover as a maintenance man to investigate a corrupt company that has been dumping toxic waste in Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky. Most of the villains in this movie are country singers,Randy Travis has a cameo appearance.Segal falls in love with a woman everyone in the town dislikes named Sarah Kellog (Marge Hellenberger)because she was falsely accused of murdering her father when she was a child, it was actually her creepy brother Earl(Stephen Lang). This movie has a lot of humor and nice scenery of Kentucky.I would love to live in the south.

    Bad-Ass Steven Seagal Scores, Yet Again, in 'Fire Down Below'. An Ordinary Fare, that works mostly because of Seagal's charisma & honesty. 'Fire Down Below' Synopsis: An EPA agent investigates a Kentucky mine and helps locals stand up for their rights. 'Fire Down Below' is an ordinary fare. It barely offers anything new! Its a been-there-seen-that, done-with-it stuff, that doesn't even intend to leave its view spell-bound. Jeb Stuart & Phillip Morton's Screenplay is fairly engaging. F&eacute;lix Enr&iacute;quez Alcal&aacute;'s Direction is passable. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent. Seagal's an Eternal Bad-Ass & 'Fire Down Below' nods that fact right! His charisma & sheer honesty, is the sole reason to view this film. He's the scene-stealer here! On the whole, 'Fire Down Below' will work for Seagal Fans.

    The usual in Steven Seagal's movies take place in "Fire Down Below" too. He's the good guy again; the hero again; he's never got punched but he kicks and punches lots of guys with the little help of the editor who makes his moves even faster. This movie resembles "On Deadly Ground", so here we have Seagal saving the Earth of the bloody hands of powerful and corrupt business man who are destroying rivers, oceans and trees and all. The major difference between "Fire Down Below" and "On Deadly Ground" is the quality of the movie (for some reason I like "On Deadly...") and the violence/action. While action is dumb and so non breathtaking here, on the previous film was something great, although at times badly used or excessive, especially towards older people, it was literally no country for old men (e.g. the old friend of Seagal tortured and killed in 1994 film). In "Fire Down Below" the same thing happens but it is only implied, nothing is shown on screen and other times it's only a threat. In the story Seagal is a Environmental agent who goes to a little town in Kentucky investigate the murder of his friend who discovered that a powerful company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr. (Kris Kristofferson), is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft. With the assistance of a Reverend (Levon Helm) and a woman (Marg Helgenberger) and some other residents Segal is gonna find the truth and kicks some villains. The lack of action ruined this movie. The lack of violence ruined this movie. The lack of someone able to kick Seagal on the face ruined this and almost all Seagal's movies. The great vantage of this against "On Deadly Ground" is the quotes delivered by Seagal, funny things and for incredible as it might sound these quotes are not unintentionally laughable, they're there for the purpose of being funny. The scene in the casino when Seagal takes down 4 security guys trying to arrest Kristofferson is amazingly funny. I'll not say this was Seagal's worst film, but perhaps his performance was not good enough and the whole supporting cast was very effective and good compared to him. Marg Helgenberger was great, her part was very interesting as the forsaken woman of the town; Stephen Lang plays his usual sinister figure in a twisted character; Kristofferson was quite good and funny; and Levon Helm was the best on scene. The movie includes some bad acting from Brad Hunt (he plays the son of Kristofferson) whose presence is annoying, and some wasted acting by Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Masur (who appears in the beginning in some flashbacks), seriously they deserved a better flick to appear. Again, it is a movie to wait and wait again for action and it will be a few good things in it. Director Felix Enriquez Alcal&aacute; made better with the TV film remake of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three". 4/10

    I watched "Fire Down Below" on a twelve-hours coach trip to Paris, in double bill with "The Sixth Sense" (go figure). Despite Steven Seagal's colourful jackets, this is actually a very entertaining action film. In my humble opinion, two things make it recommendable. The first is the heroine, excellently played by Marg Helbenberg, who brings lots of humanity to her character. It is a pity she did not have a more expressive actor to react to her (although Seagal is good in the action bits which, after all, are his thing). The second (and foremost) is the last scene, the one with Harry Dean Stanton singing and dancing in his newly built porch. Stanton (especially remembered for "Paris, Texas")is one of those actors who have been there for ages but never became a star, whose face is familiar but whose name escapes us. The scene reminds me of that character in "The Searchers", who only wanted "a rocking chair in a porch" in his old age. It is an homage to a veteran actor, a secondary in hundreds of classic westerns and also an accomplished musician. Watching him play "Kentucky Waltz" made me wish the credits rolled forever. A 6 for the film and a 10 for this scene.

    Plot Synopsis: Jack Taggart, an agent working for the EPA, is shocked to discover that his best friend & fellow agent has been killed while investigating reports of people in a rural town in Kentucky getting sick. Posing as a church mission carpenter, he visits the town, uncovering a conspiracy to dump toxic waste in the abandoned coal mines in the nearby mountains by Orin Hanner, a shady businessman whose son runs the town. Faced with a wall of silence in the town & the presence of the dumpers, Jack attempts to expose the dumping & prosecute the people responsible. Film Review: Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers  Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death. As for Steven Seagal, the real-life aikido master, police officer (I'm serious), blues musician & actor (I was going to include CIA agent in that list of achievements but I'm not exactly sure if Seagal ever worked for the agency for real), he tried to reinvent himself as an environmental activist, making a trilogy of films in the mid-to-late 1990s that were eco-thrillers (ON DEADLY GROUND, Fire Down Below & The Patriot) at least in basic plot thematics, that is. Excepting On Deadly Ground, these pro-environment films almost killed Seagal's career stone dead, mainly due to being ridiculously heavy-handed  the villains are all very shrill one-dimensional cardboard cutouts & clich&eacute;s; the scripts are poorly written; & the most serious flaw of all  the action scenes are poorly staged. Fire Down Below starts out in a way that seems to indicate that Seagal is planning to forsake his customary martial arts sequences for some good old fashioned investigative skills. Not counting the short scene where Seagal stumbles onto a cannabis hydroponics farm, there seems to be a lack of anything that even remotely resembles the sort of brutal martial arts fights that Seagal's early films had showcased. But shortly after it starts, the film degenerates into a muddled blend of one-dimensional stereotypes, tepid car chases & poorly-choreographed fight scenes. There are two things I hate while watching films  having my intelligence insulted & being preached to (by that I don't mean social commentaries or satire  I mean films that beat you over the head with messages). Sure enough, Fire Down Below does both. I find it hard to believe that there could be a person (Kris Kristofferson's villain) so cowardly & stupid that he dumps toxic waste in his home town's mountain range. As for the acting, Kristofferson is actually a good actor, but here he has no motivation for his actions. As for the preaching part, the film lays on the let's-look-after-the-environment message with all the subtlety of a kick to the groin. All of Seagal's films (including the dreck that Seagal made during the 2000s) have this concept of White Hat / Black Hat characters (the White Hat is Seagal, while the Black Hat is a really despicable villain). Of course this scripting idea first manifested itself during Seagal's debut film ABOVE THE LAW & continues in this one, with Kris Kristofferson's businessman being an evil coward who spends his working hours in the company of female escorts. The other actors are quite competent in their performances, especially Marg Helgenberger as the love interest (I kind of liked the idea to give her a shady past, but the film indifferently throws this away by making her brother turn out to have committed the deed) & Harry Dean Stanton (Brain from John Carpenter's ultra cool sci-fi classic ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), who gives a good impression as the hick local who proves to be Seagal's greatest asset.

    This is a marvelous film. The juxtaposition of a petite beekeeping blonde with a large muscular dark haired Federal good all round chap has not often been done better. Nuclear cyanide, a wimpy son and heir to a poisoning conglomerate added to the eclectic mix. Fast staging of semi-martial arts fights with quick quips about damaged wood sticks just about sealed it for me. Sadly I watched this film for the first time on the day that Levon Helm died. He died in the film, as the preacher. I could write some great stuff about Seven Seagulls as an actor and mock the film, but won't, out of respect for Mr. Helm.

    This film is different compared to Segals other films,it hardly has any action and they seem to be focused on the plot more, rather than the action.The plot of the movie is Steven segal plays a E.P.A. agent undercover as a maintenance man to investigate a corrupt company that has been dumping toxic waste in Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky. Most of the villains in this movie are country singers,Randy Travis has a cameo appearance.Segal falls in love with a woman everyone in the town dislikes named Sarah Kellog (Marge Hellenberger)because she was falsely accused of murdering her father when she was a child, it was actually her creepy brother Earl(Stephen Lang). This movie has a lot of humor and nice scenery of Kentucky.I would love to live in the south.

    Bad-Ass Steven Seagal Scores, Yet Again, in 'Fire Down Below'. An Ordinary Fare, that works mostly because of Seagal's charisma & honesty. 'Fire Down Below' Synopsis: An EPA agent investigates a Kentucky mine and helps locals stand up for their rights. 'Fire Down Below' is an ordinary fare. It barely offers anything new! Its a been-there-seen-that, done-with-it stuff, that doesn't even intend to leave its view spell-bound. Jeb Stuart & Phillip Morton's Screenplay is fairly engaging. F&eacute;lix Enr&iacute;quez Alcal&aacute;'s Direction is passable. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent. Seagal's an Eternal Bad-Ass & 'Fire Down Below' nods that fact right! His charisma & sheer honesty, is the sole reason to view this film. He's the scene-stealer here! On the whole, 'Fire Down Below' will work for Seagal Fans.

    The usual in Steven Seagal's movies take place in "Fire Down Below" too. He's the good guy again; the hero again; he's never got punched but he kicks and punches lots of guys with the little help of the editor who makes his moves even faster. This movie resembles "On Deadly Ground", so here we have Seagal saving the Earth of the bloody hands of powerful and corrupt business man who are destroying rivers, oceans and trees and all. The major difference between "Fire Down Below" and "On Deadly Ground" is the quality of the movie (for some reason I like "On Deadly...") and the violence/action. While action is dumb and so non breathtaking here, on the previous film was something great, although at times badly used or excessive, especially towards older people, it was literally no country for old men (e.g. the old friend of Seagal tortured and killed in 1994 film). In "Fire Down Below" the same thing happens but it is only implied, nothing is shown on screen and other times it's only a threat. In the story Seagal is a Environmental agent who goes to a little town in Kentucky investigate the murder of his friend who discovered that a powerful company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr. (Kris Kristofferson), is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft. With the assistance of a Reverend (Levon Helm) and a woman (Marg Helgenberger) and some other residents Segal is gonna find the truth and kicks some villains. The lack of action ruined this movie. The lack of violence ruined this movie. The lack of someone able to kick Seagal on the face ruined this and almost all Seagal's movies. The great vantage of this against "On Deadly Ground" is the quotes delivered by Seagal, funny things and for incredible as it might sound these quotes are not unintentionally laughable, they're there for the purpose of being funny. The scene in the casino when Seagal takes down 4 security guys trying to arrest Kristofferson is amazingly funny. I'll not say this was Seagal's worst film, but perhaps his performance was not good enough and the whole supporting cast was very effective and good compared to him. Marg Helgenberger was great, her part was very interesting as the forsaken woman of the town; Stephen Lang plays his usual sinister figure in a twisted character; Kristofferson was quite good and funny; and Levon Helm was the best on scene. The movie includes some bad acting from Brad Hunt (he plays the son of Kristofferson) whose presence is annoying, and some wasted acting by Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Masur (who appears in the beginning in some flashbacks), seriously they deserved a better flick to appear. Again, it is a movie to wait and wait again for action and it will be a few good things in it. Director Felix Enriquez Alcal&aacute; made better with the TV film remake of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three". 4/10

    love him or hate him,you have to admit,Steven Seagal's movies pretty much follow the same tried and true formula,which basically involves Seagal ending up on someone's bad side,and then proceeding to show off his martial arts prowess by beating up everybody in sight.well not everybody.just the bad people.this movie is no different.but hey,it works.it's nothing new or original.but if you're a Seagal fan,this should quench your thirst.like his previous movie,On Deadly Ground there's an environmental theme here too.Marg Helgenbberger(CSI Las Vegas)plays the love interest and does a good job with her character.Harry dean Stanton is also very good.There are also a lot of country stars in the movie,including Kris Kristofferson,who is very impressive.there are nice fight sequences in this one.for me,Fire Down Below is a 7/10

    An EPA agent Jack Taggart (Seagal) is sent to go "undercover" in eastern Kentucky to find out who's responsible for dumping toxins in the ground. Of course in a film like this, there's a friend of Taggart's who's dead, so he has to avenge him. The locals, mostly poor are too afraid to make much noise about who's doing it for fear of reprisals. So Taggart strolls into town and starts doing odd jobs for a church fixing up some local's porches, playing the fiddle and then meets the female lead Sarah Kellogg (Helgenberger). It's just as bad as it sounds. I like to the scene where he grabs the rattle snake lighting quick, I guess I'm not the only one who saw "Hard Target". Pretty soon he gets into fights with the local trash and as always dominates and finds out that Orin Hanner Sr. (Kristofferson) is the guy behind the whole operation. Taggart goes after his spineless son Orin Jr. (Hunt) who runs the business locally and eventually takes it to the top and sends Sr. to the big house in an anti climatic ending. This is one of Seagal's worst movies in my opinion. Even in films where the script was bad, Seagal usually would come through with some good fight sequences but even these are fairly lame in this. More often you are waiting for some action to actually happen, but rather you get to see Seagal glad hand the locals, sing, play guitars, square dance, give an environmental speech and do routine maintenance for the poor. Can you say stupid? The movie is boring and Seagal supposedly undercover stands out like sore thumb with those silly jackets. With the few action scenes you get, all are vastly inferior to those of his past greats and what kicks he had are very poor indeed. By this time in his career he was not in great shape and this may have affected the scenes in general. The best action scene in the film actually involves a big rig chasing him in truck like Red Fox's. To add to this, there is very little killing in this, not only does he push the environmental message, but he kills very few people. I mean come on, the staple of a film like this is the showdown at the end and the bad guy bites it. But no Seagal wounds the guy and arrests him. And don't even get me started with the gas station and the flare, didn't want to hurt any bystanders I suppose. WEAK! There are plenty of fine actors in this film, not really sure why, who also come out looking thoroughly awful. Nobody usually expects fine acting from a film like this, but good actors can only do so much with a terrible script and this proves good actors can be totally wasted on poor writing. Harry Dean Stanton is great and he has such a weak hillbilly role in this, along with Helgenberger. And of course Seagal speaks as always painfully low toned and silly, like he's on depressants. If your fan of The Punisher look for Mark Collie playing a hick who can't fight. Also once Seagal started putting into his films too much of an environmental message the movies began to go down hill. Believe me, I'm for the environment, but it has very little place in these films and Seagal looks like a fool doing speeches on the subject, remember On Deadly Ground? This is worse. There very few bright spots, one being the location shots. OK nice, but I came to see action not Kentucky. For country music fans I would imagine this is a gold mine, with lots of music and stars making appearances in the films. Again, didn't come to see that. With a few one liners that are OK, there is nothing much more to say that is good. Surprisingly this was released in theaters and I can see why it was one of his last. Overall a very poor action film, with no nudity to speak of equals 1 out of 10 stars.

    Here's another attempt from Seagal to send a important message to the world  be careful with the environment . And it's just as wonderful as "On deadly ground" . It's not a bad thing when you're trying to say something important. It's bad when you fail to both entertain and send a message. The message here seems sincere , but it's too preachy just like in "ODG" . What is more important is for an action movie "FDB" sucks . The shootouts and car chases are badly edited. You can't see a thing ! Same goes for fight scenes . There is one fight scene at the beginning of the movie  Seagal fights with few opponents . He beats down one of them , then he defeats second one , then he punches the guy THAT WAS DEFEATED AS FIRST AND LYING UNCONSCIOUS ON GROUND , then he defeats the third one . Talk about bad montage The movie also tries to put Seagal in believable romantic story , but it fails just as always. The only thing good here is the guitar music . Anyway , this is a really bad movie . Second in Seagal's "save the environment trilogy " ( The trilogy includes "On deadly ground" , "Fire down below" and "The Patriot" ). I give it 1/10.

    A bland eco-muddle that fails to settle on a genre. The gear-shifting mixture of romance, action, drama and environmental preaching just doesn't work, and it's not made any more successful by Steven Seagal's rubbish performance, which consists of his usual frowning routine with a hint of constipation and a touch of whispery woodenness. He seems to be acting in a completely different film to the rest of the cast and constantly undermines the sparks of interest that pop up from time to time. This well-intentioned but flat movie trundles along painlessly for 100 minutes or so while the small-town-versus-rich-boss clich&eacute;s pile up around everyone's feet, then Harry Dean Stanton sings a song, and that's that.

    I watched "Fire Down Below" on a twelve-hours coach trip to Paris, in double bill with "The Sixth Sense" (go figure). Despite Steven Seagal's colourful jackets, this is actually a very entertaining action film. In my humble opinion, two things make it recommendable. The first is the heroine, excellently played by Marg Helbenberg, who brings lots of humanity to her character. It is a pity she did not have a more expressive actor to react to her (although Seagal is good in the action bits which, after all, are his thing). The second (and foremost) is the last scene, the one with Harry Dean Stanton singing and dancing in his newly built porch. Stanton (especially remembered for "Paris, Texas")is one of those actors who have been there for ages but never became a star, whose face is familiar but whose name escapes us. The scene reminds me of that character in "The Searchers", who only wanted "a rocking chair in a porch" in his old age. It is an homage to a veteran actor, a secondary in hundreds of classic westerns and also an accomplished musician. Watching him play "Kentucky Waltz" made me wish the credits rolled forever. A 6 for the film and a 10 for this scene.

    Plot Synopsis: Jack Taggart, an agent working for the EPA, is shocked to discover that his best friend & fellow agent has been killed while investigating reports of people in a rural town in Kentucky getting sick. Posing as a church mission carpenter, he visits the town, uncovering a conspiracy to dump toxic waste in the abandoned coal mines in the nearby mountains by Orin Hanner, a shady businessman whose son runs the town. Faced with a wall of silence in the town & the presence of the dumpers, Jack attempts to expose the dumping & prosecute the people responsible. Film Review: Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers  Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death. As for Steven Seagal, the real-life aikido master, police officer (I'm serious), blues musician & actor (I was going to include CIA agent in that list of achievements but I'm not exactly sure if Seagal ever worked for the agency for real), he tried to reinvent himself as an environmental activist, making a trilogy of films in the mid-to-late 1990s that were eco-thrillers (ON DEADLY GROUND, Fire Down Below & The Patriot) at least in basic plot thematics, that is. Excepting On Deadly Ground, these pro-environment films almost killed Seagal's career stone dead, mainly due to being ridiculously heavy-handed  the villains are all very shrill one-dimensional cardboard cutouts & clich&eacute;s; the scripts are poorly written; & the most serious flaw of all  the action scenes are poorly staged. Fire Down Below starts out in a way that seems to indicate that Seagal is planning to forsake his customary martial arts sequences for some good old fashioned investigative skills. Not counting the short scene where Seagal stumbles onto a cannabis hydroponics farm, there seems to be a lack of anything that even remotely resembles the sort of brutal martial arts fights that Seagal's early films had showcased. But shortly after it starts, the film degenerates into a muddled blend of one-dimensional stereotypes, tepid car chases & poorly-choreographed fight scenes. There are two things I hate while watching films  having my intelligence insulted & being preached to (by that I don't mean social commentaries or satire  I mean films that beat you over the head with messages). Sure enough, Fire Down Below does both. I find it hard to believe that there could be a person (Kris Kristofferson's villain) so cowardly & stupid that he dumps toxic waste in his home town's mountain range. As for the acting, Kristofferson is actually a good actor, but here he has no motivation for his actions. As for the preaching part, the film lays on the let's-look-after-the-environment message with all the subtlety of a kick to the groin. All of Seagal's films (including the dreck that Seagal made during the 2000s) have this concept of White Hat / Black Hat characters (the White Hat is Seagal, while the Black Hat is a really despicable villain). Of course this scripting idea first manifested itself during Seagal's debut film ABOVE THE LAW & continues in this one, with Kris Kristofferson's businessman being an evil coward who spends his working hours in the company of female escorts. The other actors are quite competent in their performances, especially Marg Helgenberger as the love interest (I kind of liked the idea to give her a shady past, but the film indifferently throws this away by making her brother turn out to have committed the deed) & Harry Dean Stanton (Brain from John Carpenter's ultra cool sci-fi classic ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), who gives a good impression as the hick local who proves to be Seagal's greatest asset.

    Here's another attempt from Seagal to send a important message to the world  be careful with the environment . And it's just as wonderful as "On deadly ground" . It's not a bad thing when you're trying to say something important. It's bad when you fail to both entertain and send a message. The message here seems sincere , but it's too preachy just like in "ODG" . What is more important is for an action movie "FDB" sucks . The shootouts and car chases are badly edited. You can't see a thing ! Same goes for fight scenes . There is one fight scene at the beginning of the movie  Seagal fights with few opponents . He beats down one of them , then he defeats second one , then he punches the guy THAT WAS DEFEATED AS FIRST AND LYING UNCONSCIOUS ON GROUND , then he defeats the third one . Talk about bad montage The movie also tries to put Seagal in believable romantic story , but it fails just as always. The only thing good here is the guitar music . Anyway , this is a really bad movie . Second in Seagal's "save the environment trilogy " ( The trilogy includes "On deadly ground" , "Fire down below" and "The Patriot" ). I give it 1/10.

    A bland eco-muddle that fails to settle on a genre. The gear-shifting mixture of romance, action, drama and environmental preaching just doesn't work, and it's not made any more successful by Steven Seagal's rubbish performance, which consists of his usual frowning routine with a hint of constipation and a touch of whispery woodenness. He seems to be acting in a completely different film to the rest of the cast and constantly undermines the sparks of interest that pop up from time to time. This well-intentioned but flat movie trundles along painlessly for 100 minutes or so while the small-town-versus-rich-boss clich&eacute;s pile up around everyone's feet, then Harry Dean Stanton sings a song, and that's that.

    I watched "Fire Down Below" on a twelve-hours coach trip to Paris, in double bill with "The Sixth Sense" (go figure). Despite Steven Seagal's colourful jackets, this is actually a very entertaining action film. In my humble opinion, two things make it recommendable. The first is the heroine, excellently played by Marg Helbenberg, who brings lots of humanity to her character. It is a pity she did not have a more expressive actor to react to her (although Seagal is good in the action bits which, after all, are his thing). The second (and foremost) is the last scene, the one with Harry Dean Stanton singing and dancing in his newly built porch. Stanton (especially remembered for "Paris, Texas")is one of those actors who have been there for ages but never became a star, whose face is familiar but whose name escapes us. The scene reminds me of that character in "The Searchers", who only wanted "a rocking chair in a porch" in his old age. It is an homage to a veteran actor, a secondary in hundreds of classic westerns and also an accomplished musician. Watching him play "Kentucky Waltz" made me wish the credits rolled forever. A 6 for the film and a 10 for this scene.

    Plot Synopsis: Jack Taggart, an agent working for the EPA, is shocked to discover that his best friend & fellow agent has been killed while investigating reports of people in a rural town in Kentucky getting sick. Posing as a church mission carpenter, he visits the town, uncovering a conspiracy to dump toxic waste in the abandoned coal mines in the nearby mountains by Orin Hanner, a shady businessman whose son runs the town. Faced with a wall of silence in the town & the presence of the dumpers, Jack attempts to expose the dumping & prosecute the people responsible. Film Review: Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers  Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death. As for Steven Seagal, the real-life aikido master, police officer (I'm serious), blues musician & actor (I was going to include CIA agent in that list of achievements but I'm not exactly sure if Seagal ever worked for the agency for real), he tried to reinvent himself as an environmental activist, making a trilogy of films in the mid-to-late 1990s that were eco-thrillers (ON DEADLY GROUND, Fire Down Below & The Patriot) at least in basic plot thematics, that is. Excepting On Deadly Ground, these pro-environment films almost killed Seagal's career stone dead, mainly due to being ridiculously heavy-handed  the villains are all very shrill one-dimensional cardboard cutouts & clich&eacute;s; the scripts are poorly written; & the most serious flaw of all  the action scenes are poorly staged. Fire Down Below starts out in a way that seems to indicate that Seagal is planning to forsake his customary martial arts sequences for some good old fashioned investigative skills. Not counting the short scene where Seagal stumbles onto a cannabis hydroponics farm, there seems to be a lack of anything that even remotely resembles the sort of brutal martial arts fights that Seagal's early films had showcased. But shortly after it starts, the film degenerates into a muddled blend of one-dimensional stereotypes, tepid car chases & poorly-choreographed fight scenes. There are two things I hate while watching films  having my intelligence insulted & being preached to (by that I don't mean social commentaries or satire  I mean films that beat you over the head with messages). Sure enough, Fire Down Below does both. I find it hard to believe that there could be a person (Kris Kristofferson's villain) so cowardly & stupid that he dumps toxic waste in his home town's mountain range. As for the acting, Kristofferson is actually a good actor, but here he has no motivation for his actions. As for the preaching part, the film lays on the let's-look-after-the-environment message with all the subtlety of a kick to the groin. All of Seagal's films (including the dreck that Seagal made during the 2000s) have this concept of White Hat / Black Hat characters (the White Hat is Seagal, while the Black Hat is a really despicable villain). Of course this scripting idea first manifested itself during Seagal's debut film ABOVE THE LAW & continues in this one, with Kris Kristofferson's businessman being an evil coward who spends his working hours in the company of female escorts. The other actors are quite competent in their performances, especially Marg Helgenberger as the love interest (I kind of liked the idea to give her a shady past, but the film indifferently throws this away by making her brother turn out to have committed the deed) & Harry Dean Stanton (Brain from John Carpenter's ultra cool sci-fi classic ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), who gives a good impression as the hick local who proves to be Seagal's greatest asset.

    This is a marvelous film. The juxtaposition of a petite beekeeping blonde with a large muscular dark haired Federal good all round chap has not often been done better. Nuclear cyanide, a wimpy son and heir to a poisoning conglomerate added to the eclectic mix. Fast staging of semi-martial arts fights with quick quips about damaged wood sticks just about sealed it for me. Sadly I watched this film for the first time on the day that Levon Helm died. He died in the film, as the preacher. I could write some great stuff about Seven Seagulls as an actor and mock the film, but won't, out of respect for Mr. Helm.

    This film is different compared to Segals other films,it hardly has any action and they seem to be focused on the plot more, rather than the action.The plot of the movie is Steven segal plays a E.P.A. agent undercover as a maintenance man to investigate a corrupt company that has been dumping toxic waste in Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky. Most of the villains in this movie are country singers,Randy Travis has a cameo appearance.Segal falls in love with a woman everyone in the town dislikes named Sarah Kellog (Marge Hellenberger)because she was falsely accused of murdering her father when she was a child, it was actually her creepy brother Earl(Stephen Lang). This movie has a lot of humor and nice scenery of Kentucky.I would love to live in the south.

    Bad-Ass Steven Seagal Scores, Yet Again, in 'Fire Down Below'. An Ordinary Fare, that works mostly because of Seagal's charisma & honesty. 'Fire Down Below' Synopsis: An EPA agent investigates a Kentucky mine and helps locals stand up for their rights. 'Fire Down Below' is an ordinary fare. It barely offers anything new! Its a been-there-seen-that, done-with-it stuff, that doesn't even intend to leave its view spell-bound. Jeb Stuart & Phillip Morton's Screenplay is fairly engaging. F&eacute;lix Enr&iacute;quez Alcal&aacute;'s Direction is passable. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent. Seagal's an Eternal Bad-Ass & 'Fire Down Below' nods that fact right! His charisma & sheer honesty, is the sole reason to view this film. He's the scene-stealer here! On the whole, 'Fire Down Below' will work for Seagal Fans.

    The usual in Steven Seagal's movies take place in "Fire Down Below" too. He's the good guy again; the hero again; he's never got punched but he kicks and punches lots of guys with the little help of the editor who makes his moves even faster. This movie resembles "On Deadly Ground", so here we have Seagal saving the Earth of the bloody hands of powerful and corrupt business man who are destroying rivers, oceans and trees and all. The major difference between "Fire Down Below" and "On Deadly Ground" is the quality of the movie (for some reason I like "On Deadly...") and the violence/action. While action is dumb and so non breathtaking here, on the previous film was something great, although at times badly used or excessive, especially towards older people, it was literally no country for old men (e.g. the old friend of Seagal tortured and killed in 1994 film). In "Fire Down Below" the same thing happens but it is only implied, nothing is shown on screen and other times it's only a threat. In the story Seagal is a Environmental agent who goes to a little town in Kentucky investigate the murder of his friend who discovered that a powerful company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr. (Kris Kristofferson), is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft. With the assistance of a Reverend (Levon Helm) and a woman (Marg Helgenberger) and some other residents Segal is gonna find the truth and kicks some villains. The lack of action ruined this movie. The lack of violence ruined this movie. The lack of someone able to kick Seagal on the face ruined this and almost all Seagal's movies. The great vantage of this against "On Deadly Ground" is the quotes delivered by Seagal, funny things and for incredible as it might sound these quotes are not unintentionally laughable, they're there for the purpose of being funny. The scene in the casino when Seagal takes down 4 security guys trying to arrest Kristofferson is amazingly funny. I'll not say this was Seagal's worst film, but perhaps his performance was not good enough and the whole supporting cast was very effective and good compared to him. Marg Helgenberger was great, her part was very interesting as the forsaken woman of the town; Stephen Lang plays his usual sinister figure in a twisted character; Kristofferson was quite good and funny; and Levon Helm was the best on scene. The movie includes some bad acting from Brad Hunt (he plays the son of Kristofferson) whose presence is annoying, and some wasted acting by Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Masur (who appears in the beginning in some flashbacks), seriously they deserved a better flick to appear. Again, it is a movie to wait and wait again for action and it will be a few good things in it. Director Felix Enriquez Alcal&aacute; made better with the TV film remake of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three". 4/10

    love him or hate him,you have to admit,Steven Seagal's movies pretty much follow the same tried and true formula,which basically involves Seagal ending up on someone's bad side,and then proceeding to show off his martial arts prowess by beating up everybody in sight.well not everybody.just the bad people.this movie is no different.but hey,it works.it's nothing new or original.but if you're a Seagal fan,this should quench your thirst.like his previous movie,On Deadly Ground there's an environmental theme here too.Marg Helgenbberger(CSI Las Vegas)plays the love interest and does a good job with her character.Harry dean Stanton is also very good.There are also a lot of country stars in the movie,including Kris Kristofferson,who is very impressive.there are nice fight sequences in this one.for me,Fire Down Below is a 7/10

    An EPA agent Jack Taggart (Seagal) is sent to go "undercover" in eastern Kentucky to find out who's responsible for dumping toxins in the ground. Of course in a film like this, there's a friend of Taggart's who's dead, so he has to avenge him. The locals, mostly poor are too afraid to make much noise about who's doing it for fear of reprisals. So Taggart strolls into town and starts doing odd jobs for a church fixing up some local's porches, playing the fiddle and then meets the female lead Sarah Kellogg (Helgenberger). It's just as bad as it sounds. I like to the scene where he grabs the rattle snake lighting quick, I guess I'm not the only one who saw "Hard Target". Pretty soon he gets into fights with the local trash and as always dominates and finds out that Orin Hanner Sr. (Kristofferson) is the guy behind the whole operation. Taggart goes after his spineless son Orin Jr. (Hunt) who runs the business locally and eventually takes it to the top and sends Sr. to the big house in an anti climatic ending. This is one of Seagal's worst movies in my opinion. Even in films where the script was bad, Seagal usually would come through with some good fight sequences but even these are fairly lame in this. More often you are waiting for some action to actually happen, but rather you get to see Seagal glad hand the locals, sing, play guitars, square dance, give an environmental speech and do routine maintenance for the poor. Can you say stupid? The movie is boring and Seagal supposedly undercover stands out like sore thumb with those silly jackets. With the few action scenes you get, all are vastly inferior to those of his past greats and what kicks he had are very poor indeed. By this time in his career he was not in great shape and this may have affected the scenes in general. The best action scene in the film actually involves a big rig chasing him in truck like Red Fox's. To add to this, there is very little killing in this, not only does he push the environmental message, but he kills very few people. I mean come on, the staple of a film like this is the showdown at the end and the bad guy bites it. But no Seagal wounds the guy and arrests him. And don't even get me started with the gas station and the flare, didn't want to hurt any bystanders I suppose. WEAK! There are plenty of fine actors in this film, not really sure why, who also come out looking thoroughly awful. Nobody usually expects fine acting from a film like this, but good actors can only do so much with a terrible script and this proves good actors can be totally wasted on poor writing. Harry Dean Stanton is great and he has such a weak hillbilly role in this, along with Helgenberger. And of course Seagal speaks as always painfully low toned and silly, like he's on depressants. If your fan of The Punisher look for Mark Collie playing a hick who can't fight. Also once Seagal started putting into his films too much of an environmental message the movies began to go down hill. Believe me, I'm for the environment, but it has very little place in these films and Seagal looks like a fool doing speeches on the subject, remember On Deadly Ground? This is worse. There very few bright spots, one being the location shots. OK nice, but I came to see action not Kentucky. For country music fans I would imagine this is a gold mine, with lots of music and stars making appearances in the films. Again, didn't come to see that. With a few one liners that are OK, there is nothing much more to say that is good. Surprisingly this was released in theaters and I can see why it was one of his last. Overall a very poor action film, with no nudity to speak of equals 1 out of 10 stars.

Film Review: Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers  Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death.

The major difference between "Fire Down Below" and "On Deadly Ground" is the quality of the movie (for some reason I like "On Deadly...") and the violence/action. While action is dumb and so non breathtaking here, on the previous film was something great, although at times badly used or excessive, especially towards older people, it was literally no country for old men (e.g. the old friend of Seagal tortured and killed in 1994 film). In "Fire Down Below" the same thing happens but it is only implied, nothing is shown on screen and other times it's only a threat. In the story Seagal is a Environmental agent who goes to a little town in Kentucky investigate the murder of his friend who discovered that a powerful company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr. (Kris Kristofferson), is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft. With the assistance of a Reverend (Levon Helm) and a woman (Marg Helgenberger) and some other residents Segal is gonna find the truth and kicks some villains. The lack of action ruined this movie. The lack of violence ruined this movie. The lack of someone able to kick Seagal on the face ruined this and almost all Seagal's movies. The great vantage of this against "On Deadly Ground" is the quotes delivered by Seagal, funny things and for incredible as it might sound these quotes are not unintentionally laughable, they're there for the purpose of being funny. The scene in the casino when Seagal takes down 4 security guys trying to arrest Kristofferson is amazingly funny. I'll not say this was Seagal's worst film, but perhaps his performance was not good enough and the whole supporting cast was very effective and good compared to him. Marg Helgenberger was great, her part was very interesting as the forsaken woman of the town; Stephen Lang plays his usual sinister figure in a twisted character; Kristofferson was quite good and funny; and Levon Helm was the best on scene. The movie includes some bad acting from Brad Hunt (he plays the son of Kristofferson) whose presence is annoying, and some wasted acting by Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Masur (who appears in the beginning in some flashbacks), seriously they deserved a better flick to appear. Again, it is a movie to wait and wait again for action and it will be a few good things in it. Director Felix Enriquez Alcal&aacute; made better with the TV film remake of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three". 4/10

    love him or hate him,you have to admit,Steven Seagal's movies pretty much follow the same tried and true formula,which basically involves Seagal ending up on someone's bad side,and then proceeding to show off his martial arts prowess by beating up everybody in sight.well not everybody.just the bad people.this movie is no different.but hey,it works.it's nothing new or original.but if you're a Seagal fan,this should quench your thirst.like his previous movie,On Deadly Ground there's an environmental theme here too.Marg Helgenbberger(CSI Las Vegas)plays the love interest and does a good job with her character.Harry dean Stanton is also very good.There are also a lot of country stars in the movie,including Kris Kristofferson,who is very impressive.there are nice fight sequences in this one.for me,Fire Down Below is a 7/10

    An EPA agent Jack Taggart (Seagal) is sent to go "undercover" in eastern Kentucky to find out who's responsible for dumping toxins in the ground. Of course in a film like this, there's a friend of Taggart's who's dead, so he has to avenge him. The locals, mostly poor are too afraid to make much noise about who's doing it for fear of reprisals. So Taggart strolls into town and starts doing odd jobs for a church fixing up some local's porches, playing the fiddle and then meets the female lead Sarah Kellogg (Helgenberger). It's just as bad as it sounds. I like to the scene where he grabs the rattle snake lighting quick, I guess I'm not the only one who saw "Hard Target". Pretty soon he gets into fights with the local trash and as always dominates and finds out that Orin Hanner Sr. (Kristofferson) is the guy behind the whole operation. Taggart goes after his spineless son Orin Jr. (Hunt) who runs the business locally and eventually takes it to the top and sends Sr. to the big house in an anti climatic ending. This is one of Seagal's worst movies in my opinion. Even in films where the script was bad, Seagal usually would come through with some good fight sequences but even these are fairly lame in this. More often you are waiting for some action to actually happen, but rather you get to see Seagal glad hand the locals, sing, play guitars, square dance, give an environmental speech and do routine maintenance for the poor. Can you say stupid? The movie is boring and Seagal supposedly undercover stands out like sore thumb with those silly jackets. With the few action scenes you get, all are vastly inferior to those of his past greats and what kicks he had are very poor indeed. By this time in his career he was not in great shape and this may have affected the scenes in general. The best action scene in the film actually involves a big rig chasing him in truck like Red Fox's. To add to this, there is very little killing in this, not only does he push the environmental message, but he kills very few people. I mean come on, the staple of a film like this is the showdown at the end and the bad guy bites it. But no Seagal wounds the guy and arrests him. And don't even get me started with the gas station and the flare, didn't want to hurt any bystanders I suppose. WEAK! There are plenty of fine actors in this film, not really sure why, who also come out looking thoroughly awful. Nobody usually expects fine acting from a film like this, but good actors can only do so much with a terrible script and this proves good actors can be totally wasted on poor writing. Harry Dean Stanton is great and he has such a weak hillbilly role in this, along with Helgenberger. And of course Seagal speaks as always painfully low toned and silly, like he's on depressants. If your fan of The Punisher look for Mark Collie playing a hick who can't fight. Also once Seagal started putting into his films too much of an environmental message the movies began to go down hill. Believe me, I'm for the environment, but it has very little place in these films and Seagal looks like a fool doing speeches on the subject, remember On Deadly Ground? This is worse. There very few bright spots, one being the location shots. OK nice, but I came to see action not Kentucky. For country music fans I would imagine this is a gold mine, with lots of music and stars making appearances in the films. Again, didn't come to see that. With a few one liners that are OK, there is nothing much more to say that is good. Surprisingly this was released in theaters and I can see why it was one of his last. Overall a very poor action film, with no nudity to speak of equals 1 out of 10 stars.
