  200 years after the conclusion of Alien 3, the company is able to resurrect Ripley through the process of cloning and the scientists successfully take the Queen Alien out of her.

Soon the Xeno-morphs are running amok on the ship, which is on course to earth. The Queen then gives birth to a deadly new breed of alien, which could spell disaster for the entire human race.

    Well, I did not want to watch this title even being an Alien/Predator franchise lover and also Jean-Pierre Jeunet devoted fan since third Alien movie by David Fincher was awful and this one has low ratings. So I pulled myself together, pressed 'Play' button and what do you think happened? It was pretty interesting from its very beginning to the end! I've just been watching it and didn't even go to take one more cup of tea or something.. Great acting made me love these actors more than I did, Ron Perlman did his best, Dominique Pinon was not so good though.. These scary scenery were just like from other Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movies, especially in that lab scene.. But the real question is WHY did they killed that baby?! It was really cute! It was looking at its 'mom' and saying 'please, why are you leaving, don't, why are you trying to kill me, mom?' I almost cried. She could make it not to kill people, the child was supposed to listen to its 'mom'.. And I don't know really why the hell it killed the queen, she was just like a woman and I didn't expect that baby's gonna kill her.. Finally, from now on it's in my favorites. One more great Alien movie. One more great Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie.

    Resurrection is the death of the "Alien" franchise

    While I found "Alien 3" to not be that great and be extremely mediocre, "Alien: Resurrection" proves to be the worst of the "Alien" films in my opinion and does many things that I find infuriating in film. The third film had a great ending to it with the intense game of cat and mouse through the prison and Ripley's sacrifice so that the Weyland Corporation could not get its hands on the alien. Everything is tied up nicely and there are no lose ends. Then, along comes "Alien: Resurrection", which is the true road to ruin for the "Alien" movies. We open up at least a thousand years later after the events of "Alien 3". Ripley has been cloned and the Weyland Corporation is also trying to recreate the alien species, succeeding in making several clones using kidnapped humans collected by mercenaries as hosts. The aliens soon mature and escape, damaging the ship. The first things that really infuriated me with this movie was with Ripley being alive because she was cloned. I do not like characters who die to come back to life in movies unless they are like ghosts or the method for their resurrection is set up ahead of time. So, Ripley is alive because she was the star of the first three films so they need her to be in it or it will not be a true "Alien" film. That is what it felt like to me. My next biggest issue was with the new creature introduced in the movie. The three movies before it had clever ideas, even if they were mild. "Alien" introduced us to the species and the face-huggers, "Aliens" gave us the idea of a queen alien, and the third one had an alien but since it came out of a dog and not a human, it behaved a little like a dog would. What this film did was not even remotely clever. They had a half- human half-alien hybrid. This just screams to me that they wanted something new but could not think of something remotely clever so they did one of the most clich&eacute; things imaginable, mixing a human with the creature. Another problem I had was with the movie all together. It had nothing for the audience besides aliens hunting down and killing the humans. The characters were uninteresting--not that the characters from the first three films were works of art but they at least made you care--so we did not care if they succeeded or not as the only person we might be able to relate to is Ripley, but she's a clone and not the real Ripley so there is nothing from that. The film is played off more as aliens in "Poseidon" as the characters are escaping from a ship, going through different obstacles while aliens instead of rising water are following them. There is little tension as they could easily defeat the aliens. They have firepower and there is less than ten aliens. In "Alien" and "Alien 3", they had little to no weapons and in "Aliens" they had weapons but not enough to fight them all. There was tension with that. In this, the characters are all armed and there are few enough aliens that they could just fight them off, ergo, no tension. To try and compensate for this, they have one mercenary in a wheelchair and a guy with an embryo in him that is about to erupt from his chest, but both of these fail to bring tension to the audience. While I would watch "Alien: Resurrection" over other films I have seen, the film fails on multiple levels and takes the "Alien" franchise from having an ending that was pretty good to a lousy ending where we are left with our surviving characters sitting around with a "what happens now?" thought running through the audience's brains.

    An absolute Gorefest. Probably, an inevitable inclusion in the popular Franchise considering the Creature and where it had yet to go. Over the top and then some. Not a bad idea in the ongoing Saga of the "Thing from Another World". Fans are mixed on this with most leaning to the "forget this one and call it a trilogy" and many stick to that Mantra to this day. But lets take a look. Speaking of look, this is a slick, funk-punk, biker bash of slime and grime with a sheen of Violence that Fangoria types might appreciate. The beyond the pale goings-on that have a certain Pulpy charm is almost ruined by one Scene that is so gut-wrenching and ugly that, after viewing, the pit of your stomach may never be the same. Its the Window Vacuum Scene of course. But that God-Awful display aside, that dare it be said, truly sucks, this mostly can pass as a pretty good, very violent and horrific extension that, let's be honest, was certainly not going to end when there are cash registers to ring, to this day is still trying to expand.

    So what I do is to buy the entire Alien Quadrilogy, and sit down for a marathon. The first two were awesome, the third being alright, and then I look forward to seeing how they could continue after killing off Ripley. And with Alien Resurrection, they proved that the third movie should have been the last one. Not sure if anyone notices, but the crew following Ripley in each movie have a lot to say for the atmosphere. The original movie had a spaceship crew, then come the marines, and after that come a bunch of space convicts. Sorry, but I can't see the people in this movie as anything else than a bunch of retards. Some scenes I loathe: the scientist that uses steam to tame an Alien, scenes with that gun-guy ricocheting bullets via the walls and things (it's just not going to work), the way Ripley shows little fear of the Aliens anymore, and (good grief) the new Alien introduced at the end of the movie: Clone-Ripley's hybrid-humanoid-alien-beast-thing. Let's take a look at the last one. To me, he became an instant Jar Jar Binks of the Alien universe. My first thought was: "NO". When they kill it, it even looks at Ripley with sad eyes and desperately cries "Mommy!" Dear producers, think for a second: this thing had been alive for almost five minutes, and now it has learned English. Just the ending in itself kills everything with the Aliens: the danger, the sinister promise of certain death, and the pure genius characteristic design of HR Giger. Just sad. Please, no more Alien movies after this one. Some things can not be repaired.

    In an interview Ridley Scott cited the old Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant comics as one of many inspirations for Alien. Of all the films, the one that most resembles Heavy Metal is Jean-Pierre Jeunet's demented, over-the-top, but not unentertaining fourth entry. This is another entry that uh...alienated fans, and it certainly doesn't have any of the atmosphere or suspense of even Alien 3. Visually, it's quite uneven. Production design is impressive, effects not always so - even in 1997. Gore is ramped up to 11. Indeed we see far more blood and guts in this one than all the others put together. A number of critics had issues with the humour on display, but I personally found this refreshing. It was interesting to see a more lighthearted display in an Alien segment after the deadly seriousness of the first three. Where it most delivers is in Sigourney, excellent again, this time as a superhuman part-alien clone of Ripley, and in the frantic moments when the characters are facing off against the aliens. The monsters are menacing as always, and this time they're not above sacrificing one of their own for their own benefit. A brand new member to the Alien family, while perhaps not as scary as intended, provides some good moments at the climax. While suffering in comparison to it's predecessors, on it's own terms it makes for good, gruesome, comic-book-style mayhem.

    Alien is rightfully considered possibly the finest horror/sci-fi film of all time (The Thing and The Fly its' only real competitors, interestingly both remakes). Aliens is the best sci-fi/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered. Alien; Resurrection was a valiant attempt to put things right and my boy Joss Whedon does a commendable job. But he had a long way to climb after the debacle of Alien 3. Really Resurrection isn't a great film overall but it has some terrific things about it. Sigourney is great as always, Wionna does OK in her role, the relationship between Cal and Ripley 8 is brilliant and spawned a thousand slash fanfics. You can see the beginnings of Firefly here, even down to a prototype Jane and River. The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens. Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films). She and Cal gaze at the beauty of their world and Ripley observes that she's a stranger to Earth herself... Ripley has become the alien. I was actually only going to give this film a 7 but thinking of that final scene I've decided to give it 8.

    Thank god for the end. This film was almost as ugly as then third and no where near the first 2. This film brings back Ripley as a robot sort of thing since they wanted to have the alien in her so they made her and kept the alien and her alive. This film is as ugly and dark as the third one with a bad script to add on. The aliens have brains in this on as to escape their prison, they kill him he of their own, which the acid blood causes the floor to melt and burn and they escape. Then its downhill from there with bad fight scenes, lame horror, and revealing a new alien that is a little neat as it kills the mother alien and then takes Ripley in as its mother. The only scene I liked was the one that showed the room of all failed attempts cloning Ripley and seeing the only one that lived until Ripley burned it and the others. It was a end to a bad series which is not fair to say cause of the first 2, but the other 2 were just so bad.

    Prometheus was a wonderful surprise after the holidays this year; family went to Prometheus and none of us reviewed the title or content before going; when I saw Ridley Scott's name I was optimistic, then amazed and thrilled with the presentation as I have all the ALIEN movies memorized backwards and forwards; the family then wanted to know more about the ALIEN series; in 4 days we watched all the re-worked Alien movies, of the 4, I was most disappointed with Resurrection, I was hoping for extended character development in the same way Alien 3 was fixed; no doubt the the Alien 3 "assembly cut" benefited most from. I think Alien 4 could have also but like the French director said I think he already put out the best he could with what he had. I liked it a little more. The BLUE RAY pictures are great; not like Prometheus, but worth the time to pickup from your local library, pop it in, crank the sound and watch on a 60inch LCD. Alien 1, 2, 3 all benefit from BlueRay tech and presentation! ALIEN 2 , a.k.a. ALIENS will always be my favorite! Another GLORIOUS DAY IN THE CORPS!!!!

    When I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie,my first reaction was "Is this some kind of joke???".Well if it was a joke,it would have been in very poor taste,unfortunately it's not. I would like to point out,I was completely alright with how "Alien 3" ended and I liked the movie itself,sure it wasn't as good as the original and "Aliens",but for me it was a satisfying way to end the series."Alien:Resurrection" was completely unnecessary and the film itself seems more like a spoof than a sequel. First of all-the characters are flat.They are also inconsistent-One minuter Winona Ryder's character tries to give Ripley support and the next she literally says "F**k you" to Ripley.The black guy can do his fancy ricocheting bullets thingy,but he can't shoot a giant alien right in front of him.It seems the writers forgot what character development was until half-way into the film,where there is actually an attempt of giving the characters some depth,but then the writers said "F**k it,let's throw in some more aliens!Better yet,let's throw in a last minute explanation to create a new alien.Oh this is a good one,let's make the viewers sympathise for the damn thing,although they've seen it for less then 10 minutes."What were they thinking??? Another huge problem is the CGI-it sucks,but the director doesn't seem to agree,because there are so many pointless CGI scenes,but the movie was made in a period when Hollywood thought CGI was incredibly realistic and awesome.Some of the death scenes are creative,but really over-the- top and ridiculous.The suspense from the previous films is also missing. "Alien:Resurrection" is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen.Stay the hell away from it.

    Say what you will, this installment definitely saved the saga from the premature demise that was almost engineered by Sigourney Weaver when she indulged in way too much PMS hostility toward the series while making Alien3. The slaughter of all our darlings during the course of that film spelled desolation and oblivion for any hope of further sequels. But, lo and behold! Jeunet & company have done the impossible in a very houdinian escape from what looked like certain destruction with this film! I say HOORAH! Yes, it's very icky and slimy in its own way, but is that out of keeping with this tradition? Au contraire! This film also has its own original brand of beauty and elegance, perhaps more than any other installment thus far. Each installment makes its own special contribution: Alien=Atmosphere and suspense. Aliens=Action, adventure, and human interest. Resurrection=Visual effects and sheer creativity. Aliens3=Stupidity and forgettable-ness! The character development is wonderful. Ripley as Alien/human hybrid is a revelation of sinister anti-heroism. The dialog is snappy and often very funny. Ron Perlman is also wonderful as the hulking merc who is devoid of etiquette. I was so relieved when I saw this film! Once again, a great director adds his own genius to the anthology. But I still regret that David Fincher didn't get his fair shot at contributing with Alien3. If only Ms. Weaver had been in a less bitchy frame of mind back then (sigh!) Ah, well! As the French say, C'est la vie!

A brand new member to the Alien family, while perhaps not as scary as intended, provides some good moments at the climax. While suffering in comparison to it's predecessors, on it's own terms it makes for good, gruesome, comic-book-style mayhem.

    Alien is rightfully considered possibly the finest horror/sci-fi film of all time (The Thing and The Fly its' only real competitors, interestingly both remakes). Aliens is the best sci-fi/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered. Alien; Resurrection was a valiant attempt to put things right and my boy Joss Whedon does a commendable job. But he had a long way to climb after the debacle of Alien 3. Really Resurrection isn't a great film overall but it has some terrific things about it. Sigourney is great as always, Wionna does OK in her role, the relationship between Cal and Ripley 8 is brilliant and spawned a thousand slash fanfics. You can see the beginnings of Firefly here, even down to a prototype Jane and River. The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens. Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films). She and Cal gaze at the beauty of their world and Ripley observes that she's a stranger to Earth herself... Ripley has become the alien. I was actually only going to give this film a 7 but thinking of that final scene I've decided to give it 8.

    Thank god for the end. This film was almost as ugly as then third and no where near the first 2. This film brings back Ripley as a robot sort of thing since they wanted to have the alien in her so they made her and kept the alien and her alive. This film is as ugly and dark as the third one with a bad script to add on. The aliens have brains in this on as to escape their prison, they kill him he of their own, which the acid blood causes the floor to melt and burn and they escape. Then its downhill from there with bad fight scenes, lame horror, and revealing a new alien that is a little neat as it kills the mother alien and then takes Ripley in as its mother. The only scene I liked was the one that showed the room of all failed attempts cloning Ripley and seeing the only one that lived until Ripley burned it and the others. It was a end to a bad series which is not fair to say cause of the first 2, but the other 2 were just so bad.

    Prometheus was a wonderful surprise after the holidays this year; family went to Prometheus and none of us reviewed the title or content before going; when I saw Ridley Scott's name I was optimistic, then amazed and thrilled with the presentation as I have all the ALIEN movies memorized backwards and forwards; the family then wanted to know more about the ALIEN series; in 4 days we watched all the re-worked Alien movies, of the 4, I was most disappointed with Resurrection, I was hoping for extended character development in the same way Alien 3 was fixed; no doubt the the Alien 3 "assembly cut" benefited most from. I think Alien 4 could have also but like the French director said I think he already put out the best he could with what he had. I liked it a little more. The BLUE RAY pictures are great; not like Prometheus, but worth the time to pickup from your local library, pop it in, crank the sound and watch on a 60inch LCD. Alien 1, 2, 3 all benefit from BlueRay tech and presentation! ALIEN 2 , a.k.a. ALIENS will always be my favorite! Another GLORIOUS DAY IN THE CORPS!!!!

    When I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie,my first reaction was "Is this some kind of joke???".Well if it was a joke,it would have been in very poor taste,unfortunately it's not. I would like to point out,I was completely alright with how "Alien 3" ended and I liked the movie itself,sure it wasn't as good as the original and "Aliens",but for me it was a satisfying way to end the series."Alien:Resurrection" was completely unnecessary and the film itself seems more like a spoof than a sequel. First of all-the characters are flat.They are also inconsistent-One minuter Winona Ryder's character tries to give Ripley support and the next she literally says "F**k you" to Ripley.The black guy can do his fancy ricocheting bullets thingy,but he can't shoot a giant alien right in front of him.It seems the writers forgot what character development was until half-way into the film,where there is actually an attempt of giving the characters some depth,but then the writers said "F**k it,let's throw in some more aliens!Better yet,let's throw in a last minute explanation to create a new alien.Oh this is a good one,let's make the viewers sympathise for the damn thing,although they've seen it for less then 10 minutes."What were they thinking??? Another huge problem is the CGI-it sucks,but the director doesn't seem to agree,because there are so many pointless CGI scenes,but the movie was made in a period when Hollywood thought CGI was incredibly realistic and awesome.Some of the death scenes are creative,but really over-the- top and ridiculous.The suspense from the previous films is also missing. "Alien:Resurrection" is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen.Stay the hell away from it.

    Say what you will, this installment definitely saved the saga from the premature demise that was almost engineered by Sigourney Weaver when she indulged in way too much PMS hostility toward the series while making Alien3. The slaughter of all our darlings during the course of that film spelled desolation and oblivion for any hope of further sequels. But, lo and behold! Jeunet & company have done the impossible in a very houdinian escape from what looked like certain destruction with this film! I say HOORAH! Yes, it's very icky and slimy in its own way, but is that out of keeping with this tradition? Au contraire! This film also has its own original brand of beauty and elegance, perhaps more than any other installment thus far. Each installment makes its own special contribution: Alien=Atmosphere and suspense. Aliens=Action, adventure, and human interest. Resurrection=Visual effects and sheer creativity. Aliens3=Stupidity and forgettable-ness! The character development is wonderful. Ripley as Alien/human hybrid is a revelation of sinister anti-heroism. The dialog is snappy and often very funny. Ron Perlman is also wonderful as the hulking merc who is devoid of etiquette. I was so relieved when I saw this film! Once again, a great director adds his own genius to the anthology. But I still regret that David Fincher didn't get his fair shot at contributing with Alien3. If only Ms. Weaver had been in a less bitchy frame of mind back then (sigh!) Ah, well! As the French say, C'est la vie!

    Well, I did not want to watch this title even being an Alien/Predator franchise lover and also Jean-Pierre Jeunet devoted fan since third Alien movie by David Fincher was awful and this one has low ratings. So I pulled myself together, pressed 'Play' button and what do you think happened? It was pretty interesting from its very beginning to the end! I've just been watching it and didn't even go to take one more cup of tea or something.. Great acting made me love these actors more than I did, Ron Perlman did his best, Dominique Pinon was not so good though.. These scary scenery were just like from other Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movies, especially in that lab scene.. But the real question is WHY did they killed that baby?! It was really cute! It was looking at its 'mom' and saying 'please, why are you leaving, don't, why are you trying to kill me, mom?' I almost cried. She could make it not to kill people, the child was supposed to listen to its 'mom'.. And I don't know really why the hell it killed the queen, she was just like a woman and I didn't expect that baby's gonna kill her.. Finally, from now on it's in my favorites. One more great Alien movie. One more great Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie.

    While I found "Alien 3" to not be that great and be extremely mediocre, "Alien: Resurrection" proves to be the worst of the "Alien" films in my opinion and does many things that I find infuriating in film. The third film had a great ending to it with the intense game of cat and mouse through the prison and Ripley's sacrifice so that the Weyland Corporation could not get its hands on the alien. Everything is tied up nicely and there are no lose ends. Then, along comes "Alien: Resurrection", which is the true road to ruin for the "Alien" movies. We open up at least a thousand years later after the events of "Alien 3". Ripley has been cloned and the Weyland Corporation is also trying to recreate the alien species, succeeding in making several clones using kidnapped humans collected by mercenaries as hosts. The aliens soon mature and escape, damaging the ship. The first things that really infuriated me with this movie was with Ripley being alive because she was cloned. I do not like characters who die to come back to life in movies unless they are like ghosts or the method for their resurrection is set up ahead of time. So, Ripley is alive because she was the star of the first three films so they need her to be in it or it will not be a true "Alien" film. That is what it felt like to me. My next biggest issue was with the new creature introduced in the movie. The three movies before it had clever ideas, even if they were mild. "Alien" introduced us to the species and the face-huggers, "Aliens" gave us the idea of a queen alien, and the third one had an alien but since it came out of a dog and not a human, it behaved a little like a dog would. What this film did was not even remotely clever. They had a half- human half-alien hybrid. This just screams to me that they wanted something new but could not think of something remotely clever so they did one of the most clich&eacute; things imaginable, mixing a human with the creature. Another problem I had was with the movie all together. It had nothing for the audience besides aliens hunting down and killing the humans. The characters were uninteresting--not that the characters from the first three films were works of art but they at least made you care--so we did not care if they succeeded or not as the only person we might be able to relate to is Ripley, but she's a clone and not the real Ripley so there is nothing from that. The film is played off more as aliens in "Poseidon" as the characters are escaping from a ship, going through different obstacles while aliens instead of rising water are following them. There is little tension as they could easily defeat the aliens. They have firepower and there is less than ten aliens. In "Alien" and "Alien 3", they had little to no weapons and in "Aliens" they had weapons but not enough to fight them all. There was tension with that. In this, the characters are all armed and there are few enough aliens that they could just fight them off, ergo, no tension. To try and compensate for this, they have one mercenary in a wheelchair and a guy with an embryo in him that is about to erupt from his chest, but both of these fail to bring tension to the audience. While I would watch "Alien: Resurrection" over other films I have seen, the film fails on multiple levels and takes the "Alien" franchise from having an ending that was pretty good to a lousy ending where we are left with our surviving characters sitting around with a "what happens now?" thought running through the audience's brains.

    An absolute Gorefest. Probably, an inevitable inclusion in the popular Franchise considering the Creature and where it had yet to go. Over the top and then some. Not a bad idea in the ongoing Saga of the "Thing from Another World". Fans are mixed on this with most leaning to the "forget this one and call it a trilogy" and many stick to that Mantra to this day. But lets take a look. Speaking of look, this is a slick, funk-punk, biker bash of slime and grime with a sheen of Violence that Fangoria types might appreciate. The beyond the pale goings-on that have a certain Pulpy charm is almost ruined by one Scene that is so gut-wrenching and ugly that, after viewing, the pit of your stomach may never be the same. Its the Window Vacuum Scene of course. But that God-Awful display aside, that dare it be said, truly sucks, this mostly can pass as a pretty good, very violent and horrific extension that, let's be honest, was certainly not going to end when there are cash registers to ring, to this day is still trying to expand.

    So what I do is to buy the entire Alien Quadrilogy, and sit down for a marathon. The first two were awesome, the third being alright, and then I look forward to seeing how they could continue after killing off Ripley. And with Alien Resurrection, they proved that the third movie should have been the last one. Not sure if anyone notices, but the crew following Ripley in each movie have a lot to say for the atmosphere. The original movie had a spaceship crew, then come the marines, and after that come a bunch of space convicts. Sorry, but I can't see the people in this movie as anything else than a bunch of retards. Some scenes I loathe: the scientist that uses steam to tame an Alien, scenes with that gun-guy ricocheting bullets via the walls and things (it's just not going to work), the way Ripley shows little fear of the Aliens anymore, and (good grief) the new Alien introduced at the end of the movie: Clone-Ripley's hybrid-humanoid-alien-beast-thing. Let's take a look at the last one. To me, he became an instant Jar Jar Binks of the Alien universe. My first thought was: "NO". When they kill it, it even looks at Ripley with sad eyes and desperately cries "Mommy!" Dear producers, think for a second: this thing had been alive for almost five minutes, and now it has learned English. Just the ending in itself kills everything with the Aliens: the danger, the sinister promise of certain death, and the pure genius characteristic design of HR Giger. Just sad. Please, no more Alien movies after this one. Some things can not be repaired.

    In an interview Ridley Scott cited the old Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant comics as one of many inspirations for Alien. Of all the films, the one that most resembles Heavy Metal is Jean-Pierre Jeunet's demented, over-the-top, but not unentertaining fourth entry. This is another entry that uh...alienated fans, and it certainly doesn't have any of the atmosphere or suspense of even Alien 3. Visually, it's quite uneven. Production design is impressive, effects not always so - even in 1997. Gore is ramped up to 11. Indeed we see far more blood and guts in this one than all the others put together. A number of critics had issues with the humour on display, but I personally found this refreshing. It was interesting to see a more lighthearted display in an Alien segment after the deadly seriousness of the first three. Where it most delivers is in Sigourney, excellent again, this time as a superhuman part-alien clone of Ripley, and in the frantic moments when the characters are facing off against the aliens. The monsters are menacing as always, and this time they're not above sacrificing one of their own for their own benefit. A brand new member to the Alien family, while perhaps not as scary as intended, provides some good moments at the climax. While suffering in comparison to it's predecessors, on it's own terms it makes for good, gruesome, comic-book-style mayhem.

    Alien is rightfully considered possibly the finest horror/sci-fi film of all time (The Thing and The Fly its' only real competitors, interestingly both remakes). Aliens is the best sci-fi/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered.

The third film had a great ending to it with the intense game of cat and mouse through the prison and Ripley's sacrifice so that the Weyland Corporation could not get its hands on the alien. Everything is tied up nicely and there are no lose ends. Then, along comes "Alien: Resurrection", which is the true road to ruin for the "Alien" movies. We open up at least a thousand years later after the events of "Alien 3". Ripley has been cloned and the Weyland Corporation is also trying to recreate the alien species, succeeding in making several clones using kidnapped humans collected by mercenaries as hosts. The aliens soon mature and escape, damaging the ship. The first things that really infuriated me with this movie was with Ripley being alive because she was cloned. I do not like characters who die to come back to life in movies unless they are like ghosts or the method for their resurrection is set up ahead of time. So, Ripley is alive because she was the star of the first three films so they need her to be in it or it will not be a true "Alien" film. That is what it felt like to me. My next biggest issue was with the new creature introduced in the movie. The three movies before it had clever ideas, even if they were mild. "Alien" introduced us to the species and the face-huggers, "Aliens" gave us the idea of a queen alien, and the third one had an alien but since it came out of a dog and not a human, it behaved a little like a dog would. What this film did was not even remotely clever. They had a half- human half-alien hybrid. This just screams to me that they wanted something new but could not think of something remotely clever so they did one of the most clich&eacute; things imaginable, mixing a human with the creature. Another problem I had was with the movie all together. It had nothing for the audience besides aliens hunting down and killing the humans. The characters were uninteresting--not that the characters from the first three films were works of art but they at least made you care--so we did not care if they succeeded or not as the only person we might be able to relate to is Ripley, but she's a clone and not the real Ripley so there is nothing from that. The film is played off more as aliens in "Poseidon" as the characters are escaping from a ship, going through different obstacles while aliens instead of rising water are following them. There is little tension as they could easily defeat the aliens. They have firepower and there is less than ten aliens. In "Alien" and "Alien 3", they had little to no weapons and in "Aliens" they had weapons but not enough to fight them all. There was tension with that. In this, the characters are all armed and there are few enough aliens that they could just fight them off, ergo, no tension. To try and compensate for this, they have one mercenary in a wheelchair and a guy with an embryo in him that is about to erupt from his chest, but both of these fail to bring tension to the audience. While I would watch "Alien: Resurrection" over other films I have seen, the film fails on multiple levels and takes the "Alien" franchise from having an ending that was pretty good to a lousy ending where we are left with our surviving characters sitting around with a "what happens now?" thought running through the audience's brains.

    An absolute Gorefest. Probably, an inevitable inclusion in the popular Franchise considering the Creature and where it had yet to go. Over the top and then some. Not a bad idea in the ongoing Saga of the "Thing from Another World". Fans are mixed on this with most leaning to the "forget this one and call it a trilogy" and many stick to that Mantra to this day. But lets take a look. Speaking of look, this is a slick, funk-punk, biker bash of slime and grime with a sheen of Violence that Fangoria types might appreciate. The beyond the pale goings-on that have a certain Pulpy charm is almost ruined by one Scene that is so gut-wrenching and ugly that, after viewing, the pit of your stomach may never be the same. Its the Window Vacuum Scene of course. But that God-Awful display aside, that dare it be said, truly sucks, this mostly can pass as a pretty good, very violent and horrific extension that, let's be honest, was certainly not going to end when there are cash registers to ring, to this day is still trying to expand.

    So what I do is to buy the entire Alien Quadrilogy, and sit down for a marathon. The first two were awesome, the third being alright, and then I look forward to seeing how they could continue after killing off Ripley. And with Alien Resurrection, they proved that the third movie should have been the last one. Not sure if anyone notices, but the crew following Ripley in each movie have a lot to say for the atmosphere. The original movie had a spaceship crew, then come the marines, and after that come a bunch of space convicts. Sorry, but I can't see the people in this movie as anything else than a bunch of retards. Some scenes I loathe: the scientist that uses steam to tame an Alien, scenes with that gun-guy ricocheting bullets via the walls and things (it's just not going to work), the way Ripley shows little fear of the Aliens anymore, and (good grief) the new Alien introduced at the end of the movie: Clone-Ripley's hybrid-humanoid-alien-beast-thing. Let's take a look at the last one. To me, he became an instant Jar Jar Binks of the Alien universe. My first thought was: "NO". When they kill it, it even looks at Ripley with sad eyes and desperately cries "Mommy!" Dear producers, think for a second: this thing had been alive for almost five minutes, and now it has learned English. Just the ending in itself kills everything with the Aliens: the danger, the sinister promise of certain death, and the pure genius characteristic design of HR Giger. Just sad. Please, no more Alien movies after this one. Some things can not be repaired.

    In an interview Ridley Scott cited the old Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant comics as one of many inspirations for Alien. Of all the films, the one that most resembles Heavy Metal is Jean-Pierre Jeunet's demented, over-the-top, but not unentertaining fourth entry. This is another entry that uh...alienated fans, and it certainly doesn't have any of the atmosphere or suspense of even Alien 3. Visually, it's quite uneven. Production design is impressive, effects not always so - even in 1997. Gore is ramped up to 11. Indeed we see far more blood and guts in this one than all the others put together. A number of critics had issues with the humour on display, but I personally found this refreshing. It was interesting to see a more lighthearted display in an Alien segment after the deadly seriousness of the first three. Where it most delivers is in Sigourney, excellent again, this time as a superhuman part-alien clone of Ripley, and in the frantic moments when the characters are facing off against the aliens. The monsters are menacing as always, and this time they're not above sacrificing one of their own for their own benefit. A brand new member to the Alien family, while perhaps not as scary as intended, provides some good moments at the climax. While suffering in comparison to it's predecessors, on it's own terms it makes for good, gruesome, comic-book-style mayhem.

    Alien is rightfully considered possibly the finest horror/sci-fi film of all time (The Thing and The Fly its' only real competitors, interestingly both remakes). Aliens is the best sci-fi/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered. Alien; Resurrection was a valiant attempt to put things right and my boy Joss Whedon does a commendable job. But he had a long way to climb after the debacle of Alien 3. Really Resurrection isn't a great film overall but it has some terrific things about it. Sigourney is great as always, Wionna does OK in her role, the relationship between Cal and Ripley 8 is brilliant and spawned a thousand slash fanfics. You can see the beginnings of Firefly here, even down to a prototype Jane and River. The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens. Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films). She and Cal gaze at the beauty of their world and Ripley observes that she's a stranger to Earth herself... Ripley has become the alien. I was actually only going to give this film a 7 but thinking of that final scene I've decided to give it 8.

    Thank god for the end. This film was almost as ugly as then third and no where near the first 2. This film brings back Ripley as a robot sort of thing since they wanted to have the alien in her so they made her and kept the alien and her alive. This film is as ugly and dark as the third one with a bad script to add on. The aliens have brains in this on as to escape their prison, they kill him he of their own, which the acid blood causes the floor to melt and burn and they escape. Then its downhill from there with bad fight scenes, lame horror, and revealing a new alien that is a little neat as it kills the mother alien and then takes Ripley in as its mother. The only scene I liked was the one that showed the room of all failed attempts cloning Ripley and seeing the only one that lived until Ripley burned it and the others. It was a end to a bad series which is not fair to say cause of the first 2, but the other 2 were just so bad.

    Prometheus was a wonderful surprise after the holidays this year; family went to Prometheus and none of us reviewed the title or content before going; when I saw Ridley Scott's name I was optimistic, then amazed and thrilled with the presentation as I have all the ALIEN movies memorized backwards and forwards; the family then wanted to know more about the ALIEN series; in 4 days we watched all the re-worked Alien movies, of the 4, I was most disappointed with Resurrection, I was hoping for extended character development in the same way Alien 3 was fixed; no doubt the the Alien 3 "assembly cut" benefited most from. I think Alien 4 could have also but like the French director said I think he already put out the best he could with what he had. I liked it a little more. The BLUE RAY pictures are great; not like Prometheus, but worth the time to pickup from your local library, pop it in, crank the sound and watch on a 60inch LCD. Alien 1, 2, 3 all benefit from BlueRay tech and presentation! ALIEN 2 , a.k.a. ALIENS will always be my favorite! Another GLORIOUS DAY IN THE CORPS!!!!

    When I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie,my first reaction was "Is this some kind of joke???".Well if it was a joke,it would have been in very poor taste,unfortunately it's not. I would like to point out,I was completely alright with how "Alien 3" ended and I liked the movie itself,sure it wasn't as good as the original and "Aliens",but for me it was a satisfying way to end the series."Alien:Resurrection" was completely unnecessary and the film itself seems more like a spoof than a sequel. First of all-the characters are flat.They are also inconsistent-One minuter Winona Ryder's character tries to give Ripley support and the next she literally says "F**k you" to Ripley.The black guy can do his fancy ricocheting bullets thingy,but he can't shoot a giant alien right in front of him.It seems the writers forgot what character development was until half-way into the film,where there is actually an attempt of giving the characters some depth,but then the writers said "F**k it,let's throw in some more aliens!Better yet,let's throw in a last minute explanation to create a new alien.Oh this is a good one,let's make the viewers sympathise for the damn thing,although they've seen it for less then 10 minutes."What were they thinking??? Another huge problem is the CGI-it sucks,but the director doesn't seem to agree,because there are so many pointless CGI scenes,but the movie was made in a period when Hollywood thought CGI was incredibly realistic and awesome.Some of the death scenes are creative,but really over-the- top and ridiculous.The suspense from the previous films is also missing. "Alien:Resurrection" is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen.Stay the hell away from it.

    Say what you will, this installment definitely saved the saga from the premature demise that was almost engineered by Sigourney Weaver when she indulged in way too much PMS hostility toward the series while making Alien3. The slaughter of all our darlings during the course of that film spelled desolation and oblivion for any hope of further sequels. But, lo and behold! Jeunet & company have done the impossible in a very houdinian escape from what looked like certain destruction with this film! I say HOORAH! Yes, it's very icky and slimy in its own way, but is that out of keeping with this tradition? Au contraire! This film also has its own original brand of beauty and elegance, perhaps more than any other installment thus far. Each installment makes its own special contribution: Alien=Atmosphere and suspense. Aliens=Action, adventure, and human interest. Resurrection=Visual effects and sheer creativity. Aliens3=Stupidity and forgettable-ness! The character development is wonderful. Ripley as Alien/human hybrid is a revelation of sinister anti-heroism. The dialog is snappy and often very funny. Ron Perlman is also wonderful as the hulking merc who is devoid of etiquette. I was so relieved when I saw this film! Once again, a great director adds his own genius to the anthology. But I still regret that David Fincher didn't get his fair shot at contributing with Alien3. If only Ms. Weaver had been in a less bitchy frame of mind back then (sigh!) Ah, well! As the French say, C'est la vie!

    Well, I did not want to watch this title even being an Alien/Predator franchise lover and also Jean-Pierre Jeunet devoted fan since third Alien movie by David Fincher was awful and this one has low ratings. So I pulled myself together, pressed 'Play' button and what do you think happened? It was pretty interesting from its very beginning to the end! I've just been watching it and didn't even go to take one more cup of tea or something.. Great acting made me love these actors more than I did, Ron Perlman did his best, Dominique Pinon was not so good though.. These scary scenery were just like from other Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movies, especially in that lab scene.. But the real question is WHY did they killed that baby?! It was really cute! It was looking at its 'mom' and saying 'please, why are you leaving, don't, why are you trying to kill me, mom?' I almost cried. She could make it not to kill people, the child was supposed to listen to its 'mom'.. And I don't know really why the hell it killed the queen, she was just like a woman and I didn't expect that baby's gonna kill her.. Finally, from now on it's in my favorites. One more great Alien movie. One more great Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie.

It was a end to a bad series which is not fair to say cause of the first 2, but the other 2 were just so bad.

    Prometheus was a wonderful surprise after the holidays this year; family went to Prometheus and none of us reviewed the title or content before going; when I saw Ridley Scott's name I was optimistic, then amazed and thrilled with the presentation as I have all the ALIEN movies memorized backwards and forwards; the family then wanted to know more about the ALIEN series; in 4 days we watched all the re-worked Alien movies, of the 4, I was most disappointed with Resurrection, I was hoping for extended character development in the same way Alien 3 was fixed; no doubt the the Alien 3 "assembly cut" benefited most from. I think Alien 4 could have also but like the French director said I think he already put out the best he could with what he had. I liked it a little more. The BLUE RAY pictures are great; not like Prometheus, but worth the time to pickup from your local library, pop it in, crank the sound and watch on a 60inch LCD. Alien 1, 2, 3 all benefit from BlueRay tech and presentation! ALIEN 2 , a.k.a. ALIENS will always be my favorite! Another GLORIOUS DAY IN THE CORPS!!!!

    When I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie,my first reaction was "Is this some kind of joke???".Well if it was a joke,it would have been in very poor taste,unfortunately it's not. I would like to point out,I was completely alright with how "Alien 3" ended and I liked the movie itself,sure it wasn't as good as the original and "Aliens",but for me it was a satisfying way to end the series."Alien:Resurrection" was completely unnecessary and the film itself seems more like a spoof than a sequel. First of all-the characters are flat.They are also inconsistent-One minuter Winona Ryder's character tries to give Ripley support and the next she literally says "F**k you" to Ripley.The black guy can do his fancy ricocheting bullets thingy,but he can't shoot a giant alien right in front of him.It seems the writers forgot what character development was until half-way into the film,where there is actually an attempt of giving the characters some depth,but then the writers said "F**k it,let's throw in some more aliens!Better yet,let's throw in a last minute explanation to create a new alien.Oh this is a good one,let's make the viewers sympathise for the damn thing,although they've seen it for less then 10 minutes."What were they thinking??? Another huge problem is the CGI-it sucks,but the director doesn't seem to agree,because there are so many pointless CGI scenes,but the movie was made in a period when Hollywood thought CGI was incredibly realistic and awesome.Some of the death scenes are creative,but really over-the- top and ridiculous.The suspense from the previous films is also missing. "Alien:Resurrection" is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen.Stay the hell away from it.

    Say what you will, this installment definitely saved the saga from the premature demise that was almost engineered by Sigourney Weaver when she indulged in way too much PMS hostility toward the series while making Alien3. The slaughter of all our darlings during the course of that film spelled desolation and oblivion for any hope of further sequels. But, lo and behold! Jeunet & company have done the impossible in a very houdinian escape from what looked like certain destruction with this film! I say HOORAH! Yes, it's very icky and slimy in its own way, but is that out of keeping with this tradition? Au contraire! This film also has its own original brand of beauty and elegance, perhaps more than any other installment thus far. Each installment makes its own special contribution: Alien=Atmosphere and suspense. Aliens=Action, adventure, and human interest. Resurrection=Visual effects and sheer creativity. Aliens3=Stupidity and forgettable-ness! The character development is wonderful. Ripley as Alien/human hybrid is a revelation of sinister anti-heroism. The dialog is snappy and often very funny. Ron Perlman is also wonderful as the hulking merc who is devoid of etiquette. I was so relieved when I saw this film! Once again, a great director adds his own genius to the anthology. But I still regret that David Fincher didn't get his fair shot at contributing with Alien3. If only Ms. Weaver had been in a less bitchy frame of mind back then (sigh!) Ah, well! As the French say, C'est la vie!

    Well, I did not want to watch this title even being an Alien/Predator franchise lover and also Jean-Pierre Jeunet devoted fan since third Alien movie by David Fincher was awful and this one has low ratings. So I pulled myself together, pressed 'Play' button and what do you think happened? It was pretty interesting from its very beginning to the end! I've just been watching it and didn't even go to take one more cup of tea or something.. Great acting made me love these actors more than I did, Ron Perlman did his best, Dominique Pinon was not so good though.. These scary scenery were just like from other Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movies, especially in that lab scene.. But the real question is WHY did they killed that baby?! It was really cute! It was looking at its 'mom' and saying 'please, why are you leaving, don't, why are you trying to kill me, mom?' I almost cried. She could make it not to kill people, the child was supposed to listen to its 'mom'.. And I don't know really why the hell it killed the queen, she was just like a woman and I didn't expect that baby's gonna kill her.. Finally, from now on it's in my favorites. One more great Alien movie. One more great Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie.

    While I found "Alien 3" to not be that great and be extremely mediocre, "Alien: Resurrection" proves to be the worst of the "Alien" films in my opinion and does many things that I find infuriating in film. The third film had a great ending to it with the intense game of cat and mouse through the prison and Ripley's sacrifice so that the Weyland Corporation could not get its hands on the alien. Everything is tied up nicely and there are no lose ends. Then, along comes "Alien: Resurrection", which is the true road to ruin for the "Alien" movies. We open up at least a thousand years later after the events of "Alien 3". Ripley has been cloned and the Weyland Corporation is also trying to recreate the alien species, succeeding in making several clones using kidnapped humans collected by mercenaries as hosts. The aliens soon mature and escape, damaging the ship. The first things that really infuriated me with this movie was with Ripley being alive because she was cloned. I do not like characters who die to come back to life in movies unless they are like ghosts or the method for their resurrection is set up ahead of time. So, Ripley is alive because she was the star of the first three films so they need her to be in it or it will not be a true "Alien" film. That is what it felt like to me. My next biggest issue was with the new creature introduced in the movie. The three movies before it had clever ideas, even if they were mild. "Alien" introduced us to the species and the face-huggers, "Aliens" gave us the idea of a queen alien, and the third one had an alien but since it came out of a dog and not a human, it behaved a little like a dog would. What this film did was not even remotely clever. They had a half- human half-alien hybrid. This just screams to me that they wanted something new but could not think of something remotely clever so they did one of the most clich&eacute; things imaginable, mixing a human with the creature. Another problem I had was with the movie all together. It had nothing for the audience besides aliens hunting down and killing the humans. The characters were uninteresting--not that the characters from the first three films were works of art but they at least made you care--so we did not care if they succeeded or not as the only person we might be able to relate to is Ripley, but she's a clone and not the real Ripley so there is nothing from that. The film is played off more as aliens in "Poseidon" as the characters are escaping from a ship, going through different obstacles while aliens instead of rising water are following them. There is little tension as they could easily defeat the aliens. They have firepower and there is less than ten aliens. In "Alien" and "Alien 3", they had little to no weapons and in "Aliens" they had weapons but not enough to fight them all. There was tension with that. In this, the characters are all armed and there are few enough aliens that they could just fight them off, ergo, no tension. To try and compensate for this, they have one mercenary in a wheelchair and a guy with an embryo in him that is about to erupt from his chest, but both of these fail to bring tension to the audience. While I would watch "Alien: Resurrection" over other films I have seen, the film fails on multiple levels and takes the "Alien" franchise from having an ending that was pretty good to a lousy ending where we are left with our surviving characters sitting around with a "what happens now?" thought running through the audience's brains.

    An absolute Gorefest. Probably, an inevitable inclusion in the popular Franchise considering the Creature and where it had yet to go. Over the top and then some. Not a bad idea in the ongoing Saga of the "Thing from Another World". Fans are mixed on this with most leaning to the "forget this one and call it a trilogy" and many stick to that Mantra to this day. But lets take a look. Speaking of look, this is a slick, funk-punk, biker bash of slime and grime with a sheen of Violence that Fangoria types might appreciate. The beyond the pale goings-on that have a certain Pulpy charm is almost ruined by one Scene that is so gut-wrenching and ugly that, after viewing, the pit of your stomach may never be the same. Its the Window Vacuum Scene of course. But that God-Awful display aside, that dare it be said, truly sucks, this mostly can pass as a pretty good, very violent and horrific extension that, let's be honest, was certainly not going to end when there are cash registers to ring, to this day is still trying to expand.

    So what I do is to buy the entire Alien Quadrilogy, and sit down for a marathon. The first two were awesome, the third being alright, and then I look forward to seeing how they could continue after killing off Ripley. And with Alien Resurrection, they proved that the third movie should have been the last one. Not sure if anyone notices, but the crew following Ripley in each movie have a lot to say for the atmosphere. The original movie had a spaceship crew, then come the marines, and after that come a bunch of space convicts. Sorry, but I can't see the people in this movie as anything else than a bunch of retards. Some scenes I loathe: the scientist that uses steam to tame an Alien, scenes with that gun-guy ricocheting bullets via the walls and things (it's just not going to work), the way Ripley shows little fear of the Aliens anymore, and (good grief) the new Alien introduced at the end of the movie: Clone-Ripley's hybrid-humanoid-alien-beast-thing. Let's take a look at the last one. To me, he became an instant Jar Jar Binks of the Alien universe. My first thought was: "NO". When they kill it, it even looks at Ripley with sad eyes and desperately cries "Mommy!" Dear producers, think for a second: this thing had been alive for almost five minutes, and now it has learned English. Just the ending in itself kills everything with the Aliens: the danger, the sinister promise of certain death, and the pure genius characteristic design of HR Giger. Just sad. Please, no more Alien movies after this one. Some things can not be repaired.

    In an interview Ridley Scott cited the old Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant comics as one of many inspirations for Alien. Of all the films, the one that most resembles Heavy Metal is Jean-Pierre Jeunet's demented, over-the-top, but not unentertaining fourth entry. This is another entry that uh...alienated fans, and it certainly doesn't have any of the atmosphere or suspense of even Alien 3. Visually, it's quite uneven. Production design is impressive, effects not always so - even in 1997. Gore is ramped up to 11. Indeed we see far more blood and guts in this one than all the others put together. A number of critics had issues with the humour on display, but I personally found this refreshing. It was interesting to see a more lighthearted display in an Alien segment after the deadly seriousness of the first three. Where it most delivers is in Sigourney, excellent again, this time as a superhuman part-alien clone of Ripley, and in the frantic moments when the characters are facing off against the aliens. The monsters are menacing as always, and this time they're not above sacrificing one of their own for their own benefit. A brand new member to the Alien family, while perhaps not as scary as intended, provides some good moments at the climax. While suffering in comparison to it's predecessors, on it's own terms it makes for good, gruesome, comic-book-style mayhem.

    Alien is rightfully considered possibly the finest horror/sci-fi film of all time (The Thing and The Fly its' only real competitors, interestingly both remakes). Aliens is the best sci-fi/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered. Alien; Resurrection was a valiant attempt to put things right and my boy Joss Whedon does a commendable job. But he had a long way to climb after the debacle of Alien 3. Really Resurrection isn't a great film overall but it has some terrific things about it. Sigourney is great as always, Wionna does OK in her role, the relationship between Cal and Ripley 8 is brilliant and spawned a thousand slash fanfics. You can see the beginnings of Firefly here, even down to a prototype Jane and River. The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens. Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films). She and Cal gaze at the beauty of their world and Ripley observes that she's a stranger to Earth herself... Ripley has become the alien. I was actually only going to give this film a 7 but thinking of that final scene I've decided to give it 8.

    Thank god for the end. This film was almost as ugly as then third and no where near the first 2. This film brings back Ripley as a robot sort of thing since they wanted to have the alien in her so they made her and kept the alien and her alive. This film is as ugly and dark as the third one with a bad script to add on. The aliens have brains in this on as to escape their prison, they kill him he of their own, which the acid blood causes the floor to melt and burn and they escape. Then its downhill from there with bad fight scenes, lame horror, and revealing a new alien that is a little neat as it kills the mother alien and then takes Ripley in as its mother. The only scene I liked was the one that showed the room of all failed attempts cloning Ripley and seeing the only one that lived until Ripley burned it and the others. It was a end to a bad series which is not fair to say cause of the first 2, but the other 2 were just so bad.

    So what I do is to buy the entire Alien Quadrilogy, and sit down for a marathon. The first two were awesome, the third being alright, and then I look forward to seeing how they could continue after killing off Ripley. And with Alien Resurrection, they proved that the third movie should have been the last one. Not sure if anyone notices, but the crew following Ripley in each movie have a lot to say for the atmosphere. The original movie had a spaceship crew, then come the marines, and after that come a bunch of space convicts. Sorry, but I can't see the people in this movie as anything else than a bunch of retards. Some scenes I loathe: the scientist that uses steam to tame an Alien, scenes with that gun-guy ricocheting bullets via the walls and things (it's just not going to work), the way Ripley shows little fear of the Aliens anymore, and (good grief) the new Alien introduced at the end of the movie: Clone-Ripley's hybrid-humanoid-alien-beast-thing. Let's take a look at the last one. To me, he became an instant Jar Jar Binks of the Alien universe. My first thought was: "NO". When they kill it, it even looks at Ripley with sad eyes and desperately cries "Mommy!" Dear producers, think for a second: this thing had been alive for almost five minutes, and now it has learned English. Just the ending in itself kills everything with the Aliens: the danger, the sinister promise of certain death, and the pure genius characteristic design of HR Giger. Just sad. Please, no more Alien movies after this one. Some things can not be repaired.

    In an interview Ridley Scott cited the old Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant comics as one of many inspirations for Alien. Of all the films, the one that most resembles Heavy Metal is Jean-Pierre Jeunet's demented, over-the-top, but not unentertaining fourth entry. This is another entry that uh...alienated fans, and it certainly doesn't have any of the atmosphere or suspense of even Alien 3. Visually, it's quite uneven. Production design is impressive, effects not always so - even in 1997. Gore is ramped up to 11. Indeed we see far more blood and guts in this one than all the others put together. A number of critics had issues with the humour on display, but I personally found this refreshing. It was interesting to see a more lighthearted display in an Alien segment after the deadly seriousness of the first three. Where it most delivers is in Sigourney, excellent again, this time as a superhuman part-alien clone of Ripley, and in the frantic moments when the characters are facing off against the aliens. The monsters are menacing as always, and this time they're not above sacrificing one of their own for their own benefit. A brand new member to the Alien family, while perhaps not as scary as intended, provides some good moments at the climax. While suffering in comparison to it's predecessors, on it's own terms it makes for good, gruesome, comic-book-style mayhem.

    Alien is rightfully considered possibly the finest horror/sci-fi film of all time (The Thing and The Fly its' only real competitors, interestingly both remakes). Aliens is the best sci-fi/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered. Alien; Resurrection was a valiant attempt to put things right and my boy Joss Whedon does a commendable job. But he had a long way to climb after the debacle of Alien 3. Really Resurrection isn't a great film overall but it has some terrific things about it. Sigourney is great as always, Wionna does OK in her role, the relationship between Cal and Ripley 8 is brilliant and spawned a thousand slash fanfics. You can see the beginnings of Firefly here, even down to a prototype Jane and River. The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens. Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films). She and Cal gaze at the beauty of their world and Ripley observes that she's a stranger to Earth herself... Ripley has become the alien. I was actually only going to give this film a 7 but thinking of that final scene I've decided to give it 8.

    Thank god for the end. This film was almost as ugly as then third and no where near the first 2. This film brings back Ripley as a robot sort of thing since they wanted to have the alien in her so they made her and kept the alien and her alive. This film is as ugly and dark as the third one with a bad script to add on. The aliens have brains in this on as to escape their prison, they kill him he of their own, which the acid blood causes the floor to melt and burn and they escape. Then its downhill from there with bad fight scenes, lame horror, and revealing a new alien that is a little neat as it kills the mother alien and then takes Ripley in as its mother. The only scene I liked was the one that showed the room of all failed attempts cloning Ripley and seeing the only one that lived until Ripley burned it and the others. It was a end to a bad series which is not fair to say cause of the first 2, but the other 2 were just so bad.

    Prometheus was a wonderful surprise after the holidays this year; family went to Prometheus and none of us reviewed the title or content before going; when I saw Ridley Scott's name I was optimistic, then amazed and thrilled with the presentation as I have all the ALIEN movies memorized backwards and forwards; the family then wanted to know more about the ALIEN series; in 4 days we watched all the re-worked Alien movies, of the 4, I was most disappointed with Resurrection, I was hoping for extended character development in the same way Alien 3 was fixed; no doubt the the Alien 3 "assembly cut" benefited most from. I think Alien 4 could have also but like the French director said I think he already put out the best he could with what he had. I liked it a little more. The BLUE RAY pictures are great; not like Prometheus, but worth the time to pickup from your local library, pop it in, crank the sound and watch on a 60inch LCD. Alien 1, 2, 3 all benefit from BlueRay tech and presentation! ALIEN 2 , a.k.a. ALIENS will always be my favorite! Another GLORIOUS DAY IN THE CORPS!!!!

    When I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie,my first reaction was "Is this some kind of joke???".Well if it was a joke,it would have been in very poor taste,unfortunately it's not. I would like to point out,I was completely alright with how "Alien 3" ended and I liked the movie itself,sure it wasn't as good as the original and "Aliens",but for me it was a satisfying way to end the series."Alien:Resurrection" was completely unnecessary and the film itself seems more like a spoof than a sequel. First of all-the characters are flat.They are also inconsistent-One minuter Winona Ryder's character tries to give Ripley support and the next she literally says "F**k you" to Ripley.The black guy can do his fancy ricocheting bullets thingy,but he can't shoot a giant alien right in front of him.It seems the writers forgot what character development was until half-way into the film,where there is actually an attempt of giving the characters some depth,but then the writers said "F**k it,let's throw in some more aliens!Better yet,let's throw in a last minute explanation to create a new alien.Oh this is a good one,let's make the viewers sympathise for the damn thing,although they've seen it for less then 10 minutes."What were they thinking??? Another huge problem is the CGI-it sucks,but the director doesn't seem to agree,because there are so many pointless CGI scenes,but the movie was made in a period when Hollywood thought CGI was incredibly realistic and awesome.Some of the death scenes are creative,but really over-the- top and ridiculous.The suspense from the previous films is also missing. "Alien:Resurrection" is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen.Stay the hell away from it.

    Say what you will, this installment definitely saved the saga from the premature demise that was almost engineered by Sigourney Weaver when she indulged in way too much PMS hostility toward the series while making Alien3. The slaughter of all our darlings during the course of that film spelled desolation and oblivion for any hope of further sequels. But, lo and behold! Jeunet & company have done the impossible in a very houdinian escape from what looked like certain destruction with this film! I say HOORAH! Yes, it's very icky and slimy in its own way, but is that out of keeping with this tradition? Au contraire! This film also has its own original brand of beauty and elegance, perhaps more than any other installment thus far. Each installment makes its own special contribution: Alien=Atmosphere and suspense. Aliens=Action, adventure, and human interest. Resurrection=Visual effects and sheer creativity. Aliens3=Stupidity and forgettable-ness! The character development is wonderful. Ripley as Alien/human hybrid is a revelation of sinister anti-heroism. The dialog is snappy and often very funny. Ron Perlman is also wonderful as the hulking merc who is devoid of etiquette. I was so relieved when I saw this film! Once again, a great director adds his own genius to the anthology. But I still regret that David Fincher didn't get his fair shot at contributing with Alien3. If only Ms. Weaver had been in a less bitchy frame of mind back then (sigh!) Ah, well! As the French say, C'est la vie!

    Well, I did not want to watch this title even being an Alien/Predator franchise lover and also Jean-Pierre Jeunet devoted fan since third Alien movie by David Fincher was awful and this one has low ratings. So I pulled myself together, pressed 'Play' button and what do you think happened? It was pretty interesting from its very beginning to the end! I've just been watching it and didn't even go to take one more cup of tea or something.. Great acting made me love these actors more than I did, Ron Perlman did his best, Dominique Pinon was not so good though.. These scary scenery were just like from other Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movies, especially in that lab scene.. But the real question is WHY did they killed that baby?! It was really cute! It was looking at its 'mom' and saying 'please, why are you leaving, don't, why are you trying to kill me, mom?' I almost cried. She could make it not to kill people, the child was supposed to listen to its 'mom'.. And I don't know really why the hell it killed the queen, she was just like a woman and I didn't expect that baby's gonna kill her.. Finally, from now on it's in my favorites. One more great Alien movie. One more great Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie.

    While I found "Alien 3" to not be that great and be extremely mediocre, "Alien: Resurrection" proves to be the worst of the "Alien" films in my opinion and does many things that I find infuriating in film. The third film had a great ending to it with the intense game of cat and mouse through the prison and Ripley's sacrifice so that the Weyland Corporation could not get its hands on the alien. Everything is tied up nicely and there are no lose ends. Then, along comes "Alien: Resurrection", which is the true road to ruin for the "Alien" movies. We open up at least a thousand years later after the events of "Alien 3". Ripley has been cloned and the Weyland Corporation is also trying to recreate the alien species, succeeding in making several clones using kidnapped humans collected by mercenaries as hosts. The aliens soon mature and escape, damaging the ship. The first things that really infuriated me with this movie was with Ripley being alive because she was cloned. I do not like characters who die to come back to life in movies unless they are like ghosts or the method for their resurrection is set up ahead of time. So, Ripley is alive because she was the star of the first three films so they need her to be in it or it will not be a true "Alien" film. That is what it felt like to me. My next biggest issue was with the new creature introduced in the movie. The three movies before it had clever ideas, even if they were mild. "Alien" introduced us to the species and the face-huggers, "Aliens" gave us the idea of a queen alien, and the third one had an alien but since it came out of a dog and not a human, it behaved a little like a dog would. What this film did was not even remotely clever. They had a half- human half-alien hybrid. This just screams to me that they wanted something new but could not think of something remotely clever so they did one of the most clich&eacute; things imaginable, mixing a human with the creature. Another problem I had was with the movie all together. It had nothing for the audience besides aliens hunting down and killing the humans. The characters were uninteresting--not that the characters from the first three films were works of art but they at least made you care--so we did not care if they succeeded or not as the only person we might be able to relate to is Ripley, but she's a clone and not the real Ripley so there is nothing from that. The film is played off more as aliens in "Poseidon" as the characters are escaping from a ship, going through different obstacles while aliens instead of rising water are following them. There is little tension as they could easily defeat the aliens. They have firepower and there is less than ten aliens. In "Alien" and "Alien 3", they had little to no weapons and in "Aliens" they had weapons but not enough to fight them all. There was tension with that. In this, the characters are all armed and there are few enough aliens that they could just fight them off, ergo, no tension. To try and compensate for this, they have one mercenary in a wheelchair and a guy with an embryo in him that is about to erupt from his chest, but both of these fail to bring tension to the audience. While I would watch "Alien: Resurrection" over other films I have seen, the film fails on multiple levels and takes the "Alien" franchise from having an ending that was pretty good to a lousy ending where we are left with our surviving characters sitting around with a "what happens now?" thought running through the audience's brains.

    An absolute Gorefest. Probably, an inevitable inclusion in the popular Franchise considering the Creature and where it had yet to go. Over the top and then some. Not a bad idea in the ongoing Saga of the "Thing from Another World". Fans are mixed on this with most leaning to the "forget this one and call it a trilogy" and many stick to that Mantra to this day. But lets take a look. Speaking of look, this is a slick, funk-punk, biker bash of slime and grime with a sheen of Violence that Fangoria types might appreciate. The beyond the pale goings-on that have a certain Pulpy charm is almost ruined by one Scene that is so gut-wrenching and ugly that, after viewing, the pit of your stomach may never be the same. Its the Window Vacuum Scene of course. But that God-Awful display aside, that dare it be said, truly sucks, this mostly can pass as a pretty good, very violent and horrific extension that, let's be honest, was certainly not going to end when there are cash registers to ring, to this day is still trying to expand.

Aliens=Action, adventure, and human interest. Resurrection=Visual effects and sheer creativity. Aliens3=Stupidity and forgettable-ness! The character development is wonderful. Ripley as Alien/human hybrid is a revelation of sinister anti-heroism. The dialog is snappy and often very funny. Ron Perlman is also wonderful as the hulking merc who is devoid of etiquette. I was so relieved when I saw this film! Once again, a great director adds his own genius to the anthology. But I still regret that David Fincher didn't get his fair shot at contributing with Alien3. If only Ms. Weaver had been in a less bitchy frame of mind back then (sigh!) Ah, well! As the French say, C'est la vie!

    Well, I did not want to watch this title even being an Alien/Predator franchise lover and also Jean-Pierre Jeunet devoted fan since third Alien movie by David Fincher was awful and this one has low ratings. So I pulled myself together, pressed 'Play' button and what do you think happened? It was pretty interesting from its very beginning to the end! I've just been watching it and didn't even go to take one more cup of tea or something.. Great acting made me love these actors more than I did, Ron Perlman did his best, Dominique Pinon was not so good though.. These scary scenery were just like from other Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movies, especially in that lab scene.. But the real question is WHY did they killed that baby?! It was really cute! It was looking at its 'mom' and saying 'please, why are you leaving, don't, why are you trying to kill me, mom?' I almost cried. She could make it not to kill people, the child was supposed to listen to its 'mom'.. And I don't know really why the hell it killed the queen, she was just like a woman and I didn't expect that baby's gonna kill her.. Finally, from now on it's in my favorites. One more great Alien movie. One more great Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie.

    Resurrection is the death of the "Alien" franchise

    While I found "Alien 3" to not be that great and be extremely mediocre, "Alien: Resurrection" proves to be the worst of the "Alien" films in my opinion and does many things that I find infuriating in film. The third film had a great ending to it with the intense game of cat and mouse through the prison and Ripley's sacrifice so that the Weyland Corporation could not get its hands on the alien. Everything is tied up nicely and there are no lose ends. Then, along comes "Alien: Resurrection", which is the true road to ruin for the "Alien" movies. We open up at least a thousand years later after the events of "Alien 3". Ripley has been cloned and the Weyland Corporation is also trying to recreate the alien species, succeeding in making several clones using kidnapped humans collected by mercenaries as hosts. The aliens soon mature and escape, damaging the ship. The first things that really infuriated me with this movie was with Ripley being alive because she was cloned. I do not like characters who die to come back to life in movies unless they are like ghosts or the method for their resurrection is set up ahead of time. So, Ripley is alive because she was the star of the first three films so they need her to be in it or it will not be a true "Alien" film. That is what it felt like to me. My next biggest issue was with the new creature introduced in the movie. The three movies before it had clever ideas, even if they were mild. "Alien" introduced us to the species and the face-huggers, "Aliens" gave us the idea of a queen alien, and the third one had an alien but since it came out of a dog and not a human, it behaved a little like a dog would. What this film did was not even remotely clever. They had a half- human half-alien hybrid. This just screams to me that they wanted something new but could not think of something remotely clever so they did one of the most clich&eacute; things imaginable, mixing a human with the creature. Another problem I had was with the movie all together. It had nothing for the audience besides aliens hunting down and killing the humans. The characters were uninteresting--not that the characters from the first three films were works of art but they at least made you care--so we did not care if they succeeded or not as the only person we might be able to relate to is Ripley, but she's a clone and not the real Ripley so there is nothing from that. The film is played off more as aliens in "Poseidon" as the characters are escaping from a ship, going through different obstacles while aliens instead of rising water are following them. There is little tension as they could easily defeat the aliens. They have firepower and there is less than ten aliens. In "Alien" and "Alien 3", they had little to no weapons and in "Aliens" they had weapons but not enough to fight them all. There was tension with that. In this, the characters are all armed and there are few enough aliens that they could just fight them off, ergo, no tension. To try and compensate for this, they have one mercenary in a wheelchair and a guy with an embryo in him that is about to erupt from his chest, but both of these fail to bring tension to the audience. While I would watch "Alien: Resurrection" over other films I have seen, the film fails on multiple levels and takes the "Alien" franchise from having an ending that was pretty good to a lousy ending where we are left with our surviving characters sitting around with a "what happens now?" thought running through the audience's brains.

    An absolute Gorefest. Probably, an inevitable inclusion in the popular Franchise considering the Creature and where it had yet to go. Over the top and then some. Not a bad idea in the ongoing Saga of the "Thing from Another World". Fans are mixed on this with most leaning to the "forget this one and call it a trilogy" and many stick to that Mantra to this day. But lets take a look. Speaking of look, this is a slick, funk-punk, biker bash of slime and grime with a sheen of Violence that Fangoria types might appreciate. The beyond the pale goings-on that have a certain Pulpy charm is almost ruined by one Scene that is so gut-wrenching and ugly that, after viewing, the pit of your stomach may never be the same. Its the Window Vacuum Scene of course. But that God-Awful display aside, that dare it be said, truly sucks, this mostly can pass as a pretty good, very violent and horrific extension that, let's be honest, was certainly not going to end when there are cash registers to ring, to this day is still trying to expand.

    So what I do is to buy the entire Alien Quadrilogy, and sit down for a marathon. The first two were awesome, the third being alright, and then I look forward to seeing how they could continue after killing off Ripley. And with Alien Resurrection, they proved that the third movie should have been the last one. Not sure if anyone notices, but the crew following Ripley in each movie have a lot to say for the atmosphere. The original movie had a spaceship crew, then come the marines, and after that come a bunch of space convicts. Sorry, but I can't see the people in this movie as anything else than a bunch of retards. Some scenes I loathe: the scientist that uses steam to tame an Alien, scenes with that gun-guy ricocheting bullets via the walls and things (it's just not going to work), the way Ripley shows little fear of the Aliens anymore, and (good grief) the new Alien introduced at the end of the movie: Clone-Ripley's hybrid-humanoid-alien-beast-thing. Let's take a look at the last one. To me, he became an instant Jar Jar Binks of the Alien universe. My first thought was: "NO". When they kill it, it even looks at Ripley with sad eyes and desperately cries "Mommy!" Dear producers, think for a second: this thing had been alive for almost five minutes, and now it has learned English. Just the ending in itself kills everything with the Aliens: the danger, the sinister promise of certain death, and the pure genius characteristic design of HR Giger. Just sad. Please, no more Alien movies after this one. Some things can not be repaired.

    In an interview Ridley Scott cited the old Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant comics as one of many inspirations for Alien. Of all the films, the one that most resembles Heavy Metal is Jean-Pierre Jeunet's demented, over-the-top, but not unentertaining fourth entry. This is another entry that uh...alienated fans, and it certainly doesn't have any of the atmosphere or suspense of even Alien 3. Visually, it's quite uneven. Production design is impressive, effects not always so - even in 1997. Gore is ramped up to 11. Indeed we see far more blood and guts in this one than all the others put together. A number of critics had issues with the humour on display, but I personally found this refreshing. It was interesting to see a more lighthearted display in an Alien segment after the deadly seriousness of the first three. Where it most delivers is in Sigourney, excellent again, this time as a superhuman part-alien clone of Ripley, and in the frantic moments when the characters are facing off against the aliens. The monsters are menacing as always, and this time they're not above sacrificing one of their own for their own benefit. A brand new member to the Alien family, while perhaps not as scary as intended, provides some good moments at the climax. While suffering in comparison to it's predecessors, on it's own terms it makes for good, gruesome, comic-book-style mayhem.

    Alien is rightfully considered possibly the finest horror/sci-fi film of all time (The Thing and The Fly its' only real competitors, interestingly both remakes). Aliens is the best sci-fi/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered. Alien; Resurrection was a valiant attempt to put things right and my boy Joss Whedon does a commendable job. But he had a long way to climb after the debacle of Alien 3. Really Resurrection isn't a great film overall but it has some terrific things about it. Sigourney is great as always, Wionna does OK in her role, the relationship between Cal and Ripley 8 is brilliant and spawned a thousand slash fanfics. You can see the beginnings of Firefly here, even down to a prototype Jane and River. The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens. Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films). She and Cal gaze at the beauty of their world and Ripley observes that she's a stranger to Earth herself... Ripley has become the alien. I was actually only going to give this film a 7 but thinking of that final scene I've decided to give it 8.

    Thank god for the end. This film was almost as ugly as then third and no where near the first 2. This film brings back Ripley as a robot sort of thing since they wanted to have the alien in her so they made her and kept the alien and her alive. This film is as ugly and dark as the third one with a bad script to add on. The aliens have brains in this on as to escape their prison, they kill him he of their own, which the acid blood causes the floor to melt and burn and they escape. Then its downhill from there with bad fight scenes, lame horror, and revealing a new alien that is a little neat as it kills the mother alien and then takes Ripley in as its mother. The only scene I liked was the one that showed the room of all failed attempts cloning Ripley and seeing the only one that lived until Ripley burned it and the others. It was a end to a bad series which is not fair to say cause of the first 2, but the other 2 were just so bad.

    Prometheus was a wonderful surprise after the holidays this year; family went to Prometheus and none of us reviewed the title or content before going; when I saw Ridley Scott's name I was optimistic, then amazed and thrilled with the presentation as I have all the ALIEN movies memorized backwards and forwards; the family then wanted to know more about the ALIEN series; in 4 days we watched all the re-worked Alien movies, of the 4, I was most disappointed with Resurrection, I was hoping for extended character development in the same way Alien 3 was fixed; no doubt the the Alien 3 "assembly cut" benefited most from. I think Alien 4 could have also but like the French director said I think he already put out the best he could with what he had. I liked it a little more. The BLUE RAY pictures are great; not like Prometheus, but worth the time to pickup from your local library, pop it in, crank the sound and watch on a 60inch LCD. Alien 1, 2, 3 all benefit from BlueRay tech and presentation! ALIEN 2 , a.k.a. ALIENS will always be my favorite! Another GLORIOUS DAY IN THE CORPS!!!!

    When I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie,my first reaction was "Is this some kind of joke???".Well if it was a joke,it would have been in very poor taste,unfortunately it's not. I would like to point out,I was completely alright with how "Alien 3" ended and I liked the movie itself,sure it wasn't as good as the original and "Aliens",but for me it was a satisfying way to end the series."Alien:Resurrection" was completely unnecessary and the film itself seems more like a spoof than a sequel. First of all-the characters are flat.They are also inconsistent-One minuter Winona Ryder's character tries to give Ripley support and the next she literally says "F**k you" to Ripley.The black guy can do his fancy ricocheting bullets thingy,but he can't shoot a giant alien right in front of him.It seems the writers forgot what character development was until half-way into the film,where there is actually an attempt of giving the characters some depth,but then the writers said "F**k it,let's throw in some more aliens!Better yet,let's throw in a last minute explanation to create a new alien.Oh this is a good one,let's make the viewers sympathise for the damn thing,although they've seen it for less then 10 minutes."What were they thinking??? Another huge problem is the CGI-it sucks,but the director doesn't seem to agree,because there are so many pointless CGI scenes,but the movie was made in a period when Hollywood thought CGI was incredibly realistic and awesome.Some of the death scenes are creative,but really over-the- top and ridiculous.The suspense from the previous films is also missing. "Alien:Resurrection" is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen.Stay the hell away from it.

    Say what you will, this installment definitely saved the saga from the premature demise that was almost engineered by Sigourney Weaver when she indulged in way too much PMS hostility toward the series while making Alien3. The slaughter of all our darlings during the course of that film spelled desolation and oblivion for any hope of further sequels. But, lo and behold! Jeunet & company have done the impossible in a very houdinian escape from what looked like certain destruction with this film! I say HOORAH! Yes, it's very icky and slimy in its own way, but is that out of keeping with this tradition? Au contraire! This film also has its own original brand of beauty and elegance, perhaps more than any other installment thus far. Each installment makes its own special contribution: Alien=Atmosphere and suspense. Aliens=Action, adventure, and human interest. Resurrection=Visual effects and sheer creativity. Aliens3=Stupidity and forgettable-ness! The character development is wonderful. Ripley as Alien/human hybrid is a revelation of sinister anti-heroism. The dialog is snappy and often very funny. Ron Perlman is also wonderful as the hulking merc who is devoid of etiquette. I was so relieved when I saw this film! Once again, a great director adds his own genius to the anthology. But I still regret that David Fincher didn't get his fair shot at contributing with Alien3. If only Ms. Weaver had been in a less bitchy frame of mind back then (sigh!) Ah, well! As the French say, C'est la vie!

The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens. Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films). She and Cal gaze at the beauty of their world and Ripley observes that she's a stranger to Earth herself... Ripley has become the alien. I was actually only going to give this film a 7 but thinking of that final scene I've decided to give it 8.

    Thank god for the end. This film was almost as ugly as then third and no where near the first 2. This film brings back Ripley as a robot sort of thing since they wanted to have the alien in her so they made her and kept the alien and her alive. This film is as ugly and dark as the third one with a bad script to add on. The aliens have brains in this on as to escape their prison, they kill him he of their own, which the acid blood causes the floor to melt and burn and they escape. Then its downhill from there with bad fight scenes, lame horror, and revealing a new alien that is a little neat as it kills the mother alien and then takes Ripley in as its mother. The only scene I liked was the one that showed the room of all failed attempts cloning Ripley and seeing the only one that lived until Ripley burned it and the others. It was a end to a bad series which is not fair to say cause of the first 2, but the other 2 were just so bad.

    Prometheus was a wonderful surprise after the holidays this year; family went to Prometheus and none of us reviewed the title or content before going; when I saw Ridley Scott's name I was optimistic, then amazed and thrilled with the presentation as I have all the ALIEN movies memorized backwards and forwards; the family then wanted to know more about the ALIEN series; in 4 days we watched all the re-worked Alien movies, of the 4, I was most disappointed with Resurrection, I was hoping for extended character development in the same way Alien 3 was fixed; no doubt the the Alien 3 "assembly cut" benefited most from. I think Alien 4 could have also but like the French director said I think he already put out the best he could with what he had. I liked it a little more. The BLUE RAY pictures are great; not like Prometheus, but worth the time to pickup from your local library, pop it in, crank the sound and watch on a 60inch LCD. Alien 1, 2, 3 all benefit from BlueRay tech and presentation! ALIEN 2 , a.k.a. ALIENS will always be my favorite! Another GLORIOUS DAY IN THE CORPS!!!!

    When I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie,my first reaction was "Is this some kind of joke???".Well if it was a joke,it would have been in very poor taste,unfortunately it's not. I would like to point out,I was completely alright with how "Alien 3" ended and I liked the movie itself,sure it wasn't as good as the original and "Aliens",but for me it was a satisfying way to end the series."Alien:Resurrection" was completely unnecessary and the film itself seems more like a spoof than a sequel. First of all-the characters are flat.They are also inconsistent-One minuter Winona Ryder's character tries to give Ripley support and the next she literally says "F**k you" to Ripley.The black guy can do his fancy ricocheting bullets thingy,but he can't shoot a giant alien right in front of him.It seems the writers forgot what character development was until half-way into the film,where there is actually an attempt of giving the characters some depth,but then the writers said "F**k it,let's throw in some more aliens!Better yet,let's throw in a last minute explanation to create a new alien.Oh this is a good one,let's make the viewers sympathise for the damn thing,although they've seen it for less then 10 minutes."What were they thinking??? Another huge problem is the CGI-it sucks,but the director doesn't seem to agree,because there are so many pointless CGI scenes,but the movie was made in a period when Hollywood thought CGI was incredibly realistic and awesome.Some of the death scenes are creative,but really over-the- top and ridiculous.The suspense from the previous films is also missing. "Alien:Resurrection" is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen.Stay the hell away from it.

    Say what you will, this installment definitely saved the saga from the premature demise that was almost engineered by Sigourney Weaver when she indulged in way too much PMS hostility toward the series while making Alien3. The slaughter of all our darlings during the course of that film spelled desolation and oblivion for any hope of further sequels. But, lo and behold! Jeunet & company have done the impossible in a very houdinian escape from what looked like certain destruction with this film! I say HOORAH! Yes, it's very icky and slimy in its own way, but is that out of keeping with this tradition? Au contraire! This film also has its own original brand of beauty and elegance, perhaps more than any other installment thus far. Each installment makes its own special contribution: Alien=Atmosphere and suspense. Aliens=Action, adventure, and human interest. Resurrection=Visual effects and sheer creativity. Aliens3=Stupidity and forgettable-ness! The character development is wonderful. Ripley as Alien/human hybrid is a revelation of sinister anti-heroism. The dialog is snappy and often very funny. Ron Perlman is also wonderful as the hulking merc who is devoid of etiquette. I was so relieved when I saw this film! Once again, a great director adds his own genius to the anthology. But I still regret that David Fincher didn't get his fair shot at contributing with Alien3. If only Ms. Weaver had been in a less bitchy frame of mind back then (sigh!) Ah, well! As the French say, C'est la vie!
