 <sinopse>
  A young New York socialite becomes interested in a young man who has moved into her apartment building.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Struggling writer Paul Varjak moves into a New York apartment building and becomes intrigued by his pretty, quirky neighbor Holly Golightly. Holly's lifestyle confuses and fascinates Paul; in public she flits through parties with a sexy, sophisticated air, but when they're alone she changes into a sweetly vulnerable bundle of neuroses.

    I'm from China and I'm trying to improve my English by watching movies. I plan to watch one movie without scripts 5-7 times every week, and write a review about the movie. If you find any fault in grammar or vocabulary, please, please, please tell me. 2013/09/22 'Breakfst at Tiffany's', First Time. I watched the " Breakfast at Tiffany's" tonight. It's directed by Blake Edwards, and Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard starred in this movie. I can't understand most part of the movie, they was speaking too fast for me. It's a love story and it's romantic. My first impression of the movie is that " the girl is so chatty, and she needs a man to actually listen to her" It also reminds of some plots in Gossip Girl. It feels awesome to realize the connections between movies and TV show. and who is Freud? and their relationship? I hope I could figure out these questions by watching again. *Ok, It took me half an hour to figure out how to express " someone starred in a movie', and I don't have enough time to write the review today*

    It takes a long time for nothing to happen in this candy-coated bore. It's unfunny and charmless, overruns by about half an hour and drags along at the pace of a funeral procession. It's a typical Blake Edwards film, in other words. Young writer George Peppard, ditzy call girl Audrey Hepburn, blah blah parp yawn work the rest out for yourself. Hepburn is as luminous as always but her character is so one-note that her charm is wasted; meanwhile Peppard is blander than a rice cake. Gatecrashing the movie every so often is Mickey Rooney as their Japanese landlord, and if that bit of miscasting makes you cock your head, wait until you see his brutally unfunny and, if we're honest, utterly racist routine. I'm not sure what he or Edwards were thinking with this. Anyway, it's a banal and hopelessly dated movie in which nothing of any interest happens. In fact it all seems completely pointless.

    F*CK THIS MOVIE.I taught this was going to be about stealing jewelry from the tiffany whatever,and it isn't. It is about annoying snobby white people with their heads up their anuses. Specifically about some boring woman who can't shut the f*ck up,there is also this blonde guy(gigolo) who loves her,but she doesn't care for him because she only sucks rich peoples sausages. Stereotipoical Japanese guy who is played by a white guy(Mickey Rooney). THIS WAS THE MOST BORING TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE.DON'T WATCH THIS OVERRATED PILE OF STEAMING GARBAGE IF YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE.I wish I could go back in time to not see it.

    Everybody is familiar with the title Breakfast at Tiffany's, a timeless classic starring the beloved actress, Audrey Hepburn. While the story itself isn't particularly noteworthy, the charm that the actors bring makes the film well worth viewing. After all, the film is responsible for the iconic image of Audrey Hepburn arrayed in the famous black dress. The film represents the social aspects of the time, filled with smoking, drinking, and more smoking. Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) is in the middle of it all, using rich men to sustain her flamboyant lifestyle. Paul Varjak (George Peppard), the obvious love interest, sparks an attraction with Holly and attempts to save her from slowly destroying herself. The love story is pretty straightforward and lacks any sort of twists. However, the film has its moments (particularly the ending scene) and Cat (the ironically, nameless cat), that tie the story together with its recurring motif that people and things actually do and can belong to one another. Cat also provides some comic relief when scenes become a little too intense with emotions. Both Holly and Paul don't make for such interesting (or healthy) characters. One smokes and drinks all day, leading a frivolous life, while the other is poor and acts as a gigolo. Both characters are deeply troubled, but Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard do a great job at giving the characters some likability and allure. Even though Holly is childlike and unpractical, she is undeniably enjoyable to watch, similar to Leonardo DiCaprio's performance of Jay Gatsby. Upon watching Breakfast at Tiffany's, it's understandable how Audrey Hepburn was one of 20th century's most celebrated actresses.

    If it weren't for the ignorant, hateful caricature of a Japanese person played by Mickey Rooney, this would be a great movie. As it is, it manages to be a very good movie despite that problem. Holly Golightly is a woman with a cultivated sense of irresponsibility. She is not actually irresponsible; she's far too intelligent for that. She just acts the part so as to avoid potentially-painful entanglements. Her insistence that she neither depend upon nor be depended upon extends even to her relationship with the nameless cat who shares her apartment--I don't say "her" cat, because she would object to the possessive. Details like that make the character believable, and Audrey Hepburn's fine acting makes her likable. The fanciful New York lifestyle she lives is fun to experience vicariously.

    For a long time I've wanted to watch 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' but not before reading Truman Capote's novel. I've had the DVD lying around for months and when I finally got the book, I read it. Then after a month or so, I watched the film. If one can overlook the fact at how toned down the movie is (and I use the term tone down very loosely) compared to the much darker book, then as a stand alone it's quite entertaining and has earned classic status. Of course hardly anyone would have dared to make a movie as dark as the book itself. Going by the plusses the performances by the two leads George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn are delightful. Peppard's character in the book is quite different and I liked the change screenwriter George Axelrod made here by making the character more similar to Holly. The chemistry between the leads works superbly and of course Audrey Hepburn is the star of the film. A lesser actress could have easily messed this up but Hepburn effectively captures the layers of the complex Holly. Most of the rest of the cast do an adequate job. The cat impresses. I only scowled a little at Mickey Rooney's very stereotypical portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi. On the technical front, 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' scores high. The cinematography is wonderful, especially in the hilarious party sequence. Who could forget that scene? It's nice to see how New York City may have looked at that time. Lighting is mostly good. Mancini's score is fine. The story felt a little underdeveloped. At times, it felt as though it jumped from one sequence to another and the passage of time wasn't very clear. Blake Edwards's film is a fun classic but I would also like to see a real adaptation of the book.

    Not joking. Wasted my life with this movie. Hepburn's character is insufferable, Mickey Rooney plays a racist role. Plot points pop up and go nowhere. Painfully unfunny comedy stuffed into over dramatic pap. No characters are worth watching. Holly makes me cringe. I don't care about her or what happens to her. No emotional scenes ring true. Paul is stuck in the friend zone but still tries to get Holly to love him back. Holly is insane, and clearly emotionally crazy, yet Paul seems to be her pseudo-gay boyfriend. Film is drawn out, completely false, unfunny, and a waste of time. Any lovers of critical thinking, logic, film, or people worth your time should run the other way and never look back.

    The reason I love this movie so much is because it captures the irresponsibility and spontaneity of youth in a sophisticated way. It reminds me of my first time entering the big city, the feeling of liberation and anonymity. There just seemed to be so many options, and being carefree was part of learning about everything. My favourite scene is when she has to rescue the cat and she realises something about the realities of life. It also makes one realise, looking in retrospect, that even an incredible star like Hepburn ages and dies. That each of us is equal in that sense and although, youth is a mask,it's still full of wonderful memories... This movie represents that in a metaphor. Highly recommended.

    i saw this movie with some friends at a theater that was having a "chick flick day". i came to this movie with no prior knowledge of what it was supposed to be about. i sat their for the entire duration of the movie and still had no knowledge as to what it was about. there was no plot to this movie, and i have to idea why it has just good ratings. from what i watched this is just a whiny girl who is trying to get herself together and it takes the whole movie to do it. i guess to summarize, i walked away from this movie not entertained and confused. usually, a movie will convey a message by the time its over, but if this one had one... i have no idea what it was supposed to be.

    My opinion is that this film has not stood the test of time. Yes, the plot is logical, the characters are logical in what they do (even if what they do is illogical) and the acting is solid. The locations are fitting and all this creates a very sweet and romantic movie. It's just that newer movies have copied or processed further the events of this one so many times that they are no longer unique. I'm young compared to the age of this movie, but I get the feeling that the events that transpire in the movie caused a lot of conversation back when it was released. Stereotypes and generally quite irresponsible life is portrayed, but unfortunately those things are the norm nowadays. I gave the movie 7, If you like romantic drama with a bit of comedy you can easily give this movie a 9.

    Everybody is familiar with the title Breakfast at Tiffany's, a timeless classic starring the beloved actress, Audrey Hepburn. While the story itself isn't particularly noteworthy, the charm that the actors bring makes the film well worth viewing. After all, the film is responsible for the iconic image of Audrey Hepburn arrayed in the famous black dress. The film represents the social aspects of the time, filled with smoking, drinking, and more smoking. Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) is in the middle of it all, using rich men to sustain her flamboyant lifestyle. Paul Varjak (George Peppard), the obvious love interest, sparks an attraction with Holly and attempts to save her from slowly destroying herself. The love story is pretty straightforward and lacks any sort of twists. However, the film has its moments (particularly the ending scene) and Cat (the ironically, nameless cat), that tie the story together with its recurring motif that people and things actually do and can belong to one another. Cat also provides some comic relief when scenes become a little too intense with emotions. Both Holly and Paul don't make for such interesting (or healthy) characters. One smokes and drinks all day, leading a frivolous life, while the other is poor and acts as a gigolo. Both characters are deeply troubled, but Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard do a great job at giving the characters some likability and allure. Even though Holly is childlike and unpractical, she is undeniably enjoyable to watch, similar to Leonardo DiCaprio's performance of Jay Gatsby. Upon watching Breakfast at Tiffany's, it's understandable how Audrey Hepburn was one of 20th century's most celebrated actresses.

    If it weren't for the ignorant, hateful caricature of a Japanese person played by Mickey Rooney, this would be a great movie. As it is, it manages to be a very good movie despite that problem. Holly Golightly is a woman with a cultivated sense of irresponsibility. She is not actually irresponsible; she's far too intelligent for that. She just acts the part so as to avoid potentially-painful entanglements. Her insistence that she neither depend upon nor be depended upon extends even to her relationship with the nameless cat who shares her apartment--I don't say "her" cat, because she would object to the possessive. Details like that make the character believable, and Audrey Hepburn's fine acting makes her likable. The fanciful New York lifestyle she lives is fun to experience vicariously.

    For a long time I've wanted to watch 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' but not before reading Truman Capote's novel. I've had the DVD lying around for months and when I finally got the book, I read it. Then after a month or so, I watched the film. If one can overlook the fact at how toned down the movie is (and I use the term tone down very loosely) compared to the much darker book, then as a stand alone it's quite entertaining and has earned classic status. Of course hardly anyone would have dared to make a movie as dark as the book itself. Going by the plusses the performances by the two leads George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn are delightful. Peppard's character in the book is quite different and I liked the change screenwriter George Axelrod made here by making the character more similar to Holly. The chemistry between the leads works superbly and of course Audrey Hepburn is the star of the film. A lesser actress could have easily messed this up but Hepburn effectively captures the layers of the complex Holly. Most of the rest of the cast do an adequate job. The cat impresses. I only scowled a little at Mickey Rooney's very stereotypical portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi. On the technical front, 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' scores high. The cinematography is wonderful, especially in the hilarious party sequence. Who could forget that scene? It's nice to see how New York City may have looked at that time. Lighting is mostly good. Mancini's score is fine. The story felt a little underdeveloped. At times, it felt as though it jumped from one sequence to another and the passage of time wasn't very clear. Blake Edwards's film is a fun classic but I would also like to see a real adaptation of the book.

    Not joking. Wasted my life with this movie. Hepburn's character is insufferable, Mickey Rooney plays a racist role. Plot points pop up and go nowhere. Painfully unfunny comedy stuffed into over dramatic pap. No characters are worth watching. Holly makes me cringe. I don't care about her or what happens to her. No emotional scenes ring true. Paul is stuck in the friend zone but still tries to get Holly to love him back. Holly is insane, and clearly emotionally crazy, yet Paul seems to be her pseudo-gay boyfriend. Film is drawn out, completely false, unfunny, and a waste of time. Any lovers of critical thinking, logic, film, or people worth your time should run the other way and never look back.

    The reason I love this movie so much is because it captures the irresponsibility and spontaneity of youth in a sophisticated way. It reminds me of my first time entering the big city, the feeling of liberation and anonymity. There just seemed to be so many options, and being carefree was part of learning about everything. My favourite scene is when she has to rescue the cat and she realises something about the realities of life. It also makes one realise, looking in retrospect, that even an incredible star like Hepburn ages and dies. That each of us is equal in that sense and although, youth is a mask,it's still full of wonderful memories... This movie represents that in a metaphor. Highly recommended.

    i saw this movie with some friends at a theater that was having a "chick flick day". i came to this movie with no prior knowledge of what it was supposed to be about. i sat their for the entire duration of the movie and still had no knowledge as to what it was about. there was no plot to this movie, and i have to idea why it has just good ratings. from what i watched this is just a whiny girl who is trying to get herself together and it takes the whole movie to do it. i guess to summarize, i walked away from this movie not entertained and confused. usually, a movie will convey a message by the time its over, but if this one had one... i have no idea what it was supposed to be.

    My opinion is that this film has not stood the test of time. Yes, the plot is logical, the characters are logical in what they do (even if what they do is illogical) and the acting is solid. The locations are fitting and all this creates a very sweet and romantic movie. It's just that newer movies have copied or processed further the events of this one so many times that they are no longer unique. I'm young compared to the age of this movie, but I get the feeling that the events that transpire in the movie caused a lot of conversation back when it was released. Stereotypes and generally quite irresponsible life is portrayed, but unfortunately those things are the norm nowadays. I gave the movie 7, If you like romantic drama with a bit of comedy you can easily give this movie a 9.

    I'm from China and I'm trying to improve my English by watching movies. I plan to watch one movie without scripts 5-7 times every week, and write a review about the movie. If you find any fault in grammar or vocabulary, please, please, please tell me. 2013/09/22 'Breakfst at Tiffany's', First Time. I watched the " Breakfast at Tiffany's" tonight. It's directed by Blake Edwards, and Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard starred in this movie. I can't understand most part of the movie, they was speaking too fast for me. It's a love story and it's romantic. My first impression of the movie is that " the girl is so chatty, and she needs a man to actually listen to her" It also reminds of some plots in Gossip Girl. It feels awesome to realize the connections between movies and TV show. and who is Freud? and their relationship? I hope I could figure out these questions by watching again. *Ok, It took me half an hour to figure out how to express " someone starred in a movie', and I don't have enough time to write the review today*

    It takes a long time for nothing to happen in this candy-coated bore. It's unfunny and charmless, overruns by about half an hour and drags along at the pace of a funeral procession. It's a typical Blake Edwards film, in other words. Young writer George Peppard, ditzy call girl Audrey Hepburn, blah blah parp yawn work the rest out for yourself. Hepburn is as luminous as always but her character is so one-note that her charm is wasted; meanwhile Peppard is blander than a rice cake. Gatecrashing the movie every so often is Mickey Rooney as their Japanese landlord, and if that bit of miscasting makes you cock your head, wait until you see his brutally unfunny and, if we're honest, utterly racist routine. I'm not sure what he or Edwards were thinking with this. Anyway, it's a banal and hopelessly dated movie in which nothing of any interest happens. In fact it all seems completely pointless.

    F*CK THIS MOVIE.I taught this was going to be about stealing jewelry from the tiffany whatever,and it isn't. It is about annoying snobby white people with their heads up their anuses. Specifically about some boring woman who can't shut the f*ck up,there is also this blonde guy(gigolo) who loves her,but she doesn't care for him because she only sucks rich peoples sausages. Stereotipoical Japanese guy who is played by a white guy(Mickey Rooney). THIS WAS THE MOST BORING TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE.DON'T WATCH THIS OVERRATED PILE OF STEAMING GARBAGE IF YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE.I wish I could go back in time to not see it.

    The reason I love this movie so much is because it captures the irresponsibility and spontaneity of youth in a sophisticated way. It reminds me of my first time entering the big city, the feeling of liberation and anonymity. There just seemed to be so many options, and being carefree was part of learning about everything. My favourite scene is when she has to rescue the cat and she realises something about the realities of life. It also makes one realise, looking in retrospect, that even an incredible star like Hepburn ages and dies. That each of us is equal in that sense and although, youth is a mask,it's still full of wonderful memories... This movie represents that in a metaphor. Highly recommended.

    i saw this movie with some friends at a theater that was having a "chick flick day". i came to this movie with no prior knowledge of what it was supposed to be about. i sat their for the entire duration of the movie and still had no knowledge as to what it was about. there was no plot to this movie, and i have to idea why it has just good ratings. from what i watched this is just a whiny girl who is trying to get herself together and it takes the whole movie to do it. i guess to summarize, i walked away from this movie not entertained and confused. usually, a movie will convey a message by the time its over, but if this one had one... i have no idea what it was supposed to be.

    My opinion is that this film has not stood the test of time. Yes, the plot is logical, the characters are logical in what they do (even if what they do is illogical) and the acting is solid. The locations are fitting and all this creates a very sweet and romantic movie. It's just that newer movies have copied or processed further the events of this one so many times that they are no longer unique. I'm young compared to the age of this movie, but I get the feeling that the events that transpire in the movie caused a lot of conversation back when it was released. Stereotypes and generally quite irresponsible life is portrayed, but unfortunately those things are the norm nowadays. I gave the movie 7, If you like romantic drama with a bit of comedy you can easily give this movie a 9.

    I'm from China and I'm trying to improve my English by watching movies. I plan to watch one movie without scripts 5-7 times every week, and write a review about the movie. If you find any fault in grammar or vocabulary, please, please, please tell me. 2013/09/22 'Breakfst at Tiffany's', First Time. I watched the " Breakfast at Tiffany's" tonight. It's directed by Blake Edwards, and Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard starred in this movie. I can't understand most part of the movie, they was speaking too fast for me. It's a love story and it's romantic. My first impression of the movie is that " the girl is so chatty, and she needs a man to actually listen to her" It also reminds of some plots in Gossip Girl. It feels awesome to realize the connections between movies and TV show. and who is Freud? and their relationship? I hope I could figure out these questions by watching again. *Ok, It took me half an hour to figure out how to express " someone starred in a movie', and I don't have enough time to write the review today*

    It takes a long time for nothing to happen in this candy-coated bore. It's unfunny and charmless, overruns by about half an hour and drags along at the pace of a funeral procession. It's a typical Blake Edwards film, in other words. Young writer George Peppard, ditzy call girl Audrey Hepburn, blah blah parp yawn work the rest out for yourself. Hepburn is as luminous as always but her character is so one-note that her charm is wasted; meanwhile Peppard is blander than a rice cake. Gatecrashing the movie every so often is Mickey Rooney as their Japanese landlord, and if that bit of miscasting makes you cock your head, wait until you see his brutally unfunny and, if we're honest, utterly racist routine. I'm not sure what he or Edwards were thinking with this. Anyway, it's a banal and hopelessly dated movie in which nothing of any interest happens. In fact it all seems completely pointless.

    F*CK THIS MOVIE.I taught this was going to be about stealing jewelry from the tiffany whatever,and it isn't. It is about annoying snobby white people with their heads up their anuses. Specifically about some boring woman who can't shut the f*ck up,there is also this blonde guy(gigolo) who loves her,but she doesn't care for him because she only sucks rich peoples sausages. Stereotipoical Japanese guy who is played by a white guy(Mickey Rooney). THIS WAS THE MOST BORING TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE.DON'T WATCH THIS OVERRATED PILE OF STEAMING GARBAGE IF YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE.I wish I could go back in time to not see it.

    Everybody is familiar with the title Breakfast at Tiffany's, a timeless classic starring the beloved actress, Audrey Hepburn. While the story itself isn't particularly noteworthy, the charm that the actors bring makes the film well worth viewing. After all, the film is responsible for the iconic image of Audrey Hepburn arrayed in the famous black dress. The film represents the social aspects of the time, filled with smoking, drinking, and more smoking. Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) is in the middle of it all, using rich men to sustain her flamboyant lifestyle. Paul Varjak (George Peppard), the obvious love interest, sparks an attraction with Holly and attempts to save her from slowly destroying herself. The love story is pretty straightforward and lacks any sort of twists. However, the film has its moments (particularly the ending scene) and Cat (the ironically, nameless cat), that tie the story together with its recurring motif that people and things actually do and can belong to one another. Cat also provides some comic relief when scenes become a little too intense with emotions. Both Holly and Paul don't make for such interesting (or healthy) characters. One smokes and drinks all day, leading a frivolous life, while the other is poor and acts as a gigolo. Both characters are deeply troubled, but Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard do a great job at giving the characters some likability and allure. Even though Holly is childlike and unpractical, she is undeniably enjoyable to watch, similar to Leonardo DiCaprio's performance of Jay Gatsby. Upon watching Breakfast at Tiffany's, it's understandable how Audrey Hepburn was one of 20th century's most celebrated actresses.

    If it weren't for the ignorant, hateful caricature of a Japanese person played by Mickey Rooney, this would be a great movie. As it is, it manages to be a very good movie despite that problem. Holly Golightly is a woman with a cultivated sense of irresponsibility. She is not actually irresponsible; she's far too intelligent for that. She just acts the part so as to avoid potentially-painful entanglements. Her insistence that she neither depend upon nor be depended upon extends even to her relationship with the nameless cat who shares her apartment--I don't say "her" cat, because she would object to the possessive. Details like that make the character believable, and Audrey Hepburn's fine acting makes her likable. The fanciful New York lifestyle she lives is fun to experience vicariously.

    For a long time I've wanted to watch 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' but not before reading Truman Capote's novel. I've had the DVD lying around for months and when I finally got the book, I read it. Then after a month or so, I watched the film. If one can overlook the fact at how toned down the movie is (and I use the term tone down very loosely) compared to the much darker book, then as a stand alone it's quite entertaining and has earned classic status. Of course hardly anyone would have dared to make a movie as dark as the book itself. Going by the plusses the performances by the two leads George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn are delightful. Peppard's character in the book is quite different and I liked the change screenwriter George Axelrod made here by making the character more similar to Holly. The chemistry between the leads works superbly and of course Audrey Hepburn is the star of the film. A lesser actress could have easily messed this up but Hepburn effectively captures the layers of the complex Holly. Most of the rest of the cast do an adequate job. The cat impresses. I only scowled a little at Mickey Rooney's very stereotypical portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi. On the technical front, 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' scores high. The cinematography is wonderful, especially in the hilarious party sequence. Who could forget that scene? It's nice to see how New York City may have looked at that time. Lighting is mostly good. Mancini's score is fine. The story felt a little underdeveloped. At times, it felt as though it jumped from one sequence to another and the passage of time wasn't very clear. Blake Edwards's film is a fun classic but I would also like to see a real adaptation of the book.

    Not joking. Wasted my life with this movie. Hepburn's character is insufferable, Mickey Rooney plays a racist role. Plot points pop up and go nowhere. Painfully unfunny comedy stuffed into over dramatic pap. No characters are worth watching. Holly makes me cringe. I don't care about her or what happens to her. No emotional scenes ring true. Paul is stuck in the friend zone but still tries to get Holly to love him back. Holly is insane, and clearly emotionally crazy, yet Paul seems to be her pseudo-gay boyfriend. Film is drawn out, completely false, unfunny, and a waste of time. Any lovers of critical thinking, logic, film, or people worth your time should run the other way and never look back.

    F*CK THIS MOVIE.I taught this was going to be about stealing jewelry from the tiffany whatever,and it isn't. It is about annoying snobby white people with their heads up their anuses. Specifically about some boring woman who can't shut the f*ck up,there is also this blonde guy(gigolo) who loves her,but she doesn't care for him because she only sucks rich peoples sausages. Stereotipoical Japanese guy who is played by a white guy(Mickey Rooney). THIS WAS THE MOST BORING TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE.DON'T WATCH THIS OVERRATED PILE OF STEAMING GARBAGE IF YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE.I wish I could go back in time to not see it.

    Everybody is familiar with the title Breakfast at Tiffany's, a timeless classic starring the beloved actress, Audrey Hepburn. While the story itself isn't particularly noteworthy, the charm that the actors bring makes the film well worth viewing. After all, the film is responsible for the iconic image of Audrey Hepburn arrayed in the famous black dress. The film represents the social aspects of the time, filled with smoking, drinking, and more smoking. Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) is in the middle of it all, using rich men to sustain her flamboyant lifestyle. Paul Varjak (George Peppard), the obvious love interest, sparks an attraction with Holly and attempts to save her from slowly destroying herself. The love story is pretty straightforward and lacks any sort of twists. However, the film has its moments (particularly the ending scene) and Cat (the ironically, nameless cat), that tie the story together with its recurring motif that people and things actually do and can belong to one another. Cat also provides some comic relief when scenes become a little too intense with emotions. Both Holly and Paul don't make for such interesting (or healthy) characters. One smokes and drinks all day, leading a frivolous life, while the other is poor and acts as a gigolo. Both characters are deeply troubled, but Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard do a great job at giving the characters some likability and allure. Even though Holly is childlike and unpractical, she is undeniably enjoyable to watch, similar to Leonardo DiCaprio's performance of Jay Gatsby. Upon watching Breakfast at Tiffany's, it's understandable how Audrey Hepburn was one of 20th century's most celebrated actresses.

    If it weren't for the ignorant, hateful caricature of a Japanese person played by Mickey Rooney, this would be a great movie. As it is, it manages to be a very good movie despite that problem. Holly Golightly is a woman with a cultivated sense of irresponsibility. She is not actually irresponsible; she's far too intelligent for that. She just acts the part so as to avoid potentially-painful entanglements. Her insistence that she neither depend upon nor be depended upon extends even to her relationship with the nameless cat who shares her apartment--I don't say "her" cat, because she would object to the possessive. Details like that make the character believable, and Audrey Hepburn's fine acting makes her likable. The fanciful New York lifestyle she lives is fun to experience vicariously.

    For a long time I've wanted to watch 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' but not before reading Truman Capote's novel. I've had the DVD lying around for months and when I finally got the book, I read it. Then after a month or so, I watched the film. If one can overlook the fact at how toned down the movie is (and I use the term tone down very loosely) compared to the much darker book, then as a stand alone it's quite entertaining and has earned classic status. Of course hardly anyone would have dared to make a movie as dark as the book itself. Going by the plusses the performances by the two leads George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn are delightful. Peppard's character in the book is quite different and I liked the change screenwriter George Axelrod made here by making the character more similar to Holly. The chemistry between the leads works superbly and of course Audrey Hepburn is the star of the film. A lesser actress could have easily messed this up but Hepburn effectively captures the layers of the complex Holly. Most of the rest of the cast do an adequate job. The cat impresses. I only scowled a little at Mickey Rooney's very stereotypical portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi. On the technical front, 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' scores high. The cinematography is wonderful, especially in the hilarious party sequence. Who could forget that scene? It's nice to see how New York City may have looked at that time. Lighting is mostly good. Mancini's score is fine. The story felt a little underdeveloped. At times, it felt as though it jumped from one sequence to another and the passage of time wasn't very clear. Blake Edwards's film is a fun classic but I would also like to see a real adaptation of the book.

    Not joking. Wasted my life with this movie. Hepburn's character is insufferable, Mickey Rooney plays a racist role. Plot points pop up and go nowhere. Painfully unfunny comedy stuffed into over dramatic pap. No characters are worth watching. Holly makes me cringe. I don't care about her or what happens to her. No emotional scenes ring true. Paul is stuck in the friend zone but still tries to get Holly to love him back. Holly is insane, and clearly emotionally crazy, yet Paul seems to be her pseudo-gay boyfriend. Film is drawn out, completely false, unfunny, and a waste of time. Any lovers of critical thinking, logic, film, or people worth your time should run the other way and never look back.

    The reason I love this movie so much is because it captures the irresponsibility and spontaneity of youth in a sophisticated way. It reminds me of my first time entering the big city, the feeling of liberation and anonymity. There just seemed to be so many options, and being carefree was part of learning about everything. My favourite scene is when she has to rescue the cat and she realises something about the realities of life. It also makes one realise, looking in retrospect, that even an incredible star like Hepburn ages and dies. That each of us is equal in that sense and although, youth is a mask,it's still full of wonderful memories... This movie represents that in a metaphor. Highly recommended.

    i saw this movie with some friends at a theater that was having a "chick flick day". i came to this movie with no prior knowledge of what it was supposed to be about. i sat their for the entire duration of the movie and still had no knowledge as to what it was about. there was no plot to this movie, and i have to idea why it has just good ratings. from what i watched this is just a whiny girl who is trying to get herself together and it takes the whole movie to do it. i guess to summarize, i walked away from this movie not entertained and confused. usually, a movie will convey a message by the time its over, but if this one had one... i have no idea what it was supposed to be.

    My opinion is that this film has not stood the test of time. Yes, the plot is logical, the characters are logical in what they do (even if what they do is illogical) and the acting is solid. The locations are fitting and all this creates a very sweet and romantic movie. It's just that newer movies have copied or processed further the events of this one so many times that they are no longer unique. I'm young compared to the age of this movie, but I get the feeling that the events that transpire in the movie caused a lot of conversation back when it was released. Stereotypes and generally quite irresponsible life is portrayed, but unfortunately those things are the norm nowadays. I gave the movie 7, If you like romantic drama with a bit of comedy you can easily give this movie a 9.

    I'm from China and I'm trying to improve my English by watching movies. I plan to watch one movie without scripts 5-7 times every week, and write a review about the movie. If you find any fault in grammar or vocabulary, please, please, please tell me. 2013/09/22 'Breakfst at Tiffany's', First Time. I watched the " Breakfast at Tiffany's" tonight. It's directed by Blake Edwards, and Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard starred in this movie. I can't understand most part of the movie, they was speaking too fast for me. It's a love story and it's romantic. My first impression of the movie is that " the girl is so chatty, and she needs a man to actually listen to her" It also reminds of some plots in Gossip Girl. It feels awesome to realize the connections between movies and TV show. and who is Freud? and their relationship? I hope I could figure out these questions by watching again. *Ok, It took me half an hour to figure out how to express " someone starred in a movie', and I don't have enough time to write the review today*

    It takes a long time for nothing to happen in this candy-coated bore. It's unfunny and charmless, overruns by about half an hour and drags along at the pace of a funeral procession. It's a typical Blake Edwards film, in other words. Young writer George Peppard, ditzy call girl Audrey Hepburn, blah blah parp yawn work the rest out for yourself. Hepburn is as luminous as always but her character is so one-note that her charm is wasted; meanwhile Peppard is blander than a rice cake. Gatecrashing the movie every so often is Mickey Rooney as their Japanese landlord, and if that bit of miscasting makes you cock your head, wait until you see his brutally unfunny and, if we're honest, utterly racist routine. I'm not sure what he or Edwards were thinking with this. Anyway, it's a banal and hopelessly dated movie in which nothing of any interest happens. In fact it all seems completely pointless.

    Not joking. Wasted my life with this movie. Hepburn's character is insufferable, Mickey Rooney plays a racist role. Plot points pop up and go nowhere. Painfully unfunny comedy stuffed into over dramatic pap. No characters are worth watching. Holly makes me cringe. I don't care about her or what happens to her. No emotional scenes ring true. Paul is stuck in the friend zone but still tries to get Holly to love him back. Holly is insane, and clearly emotionally crazy, yet Paul seems to be her pseudo-gay boyfriend. Film is drawn out, completely false, unfunny, and a waste of time. Any lovers of critical thinking, logic, film, or people worth your time should run the other way and never look back.

    The reason I love this movie so much is because it captures the irresponsibility and spontaneity of youth in a sophisticated way. It reminds me of my first time entering the big city, the feeling of liberation and anonymity. There just seemed to be so many options, and being carefree was part of learning about everything. My favourite scene is when she has to rescue the cat and she realises something about the realities of life. It also makes one realise, looking in retrospect, that even an incredible star like Hepburn ages and dies. That each of us is equal in that sense and although, youth is a mask,it's still full of wonderful memories... This movie represents that in a metaphor. Highly recommended.

    i saw this movie with some friends at a theater that was having a "chick flick day". i came to this movie with no prior knowledge of what it was supposed to be about. i sat their for the entire duration of the movie and still had no knowledge as to what it was about. there was no plot to this movie, and i have to idea why it has just good ratings. from what i watched this is just a whiny girl who is trying to get herself together and it takes the whole movie to do it. i guess to summarize, i walked away from this movie not entertained and confused. usually, a movie will convey a message by the time its over, but if this one had one... i have no idea what it was supposed to be.

    My opinion is that this film has not stood the test of time. Yes, the plot is logical, the characters are logical in what they do (even if what they do is illogical) and the acting is solid. The locations are fitting and all this creates a very sweet and romantic movie. It's just that newer movies have copied or processed further the events of this one so many times that they are no longer unique. I'm young compared to the age of this movie, but I get the feeling that the events that transpire in the movie caused a lot of conversation back when it was released. Stereotypes and generally quite irresponsible life is portrayed, but unfortunately those things are the norm nowadays. I gave the movie 7, If you like romantic drama with a bit of comedy you can easily give this movie a 9.
