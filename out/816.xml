    Some people just never learn from history. They believe that what happened to others won't be their fate as well. This is what often happens in Horror movie sequels. Some believe the stories and leave well enough alone. Others tell them it's just their imagination. The characters in 'Candyman' messed with something they didn't believe in. It was inevitable that someone else would make the same mistake. Pros: Well acted. Solid directing job. Powerful opening sequence. Though mostly a repeat, Phillip Glass's score is still effective. Atmospheric cinematography. Some quite good effects. A few really chilling sequences. Moves at a nice pace. Cons: Relies too much on false scares. Reveals perhaps too much about the monster's origins. Repeats many plot devices from the original. Final thoughts: The original 'Candyman' was surely a tough act to follow. As a sequel, and on it's own, 'Farewell to the Flesh' works pretty well. So many sequels to Horror films lack the heart of their predecessors. The makers of this one obviously wanted to give us a worthy continuation of the story. For the most part, it's a success. Too bad it didn't end here though. My rating: 3.5/5

    I was not a big fan of Candyman (1992) as I did not find the movie scary or creepy at all and Candyman did not scare me at all. I saw this movie last weekends, I Can not think of single think that really stood out in the movie, i can't remember much about the movie at all. I found this movie really boring at times but I did find less boring then first movie, i don't why, i the felt candyman was just little bit more creepy this time around. The acting was good from the whole cast but the ending was little rushed I think however it fitted in with rest of the movie. I gave first Candyman 5 out of 10 and the same goes for this movie.

    A good Philip Glass score  albeit one that's rehashed from the original  is the only good thing about this lacklustre sequel that's more like an endless slasher flick than the evocative and atmospheric ghost story of the first film. Here, Candyman is given a back story (and the flashbacks are the only effective part of the production) while going after various characters who may or may not be his own descendants. This is a lifeless and vapid film, one that it's genuinely difficult to watch while keeping your eyes open. Every signposted death is familiar from the original, and no extra lashings of grue are going to change that. The story delivers an uninspiring lead actress (Kelly Rowan) and gives her an equally uninteresting brother (William O'Leary), neither of whom do much to elicit sympathy in the viewer. Tony Todd, of course, is exceptional, but it takes more than a single actor to make a great film. Bill Condon later won plaudits with GODS AND MONSTERS but I found his direction here to be stultifying  and dated in the worst, mid-1990s way. Aside from those aforementioned flashbacks, I can't think of a single moment of life or energy in the entire plot. It's merely uninspired, with Candyman whittling off one character after the other, while way too much time is given to one of those awfully clich&eacute;d sub-plots about the police suspecting an entirely innocent victim of the killings. Throwing in some 'name' character actors like Veronica Cartwright and Bill Nunn doesn't soften the experience, either.

    The only way I can think of that anyone would prefer this to the original is, as much as I hate to use that clich&eacute;, that they did not understand it. There is infinitely more to that brilliant film than "black dude kills people with hook". However, if that was what you liked about it, heck, you might enjoy this. Bigger, not better. The first carefully built up, this goes through the motions. This begins with a dull retelling of the myth(which, as you may remember, took time to get to last time around... and no, that wasn't an accident), and then, perplexingly, proceeds to go over it again(and showing flashbacks to what we already know happened... does a different way of saying the exact same thing count as creativity now?). This spells out what the first hinted at so expertly. Is it really such a tough concept? If we are not told a lot, we will fill in the blanks, and what we imagine will be lightyears past what can be put on a screen. I love this medium, but you can't possibly think that one set idea is superior to each individual viewer's imagination. This tries to explain things that ought to remain unclear, and the effort is boring. Todd gets increased screen-time(and is given lofty-sounding BS to spew, half of it doesn't make a lick of sense... and yes, of course he can deliver it impeccably), and as you probably already know, the man can not look bad regardless of how he is presented. Still, it isn't satisfying. We become used to it, obviously. This awkwardly forces in kills by him, in spite of the strict rules related to that. The continuity is screwed over repeatedly, unless you consider this to be an alternative to the '92 one(it needed no sequels, it was *perfectly* self-contained). This is utterly predictable, it is no longer clever or layered, and the script increases in stupidity at an exponential rate as it progresses, until it spins out of control and then blissfully ends, on what you know is a low note. They didn't even bother to experiment, this uses the same score, and a ton of other things that worked in the film preceding this, without nearing it in atmosphere at all. The plot exists solely to provide a follow-up. A slasher? Arguably, though this is lousy regardless. This has boo-scares that don't pay off by the truckload. The FX are poor(and not necessarily convincing), including the make-up. Acting is decent at best(the kids are *atrocious*). I also personally couldn't stand Kingfish, absolutely painful, and he just would not shut up. What is memorable about this? Name me one thing that is remotely interesting in this, that was introduced in this. There is a lot of disturbing content, bloody(at times gory) violence, a little strong language and sexuality, and brief female nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this purely to those looking for bland horror that delivers what you'd expect and *nothing* else. 5/10

    i liked this follow up to the original Candyman movie.i found it entertaining and the acting is pretty good.i also liked that there was a back story that fleshed out the title character and gave him some humanity.i didn't find the movie scary and there wasn't a lot of gore,so gore hounds will be disappointed.the story itself doesn't have a lot of depth to it,other than the back story.still the movie goes along at a good clip,and it's very stylish,more so than the first one was.was it as good as the original?i think so.i don't think it was better,but it was as good.in terms of entertainment,i thought it was a good movie.if you expect to be scared,you might be disappointed here.otherwise,you might like it.for me,Candyman 2:Farewell to the Flesh is an 8/10

    This was a movie that didn't really need to have been made. The first Candyman did just about everything with the concept that needed to be done whilst keeping the character himself full of mystery and menace. The relationship between the Candyman and Helen was wonderfully drawn, and any sequel would have an insurmountable example to follow. This said, I dug Candyman 2: Farewell to the Flesh quite a bit. Kelly Rowan makes for an appealing heroine, she can act, she's pretty and it's funny to see her pre The OC. Tony Todd is fearsome as ever, although the dialogue isn't up to the standards of the first. The music is pretty much the same I believe, maybe with slight alterations, and it works. Director Bill Condon keeps the film tightly paced and watchable and has a nice sense of atmosphere, although the film doesn't really deliver scares. The handful of kill scenes are nicely bloody and vicious, but the scenes are more efficient than scary. They are fun, and a strong point of the movie, but they just don't have the impact you expect from the Candyman. The strong story and acting are the best thing about this, keeping the film constantly watchable and fun and developing the character of Daniel Robitalle in interesting ways. All considered, I say this is a decent film with a number of cool moments, definitely worthwhile for the horror fans although its best to forget the majestic original before watching.

    Dreary sequel, despite resetting the narrative to the tale's original location of New Orleans (with flashbacks to the Candyman's grisly fate). This time around, the heroine discovers she's related to the Candyman rather than being a re-incarnation of his white lover; that said, Kelly Rowan is no substitute for Viriginia Madsen! In fact, apart from Tony Todd's titular character (who's even less scary here but, at least, he's intelligible), Michael Culkin's ill-fated professor is the only link to the first film. Other than the requisite gore (and Philip Glass score), again, we have a subplot involving a black child who lives in fear of the Candyman; additionally, however, we get a bit of irrelevant sleaze (this being conveniently set during Mardi Gras)! The presence of veterans Veronica Cartwright and Matt Clark is welcome; predictably, though, they both end up as meat for the Candyman's hook. While director Condon may have started in horror (this is the only one I've watched, actually), he really came into his own when he branched out into other genres  and, quite frankly, I wouldn't have bothered watching this hadn't he been involved...

    I must say I was rather entertained by this ill-received sequel to the original horror hit. I do admit that the film's explanation regarding the origin of Daniel Robitaille's power seemed rather silly(the idea that Candyman's soul was trapped in the mirror of his white lover Caroline due to the extremities of his torment, hate & agony for what the racist white township did to him), but the film has so many things I enjoyed that I was actually able to look past it. Annie(Kelly Rowan, many who watched THE OC might recognize her)is a schoolteacher in New Orleans whose father died at the hook of the Candyman. Her brother, Ethan(William O'Leary), is in jail for the possible murder of a novelist(he wrote a novel about Candyman, was asked by Ethan's father for help), who we see at the opening of the film, calling out Candyman in front of a crowd at his book-signing. Ethan furiously questions why the novelist didn't help his father and later attempted to brawl with him in a bar. The novelist, who cynically called on Candyman's name, enters the bar bathroom and is gutted. Annie's mom, Octavia(Veronica Cartwright)hides a secret in a locked drawer and we will find that it holds a key to a certain mystery regarding their family and the Candyman. Annie has a student, Matthew(Joshua Mayweather)who is plagued with dreams of the Candyman, and to satisfy her frightened class that the "hooked-madmen from the mirror" doesn't exist, calls his name across a reflection inviting true horror into her life. The film's mystery is what Candyman's relationship is to Annie. There's a history here that Annie will seek answers for..but will she like what that answer yields? I think why I enjoyed this more than I thought was the atmospheric setting(Mardi Gras, New Orleans, mostly the slums areas), the menacing Todd(an actor I'm quite fond of), the wonderful Philip Glass score, Condon's photography, and the well-staged death sequences. I won't lie to you, this is, above all, a slasher film and director Bill Condon allows Candyman to do some damage in this sequel penetrating quite a few victims through the torso with the hook bursting through the stomach, often lifting them right in the air..Condon, for added effect, often closes in on the horrified expressions of those being thrusted through. My favorite sequence is when Annie re-visits the home of her youth(which was a plantation house with a slaves quarters nearby), follows a walkway into a large room with an altar of candles and skulls enshrined to Candyman with this incredible painted portrait on the wall above of him crying out in anger with his hook and other arm reaching out. There's a great scene where Detective Levesque(David Gianopoulos), who believes wholeheartedly that Annie has been murdering people in the fashion of Candyman with brother Ethan covering up for her, calls on Candyman and is thrown through the interrogation room window after being penetrated through..and extended in the air.. by the true monster.

    I think this movie is really, really underrated. OK, let's star in the first "Candyman (1992)" you don't know if the killer was the Candyman or Helen and that was pretty great. I love that. In this one, the killer IS CANDYMAN, there isn't another explanation. The story of the man's past was well-done and the gore in this film is fantastic. There's a lot of jumps and suspense. The movie stars with a great opening, then it turns a little slow  but, it was alright: In the first one , Candyman appears at the 40 minutes of the movie  and, then, in the ending stars the slasher-gore chasing scenes. The acting was very decent, especially Tony Todd of course. He was as creepy as in the original, and Kelly Rowan was OK. Veronica Cartwright was good too, after her great performance almost 20 year before in "Alien (1979)". In every way, this was a good well-done sequel ALMOST as good as the original. It also features the great soundtrack by Phillip Glass. And it was a lot better than the stupid "Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999)" Enjoyable. 9.5/10.

    Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh is set in New Orleans as the Mardi Gras celebrations are soon to begin, Professor Phillip Purcell (Michael Culkin) is currently promoting his book about the Candyman legend. In an attempt to dismiss the legend he says Candyman five times in a mirror, later that night he is murdered by the hook handed Candyman (Tony Todd) & a guy named Ethan Tarrant (William O'Leary) is accused of his murder. Ethan's sister Annie (Kelly Rowan) sets out to prove her brother innocent & discover the person who killed their father who was murder in a similar way to Purcell, having said Candyman's name in a mirror five times herself he appears & starts to kill her friends & family as he has special plans for her... Directed by Bill Condon this sequel to the original Candyman (1992) was alright but nothing that special. The script by Rand Ravich & Mark Kruger takes itself extremely seriously & moves along at a fairly sedate pace, there is just about enough going on to retain ones interest but there's nothing particularly memorable here. The character's are bland & forgettable, the dialogue the same & even though I saw it only a few hours ago I'm actually struggling to remember anything about it apart from a highly annoying DJ called Kingfisher who makes a regular appearance on the soundtrack. This one spends a fair amount of time on Candyman's background which isn't overly interesting I'm afraid. It plods along, Candyman occasionally turns up to spout some dull speeches & kill the odd person until the somewhat predictable ending where Annie defeats him. The script seems to be full of those annoying false scares as people sneak up on each other & grab their shoulder thereby scaring everyone, why can't people in these type's of films just announce their arrival properly? There's nothing wrong with this sort of cheap scare but it's used several times throughout this film & it grows tiresome. Having said that it's watchable enough I suppose, there's a reasonable body count & while I didn't love it I didn't hate it either. Director Condon does OK, the whole film has a very muted colour scheme which started to get on my nerves after a while. There's an OK atmosphere although there's not much tension going on. There's a few gore scenes, a few people are killed by Candayman with his hook although they are all virtually exactly the same & there's a flashback where Candyman has his hand cut off. Technically the film is good, it looks like it had some money behind it & it's certainly well made. The acting is alright but making this stuff seem believable isn't easy. Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh is average at best, I neither loved nor hated it. It's OK but nothing special. Followed by the straight-to-video Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999).

    Some people just never learn from history. They believe that what happened to others won't be their fate as well. This is what often happens in Horror movie sequels. Some believe the stories and leave well enough alone. Others tell them it's just their imagination. The characters in 'Candyman' messed with something they didn't believe in. It was inevitable that someone else would make the same mistake. Pros: Well acted. Solid directing job. Powerful opening sequence. Though mostly a repeat, Phillip Glass's score is still effective. Atmospheric cinematography. Some quite good effects. A few really chilling sequences. Moves at a nice pace. Cons: Relies too much on false scares. Reveals perhaps too much about the monster's origins. Repeats many plot devices from the original. Final thoughts: The original 'Candyman' was surely a tough act to follow. As a sequel, and on it's own, 'Farewell to the Flesh' works pretty well. So many sequels to Horror films lack the heart of their predecessors. The makers of this one obviously wanted to give us a worthy continuation of the story. For the most part, it's a success. Too bad it didn't end here though. My rating: 3.5/5

    Dreary sequel, despite resetting the narrative to the tale's original location of New Orleans (with flashbacks to the Candyman's grisly fate). This time around, the heroine discovers she's related to the Candyman rather than being a re-incarnation of his white lover; that said, Kelly Rowan is no substitute for Viriginia Madsen! In fact, apart from Tony Todd's titular character (who's even less scary here but, at least, he's intelligible), Michael Culkin's ill-fated professor is the only link to the first film. Other than the requisite gore (and Philip Glass score), again, we have a subplot involving a black child who lives in fear of the Candyman; additionally, however, we get a bit of irrelevant sleaze (this being conveniently set during Mardi Gras)! The presence of veterans Veronica Cartwright and Matt Clark is welcome; predictably, though, they both end up as meat for the Candyman's hook. While director Condon may have started in horror (this is the only one I've watched, actually), he really came into his own when he branched out into other genres  and, quite frankly, I wouldn't have bothered watching this hadn't he been involved...

    I must say I was rather entertained by this ill-received sequel to the original horror hit. I do admit that the film's explanation regarding the origin of Daniel Robitaille's power seemed rather silly(the idea that Candyman's soul was trapped in the mirror of his white lover Caroline due to the extremities of his torment, hate & agony for what the racist white township did to him), but the film has so many things I enjoyed that I was actually able to look past it. Annie(Kelly Rowan, many who watched THE OC might recognize her)is a schoolteacher in New Orleans whose father died at the hook of the Candyman. Her brother, Ethan(William O'Leary), is in jail for the possible murder of a novelist(he wrote a novel about Candyman, was asked by Ethan's father for help), who we see at the opening of the film, calling out Candyman in front of a crowd at his book-signing. Ethan furiously questions why the novelist didn't help his father and later attempted to brawl with him in a bar. The novelist, who cynically called on Candyman's name, enters the bar bathroom and is gutted. Annie's mom, Octavia(Veronica Cartwright)hides a secret in a locked drawer and we will find that it holds a key to a certain mystery regarding their family and the Candyman. Annie has a student, Matthew(Joshua Mayweather)who is plagued with dreams of the Candyman, and to satisfy her frightened class that the "hooked-madmen from the mirror" doesn't exist, calls his name across a reflection inviting true horror into her life. The film's mystery is what Candyman's relationship is to Annie. There's a history here that Annie will seek answers for..but will she like what that answer yields? I think why I enjoyed this more than I thought was the atmospheric setting(Mardi Gras, New Orleans, mostly the slums areas), the menacing Todd(an actor I'm quite fond of), the wonderful Philip Glass score, Condon's photography, and the well-staged death sequences. I won't lie to you, this is, above all, a slasher film and director Bill Condon allows Candyman to do some damage in this sequel penetrating quite a few victims through the torso with the hook bursting through the stomach, often lifting them right in the air..Condon, for added effect, often closes in on the horrified expressions of those being thrusted through. My favorite sequence is when Annie re-visits the home of her youth(which was a plantation house with a slaves quarters nearby), follows a walkway into a large room with an altar of candles and skulls enshrined to Candyman with this incredible painted portrait on the wall above of him crying out in anger with his hook and other arm reaching out. There's a great scene where Detective Levesque(David Gianopoulos), who believes wholeheartedly that Annie has been murdering people in the fashion of Candyman with brother Ethan covering up for her, calls on Candyman and is thrown through the interrogation room window after being penetrated through..and extended in the air.. by the true monster.

    I think this movie is really, really underrated. OK, let's star in the first "Candyman (1992)" you don't know if the killer was the Candyman or Helen and that was pretty great. I love that. In this one, the killer IS CANDYMAN, there isn't another explanation. The story of the man's past was well-done and the gore in this film is fantastic. There's a lot of jumps and suspense. The movie stars with a great opening, then it turns a little slow  but, it was alright: In the first one , Candyman appears at the 40 minutes of the movie  and, then, in the ending stars the slasher-gore chasing scenes. The acting was very decent, especially Tony Todd of course. He was as creepy as in the original, and Kelly Rowan was OK. Veronica Cartwright was good too, after her great performance almost 20 year before in "Alien (1979)". In every way, this was a good well-done sequel ALMOST as good as the original. It also features the great soundtrack by Phillip Glass. And it was a lot better than the stupid "Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999)" Enjoyable. 9.5/10.

    Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh is set in New Orleans as the Mardi Gras celebrations are soon to begin, Professor Phillip Purcell (Michael Culkin) is currently promoting his book about the Candyman legend. In an attempt to dismiss the legend he says Candyman five times in a mirror, later that night he is murdered by the hook handed Candyman (Tony Todd) & a guy named Ethan Tarrant (William O'Leary) is accused of his murder. Ethan's sister Annie (Kelly Rowan) sets out to prove her brother innocent & discover the person who killed their father who was murder in a similar way to Purcell, having said Candyman's name in a mirror five times herself he appears & starts to kill her friends & family as he has special plans for her... Directed by Bill Condon this sequel to the original Candyman (1992) was alright but nothing that special. The script by Rand Ravich & Mark Kruger takes itself extremely seriously & moves along at a fairly sedate pace, there is just about enough going on to retain ones interest but there's nothing particularly memorable here. The character's are bland & forgettable, the dialogue the same & even though I saw it only a few hours ago I'm actually struggling to remember anything about it apart from a highly annoying DJ called Kingfisher who makes a regular appearance on the soundtrack. This one spends a fair amount of time on Candyman's background which isn't overly interesting I'm afraid. It plods along, Candyman occasionally turns up to spout some dull speeches & kill the odd person until the somewhat predictable ending where Annie defeats him. The script seems to be full of those annoying false scares as people sneak up on each other & grab their shoulder thereby scaring everyone, why can't people in these type's of films just announce their arrival properly? There's nothing wrong with this sort of cheap scare but it's used several times throughout this film & it grows tiresome. Having said that it's watchable enough I suppose, there's a reasonable body count & while I didn't love it I didn't hate it either. Director Condon does OK, the whole film has a very muted colour scheme which started to get on my nerves after a while. There's an OK atmosphere although there's not much tension going on. There's a few gore scenes, a few people are killed by Candayman with his hook although they are all virtually exactly the same & there's a flashback where Candyman has his hand cut off. Technically the film is good, it looks like it had some money behind it & it's certainly well made. The acting is alright but making this stuff seem believable isn't easy. Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh is average at best, I neither loved nor hated it. It's OK but nothing special. Followed by the straight-to-video Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999).

    Some people just never learn from history. They believe that what happened to others won't be their fate as well. This is what often happens in Horror movie sequels. Some believe the stories and leave well enough alone. Others tell them it's just their imagination. The characters in 'Candyman' messed with something they didn't believe in. It was inevitable that someone else would make the same mistake. Pros: Well acted. Solid directing job. Powerful opening sequence. Though mostly a repeat, Phillip Glass's score is still effective. Atmospheric cinematography. Some quite good effects. A few really chilling sequences. Moves at a nice pace. Cons: Relies too much on false scares. Reveals perhaps too much about the monster's origins. Repeats many plot devices from the original. Final thoughts: The original 'Candyman' was surely a tough act to follow. As a sequel, and on it's own, 'Farewell to the Flesh' works pretty well. So many sequels to Horror films lack the heart of their predecessors. The makers of this one obviously wanted to give us a worthy continuation of the story. For the most part, it's a success. Too bad it didn't end here though. My rating: 3.5/5

    I was not a big fan of Candyman (1992) as I did not find the movie scary or creepy at all and Candyman did not scare me at all. I saw this movie last weekends, I Can not think of single think that really stood out in the movie, i can't remember much about the movie at all. I found this movie really boring at times but I did find less boring then first movie, i don't why, i the felt candyman was just little bit more creepy this time around. The acting was good from the whole cast but the ending was little rushed I think however it fitted in with rest of the movie. I gave first Candyman 5 out of 10 and the same goes for this movie.

    A good Philip Glass score  albeit one that's rehashed from the original  is the only good thing about this lacklustre sequel that's more like an endless slasher flick than the evocative and atmospheric ghost story of the first film. Here, Candyman is given a back story (and the flashbacks are the only effective part of the production) while going after various characters who may or may not be his own descendants. This is a lifeless and vapid film, one that it's genuinely difficult to watch while keeping your eyes open. Every signposted death is familiar from the original, and no extra lashings of grue are going to change that. The story delivers an uninspiring lead actress (Kelly Rowan) and gives her an equally uninteresting brother (William O'Leary), neither of whom do much to elicit sympathy in the viewer. Tony Todd, of course, is exceptional, but it takes more than a single actor to make a great film. Bill Condon later won plaudits with GODS AND MONSTERS but I found his direction here to be stultifying  and dated in the worst, mid-1990s way. Aside from those aforementioned flashbacks, I can't think of a single moment of life or energy in the entire plot. It's merely uninspired, with Candyman whittling off one character after the other, while way too much time is given to one of those awfully clich&eacute;d sub-plots about the police suspecting an entirely innocent victim of the killings. Throwing in some 'name' character actors like Veronica Cartwright and Bill Nunn doesn't soften the experience, either.

    The only way I can think of that anyone would prefer this to the original is, as much as I hate to use that clich&eacute;, that they did not understand it. There is infinitely more to that brilliant film than "black dude kills people with hook". However, if that was what you liked about it, heck, you might enjoy this. Bigger, not better. The first carefully built up, this goes through the motions. This begins with a dull retelling of the myth(which, as you may remember, took time to get to last time around... and no, that wasn't an accident), and then, perplexingly, proceeds to go over it again(and showing flashbacks to what we already know happened... does a different way of saying the exact same thing count as creativity now?). This spells out what the first hinted at so expertly. Is it really such a tough concept? If we are not told a lot, we will fill in the blanks, and what we imagine will be lightyears past what can be put on a screen. I love this medium, but you can't possibly think that one set idea is superior to each individual viewer's imagination. This tries to explain things that ought to remain unclear, and the effort is boring. Todd gets increased screen-time(and is given lofty-sounding BS to spew, half of it doesn't make a lick of sense... and yes, of course he can deliver it impeccably), and as you probably already know, the man can not look bad regardless of how he is presented. Still, it isn't satisfying. We become used to it, obviously. This awkwardly forces in kills by him, in spite of the strict rules related to that. The continuity is screwed over repeatedly, unless you consider this to be an alternative to the '92 one(it needed no sequels, it was *perfectly* self-contained). This is utterly predictable, it is no longer clever or layered, and the script increases in stupidity at an exponential rate as it progresses, until it spins out of control and then blissfully ends, on what you know is a low note. They didn't even bother to experiment, this uses the same score, and a ton of other things that worked in the film preceding this, without nearing it in atmosphere at all. The plot exists solely to provide a follow-up. A slasher? Arguably, though this is lousy regardless. This has boo-scares that don't pay off by the truckload. The FX are poor(and not necessarily convincing), including the make-up. Acting is decent at best(the kids are *atrocious*). I also personally couldn't stand Kingfish, absolutely painful, and he just would not shut up. What is memorable about this? Name me one thing that is remotely interesting in this, that was introduced in this. There is a lot of disturbing content, bloody(at times gory) violence, a little strong language and sexuality, and brief female nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this purely to those looking for bland horror that delivers what you'd expect and *nothing* else. 5/10

    i liked this follow up to the original Candyman movie.i found it entertaining and the acting is pretty good.i also liked that there was a back story that fleshed out the title character and gave him some humanity.i didn't find the movie scary and there wasn't a lot of gore,so gore hounds will be disappointed.the story itself doesn't have a lot of depth to it,other than the back story.still the movie goes along at a good clip,and it's very stylish,more so than the first one was.was it as good as the original?i think so.i don't think it was better,but it was as good.in terms of entertainment,i thought it was a good movie.if you expect to be scared,you might be disappointed here.otherwise,you might like it.for me,Candyman 2:Farewell to the Flesh is an 8/10

    This was a movie that didn't really need to have been made. The first Candyman did just about everything with the concept that needed to be done whilst keeping the character himself full of mystery and menace. The relationship between the Candyman and Helen was wonderfully drawn, and any sequel would have an insurmountable example to follow. This said, I dug Candyman 2: Farewell to the Flesh quite a bit. Kelly Rowan makes for an appealing heroine, she can act, she's pretty and it's funny to see her pre The OC. Tony Todd is fearsome as ever, although the dialogue isn't up to the standards of the first. The music is pretty much the same I believe, maybe with slight alterations, and it works. Director Bill Condon keeps the film tightly paced and watchable and has a nice sense of atmosphere, although the film doesn't really deliver scares. The handful of kill scenes are nicely bloody and vicious, but the scenes are more efficient than scary. They are fun, and a strong point of the movie, but they just don't have the impact you expect from the Candyman. The strong story and acting are the best thing about this, keeping the film constantly watchable and fun and developing the character of Daniel Robitalle in interesting ways. All considered, I say this is a decent film with a number of cool moments, definitely worthwhile for the horror fans although its best to forget the majestic original before watching.

    Some people just never learn from history. They believe that what happened to others won't be their fate as well. This is what often happens in Horror movie sequels. Some believe the stories and leave well enough alone. Others tell them it's just their imagination. The characters in 'Candyman' messed with something they didn't believe in. It was inevitable that someone else would make the same mistake. Pros: Well acted. Solid directing job. Powerful opening sequence. Though mostly a repeat, Phillip Glass's score is still effective. Atmospheric cinematography. Some quite good effects. A few really chilling sequences. Moves at a nice pace. Cons: Relies too much on false scares. Reveals perhaps too much about the monster's origins. Repeats many plot devices from the original. Final thoughts: The original 'Candyman' was surely a tough act to follow.

Bill Condon later won plaudits with GODS AND MONSTERS but I found his direction here to be stultifying  and dated in the worst, mid-1990s way. Aside from those aforementioned flashbacks, I can't think of a single moment of life or energy in the entire plot. It's merely uninspired, with Candyman whittling off one character after the other, while way too much time is given to one of those awfully clich&eacute;d sub-plots about the police suspecting an entirely innocent victim of the killings. Throwing in some 'name' character actors like Veronica Cartwright and Bill Nunn doesn't soften the experience, either.

    The only way I can think of that anyone would prefer this to the original is, as much as I hate to use that clich&eacute;, that they did not understand it. There is infinitely more to that brilliant film than "black dude kills people with hook". However, if that was what you liked about it, heck, you might enjoy this. Bigger, not better. The first carefully built up, this goes through the motions. This begins with a dull retelling of the myth(which, as you may remember, took time to get to last time around... and no, that wasn't an accident), and then, perplexingly, proceeds to go over it again(and showing flashbacks to what we already know happened... does a different way of saying the exact same thing count as creativity now?). This spells out what the first hinted at so expertly. Is it really such a tough concept? If we are not told a lot, we will fill in the blanks, and what we imagine will be lightyears past what can be put on a screen. I love this medium, but you can't possibly think that one set idea is superior to each individual viewer's imagination. This tries to explain things that ought to remain unclear, and the effort is boring. Todd gets increased screen-time(and is given lofty-sounding BS to spew, half of it doesn't make a lick of sense... and yes, of course he can deliver it impeccably), and as you probably already know, the man can not look bad regardless of how he is presented. Still, it isn't satisfying. We become used to it, obviously. This awkwardly forces in kills by him, in spite of the strict rules related to that. The continuity is screwed over repeatedly, unless you consider this to be an alternative to the '92 one(it needed no sequels, it was *perfectly* self-contained). This is utterly predictable, it is no longer clever or layered, and the script increases in stupidity at an exponential rate as it progresses, until it spins out of control and then blissfully ends, on what you know is a low note. They didn't even bother to experiment, this uses the same score, and a ton of other things that worked in the film preceding this, without nearing it in atmosphere at all. The plot exists solely to provide a follow-up. A slasher? Arguably, though this is lousy regardless. This has boo-scares that don't pay off by the truckload. The FX are poor(and not necessarily convincing), including the make-up. Acting is decent at best(the kids are *atrocious*). I also personally couldn't stand Kingfish, absolutely painful, and he just would not shut up. What is memorable about this? Name me one thing that is remotely interesting in this, that was introduced in this. There is a lot of disturbing content, bloody(at times gory) violence, a little strong language and sexuality, and brief female nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this purely to those looking for bland horror that delivers what you'd expect and *nothing* else. 5/10

    i liked this follow up to the original Candyman movie.i found it entertaining and the acting is pretty good.i also liked that there was a back story that fleshed out the title character and gave him some humanity.i didn't find the movie scary and there wasn't a lot of gore,so gore hounds will be disappointed.the story itself doesn't have a lot of depth to it,other than the back story.still the movie goes along at a good clip,and it's very stylish,more so than the first one was.was it as good as the original?i think so.i don't think it was better,but it was as good.in terms of entertainment,i thought it was a good movie.if you expect to be scared,you might be disappointed here.otherwise,you might like it.for me,Candyman 2:Farewell to the Flesh is an 8/10

    This was a movie that didn't really need to have been made. The first Candyman did just about everything with the concept that needed to be done whilst keeping the character himself full of mystery and menace. The relationship between the Candyman and Helen was wonderfully drawn, and any sequel would have an insurmountable example to follow. This said, I dug Candyman 2: Farewell to the Flesh quite a bit. Kelly Rowan makes for an appealing heroine, she can act, she's pretty and it's funny to see her pre The OC. Tony Todd is fearsome as ever, although the dialogue isn't up to the standards of the first. The music is pretty much the same I believe, maybe with slight alterations, and it works. Director Bill Condon keeps the film tightly paced and watchable and has a nice sense of atmosphere, although the film doesn't really deliver scares. The handful of kill scenes are nicely bloody and vicious, but the scenes are more efficient than scary. They are fun, and a strong point of the movie, but they just don't have the impact you expect from the Candyman. The strong story and acting are the best thing about this, keeping the film constantly watchable and fun and developing the character of Daniel Robitalle in interesting ways. All considered, I say this is a decent film with a number of cool moments, definitely worthwhile for the horror fans although its best to forget the majestic original before watching.

    Dreary sequel, despite resetting the narrative to the tale's original location of New Orleans (with flashbacks to the Candyman's grisly fate). This time around, the heroine discovers she's related to the Candyman rather than being a re-incarnation of his white lover; that said, Kelly Rowan is no substitute for Viriginia Madsen! In fact, apart from Tony Todd's titular character (who's even less scary here but, at least, he's intelligible), Michael Culkin's ill-fated professor is the only link to the first film. Other than the requisite gore (and Philip Glass score), again, we have a subplot involving a black child who lives in fear of the Candyman; additionally, however, we get a bit of irrelevant sleaze (this being conveniently set during Mardi Gras)! The presence of veterans Veronica Cartwright and Matt Clark is welcome; predictably, though, they both end up as meat for the Candyman's hook. While director Condon may have started in horror (this is the only one I've watched, actually), he really came into his own when he branched out into other genres  and, quite frankly, I wouldn't have bothered watching this hadn't he been involved...

    I must say I was rather entertained by this ill-received sequel to the original horror hit. I do admit that the film's explanation regarding the origin of Daniel Robitaille's power seemed rather silly(the idea that Candyman's soul was trapped in the mirror of his white lover Caroline due to the extremities of his torment, hate & agony for what the racist white township did to him), but the film has so many things I enjoyed that I was actually able to look past it. Annie(Kelly Rowan, many who watched THE OC might recognize her)is a schoolteacher in New Orleans whose father died at the hook of the Candyman. Her brother, Ethan(William O'Leary), is in jail for the possible murder of a novelist(he wrote a novel about Candyman, was asked by Ethan's father for help), who we see at the opening of the film, calling out Candyman in front of a crowd at his book-signing. Ethan furiously questions why the novelist didn't help his father and later attempted to brawl with him in a bar. The novelist, who cynically called on Candyman's name, enters the bar bathroom and is gutted. Annie's mom, Octavia(Veronica Cartwright)hides a secret in a locked drawer and we will find that it holds a key to a certain mystery regarding their family and the Candyman. Annie has a student, Matthew(Joshua Mayweather)who is plagued with dreams of the Candyman, and to satisfy her frightened class that the "hooked-madmen from the mirror" doesn't exist, calls his name across a reflection inviting true horror into her life. The film's mystery is what Candyman's relationship is to Annie. There's a history here that Annie will seek answers for..but will she like what that answer yields? I think why I enjoyed this more than I thought was the atmospheric setting(Mardi Gras, New Orleans, mostly the slums areas), the menacing Todd(an actor I'm quite fond of), the wonderful Philip Glass score, Condon's photography, and the well-staged death sequences. I won't lie to you, this is, above all, a slasher film and director Bill Condon allows Candyman to do some damage in this sequel penetrating quite a few victims through the torso with the hook bursting through the stomach, often lifting them right in the air..Condon, for added effect, often closes in on the horrified expressions of those being thrusted through. My favorite sequence is when Annie re-visits the home of her youth(which was a plantation house with a slaves quarters nearby), follows a walkway into a large room with an altar of candles and skulls enshrined to Candyman with this incredible painted portrait on the wall above of him crying out in anger with his hook and other arm reaching out. There's a great scene where Detective Levesque(David Gianopoulos), who believes wholeheartedly that Annie has been murdering people in the fashion of Candyman with brother Ethan covering up for her, calls on Candyman and is thrown through the interrogation room window after being penetrated through..and extended in the air.. by the true monster.

    I think this movie is really, really underrated. OK, let's star in the first "Candyman (1992)" you don't know if the killer was the Candyman or Helen and that was pretty great. I love that. In this one, the killer IS CANDYMAN, there isn't another explanation. The story of the man's past was well-done and the gore in this film is fantastic. There's a lot of jumps and suspense. The movie stars with a great opening, then it turns a little slow  but, it was alright: In the first one , Candyman appears at the 40 minutes of the movie  and, then, in the ending stars the slasher-gore chasing scenes. The acting was very decent, especially Tony Todd of course. He was as creepy as in the original, and Kelly Rowan was OK. Veronica Cartwright was good too, after her great performance almost 20 year before in "Alien (1979)". In every way, this was a good well-done sequel ALMOST as good as the original. It also features the great soundtrack by Phillip Glass. And it was a lot better than the stupid "Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999)" Enjoyable. 9.5/10.

    Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh is set in New Orleans as the Mardi Gras celebrations are soon to begin, Professor Phillip Purcell (Michael Culkin) is currently promoting his book about the Candyman legend. In an attempt to dismiss the legend he says Candyman five times in a mirror, later that night he is murdered by the hook handed Candyman (Tony Todd) & a guy named Ethan Tarrant (William O'Leary) is accused of his murder. Ethan's sister Annie (Kelly Rowan) sets out to prove her brother innocent & discover the person who killed their father who was murder in a similar way to Purcell, having said Candyman's name in a mirror five times herself he appears & starts to kill her friends & family as he has special plans for her... Directed by Bill Condon this sequel to the original Candyman (1992) was alright but nothing that special. The script by Rand Ravich & Mark Kruger takes itself extremely seriously & moves along at a fairly sedate pace, there is just about enough going on to retain ones interest but there's nothing particularly memorable here. The character's are bland & forgettable, the dialogue the same & even though I saw it only a few hours ago I'm actually struggling to remember anything about it apart from a highly annoying DJ called Kingfisher who makes a regular appearance on the soundtrack. This one spends a fair amount of time on Candyman's background which isn't overly interesting I'm afraid. It plods along, Candyman occasionally turns up to spout some dull speeches & kill the odd person until the somewhat predictable ending where Annie defeats him. The script seems to be full of those annoying false scares as people sneak up on each other & grab their shoulder thereby scaring everyone, why can't people in these type's of films just announce their arrival properly? There's nothing wrong with this sort of cheap scare but it's used several times throughout this film & it grows tiresome. Having said that it's watchable enough I suppose, there's a reasonable body count & while I didn't love it I didn't hate it either. Director Condon does OK, the whole film has a very muted colour scheme which started to get on my nerves after a while. There's an OK atmosphere although there's not much tension going on. There's a few gore scenes, a few people are killed by Candayman with his hook although they are all virtually exactly the same & there's a flashback where Candyman has his hand cut off. Technically the film is good, it looks like it had some money behind it & it's certainly well made. The acting is alright but making this stuff seem believable isn't easy. Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh is average at best, I neither loved nor hated it. It's OK but nothing special. Followed by the straight-to-video Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999).

    Some people just never learn from history. They believe that what happened to others won't be their fate as well. This is what often happens in Horror movie sequels. Some believe the stories and leave well enough alone. Others tell them it's just their imagination. The characters in 'Candyman' messed with something they didn't believe in. It was inevitable that someone else would make the same mistake. Pros: Well acted. Solid directing job. Powerful opening sequence. Though mostly a repeat, Phillip Glass's score is still effective. Atmospheric cinematography. Some quite good effects. A few really chilling sequences. Moves at a nice pace. Cons: Relies too much on false scares. Reveals perhaps too much about the monster's origins. Repeats many plot devices from the original. Final thoughts: The original 'Candyman' was surely a tough act to follow. As a sequel, and on it's own, 'Farewell to the Flesh' works pretty well. So many sequels to Horror films lack the heart of their predecessors. The makers of this one obviously wanted to give us a worthy continuation of the story. For the most part, it's a success. Too bad it didn't end here though. My rating: 3.5/5

    I was not a big fan of Candyman (1992) as I did not find the movie scary or creepy at all and Candyman did not scare me at all. I saw this movie last weekends, I Can not think of single think that really stood out in the movie, i can't remember much about the movie at all. I found this movie really boring at times but I did find less boring then first movie, i don't why, i the felt candyman was just little bit more creepy this time around. The acting was good from the whole cast but the ending was little rushed I think however it fitted in with rest of the movie. I gave first Candyman 5 out of 10 and the same goes for this movie.

    A good Philip Glass score  albeit one that's rehashed from the original  is the only good thing about this lacklustre sequel that's more like an endless slasher flick than the evocative and atmospheric ghost story of the first film. Here, Candyman is given a back story (and the flashbacks are the only effective part of the production) while going after various characters who may or may not be his own descendants. This is a lifeless and vapid film, one that it's genuinely difficult to watch while keeping your eyes open. Every signposted death is familiar from the original, and no extra lashings of grue are going to change that. The story delivers an uninspiring lead actress (Kelly Rowan) and gives her an equally uninteresting brother (William O'Leary), neither of whom do much to elicit sympathy in the viewer. Tony Todd, of course, is exceptional, but it takes more than a single actor to make a great film. Bill Condon later won plaudits with GODS AND MONSTERS but I found his direction here to be stultifying  and dated in the worst, mid-1990s way. Aside from those aforementioned flashbacks, I can't think of a single moment of life or energy in the entire plot. It's merely uninspired, with Candyman whittling off one character after the other, while way too much time is given to one of those awfully clich&eacute;d sub-plots about the police suspecting an entirely innocent victim of the killings. Throwing in some 'name' character actors like Veronica Cartwright and Bill Nunn doesn't soften the experience, either.

Veronica Cartwright was good too, after her great performance almost 20 year before in "Alien (1979)". In every way, this was a good well-done sequel ALMOST as good as the original. It also features the great soundtrack by Phillip Glass. And it was a lot better than the stupid "Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999)" Enjoyable. 9.5/10.

    Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh is set in New Orleans as the Mardi Gras celebrations are soon to begin, Professor Phillip Purcell (Michael Culkin) is currently promoting his book about the Candyman legend. In an attempt to dismiss the legend he says Candyman five times in a mirror, later that night he is murdered by the hook handed Candyman (Tony Todd) & a guy named Ethan Tarrant (William O'Leary) is accused of his murder. Ethan's sister Annie (Kelly Rowan) sets out to prove her brother innocent & discover the person who killed their father who was murder in a similar way to Purcell, having said Candyman's name in a mirror five times herself he appears & starts to kill her friends & family as he has special plans for her... Directed by Bill Condon this sequel to the original Candyman (1992) was alright but nothing that special. The script by Rand Ravich & Mark Kruger takes itself extremely seriously & moves along at a fairly sedate pace, there is just about enough going on to retain ones interest but there's nothing particularly memorable here. The character's are bland & forgettable, the dialogue the same & even though I saw it only a few hours ago I'm actually struggling to remember anything about it apart from a highly annoying DJ called Kingfisher who makes a regular appearance on the soundtrack. This one spends a fair amount of time on Candyman's background which isn't overly interesting I'm afraid. It plods along, Candyman occasionally turns up to spout some dull speeches & kill the odd person until the somewhat predictable ending where Annie defeats him. The script seems to be full of those annoying false scares as people sneak up on each other & grab their shoulder thereby scaring everyone, why can't people in these type's of films just announce their arrival properly? There's nothing wrong with this sort of cheap scare but it's used several times throughout this film & it grows tiresome. Having said that it's watchable enough I suppose, there's a reasonable body count & while I didn't love it I didn't hate it either. Director Condon does OK, the whole film has a very muted colour scheme which started to get on my nerves after a while. There's an OK atmosphere although there's not much tension going on. There's a few gore scenes, a few people are killed by Candayman with his hook although they are all virtually exactly the same & there's a flashback where Candyman has his hand cut off. Technically the film is good, it looks like it had some money behind it & it's certainly well made. The acting is alright but making this stuff seem believable isn't easy. Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh is average at best, I neither loved nor hated it. It's OK but nothing special. Followed by the straight-to-video Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999).

    Some people just never learn from history. They believe that what happened to others won't be their fate as well. This is what often happens in Horror movie sequels. Some believe the stories and leave well enough alone. Others tell them it's just their imagination. The characters in 'Candyman' messed with something they didn't believe in. It was inevitable that someone else would make the same mistake. Pros: Well acted. Solid directing job. Powerful opening sequence. Though mostly a repeat, Phillip Glass's score is still effective. Atmospheric cinematography. Some quite good effects. A few really chilling sequences. Moves at a nice pace. Cons: Relies too much on false scares. Reveals perhaps too much about the monster's origins. Repeats many plot devices from the original. Final thoughts: The original 'Candyman' was surely a tough act to follow. As a sequel, and on it's own, 'Farewell to the Flesh' works pretty well. So many sequels to Horror films lack the heart of their predecessors. The makers of this one obviously wanted to give us a worthy continuation of the story. For the most part, it's a success. Too bad it didn't end here though. My rating: 3.5/5

    I was not a big fan of Candyman (1992) as I did not find the movie scary or creepy at all and Candyman did not scare me at all. I saw this movie last weekends, I Can not think of single think that really stood out in the movie, i can't remember much about the movie at all. I found this movie really boring at times but I did find less boring then first movie, i don't why, i the felt candyman was just little bit more creepy this time around. The acting was good from the whole cast but the ending was little rushed I think however it fitted in with rest of the movie. I gave first Candyman 5 out of 10 and the same goes for this movie.

    A good Philip Glass score  albeit one that's rehashed from the original  is the only good thing about this lacklustre sequel that's more like an endless slasher flick than the evocative and atmospheric ghost story of the first film. Here, Candyman is given a back story (and the flashbacks are the only effective part of the production) while going after various characters who may or may not be his own descendants. This is a lifeless and vapid film, one that it's genuinely difficult to watch while keeping your eyes open. Every signposted death is familiar from the original, and no extra lashings of grue are going to change that. The story delivers an uninspiring lead actress (Kelly Rowan) and gives her an equally uninteresting brother (William O'Leary), neither of whom do much to elicit sympathy in the viewer. Tony Todd, of course, is exceptional, but it takes more than a single actor to make a great film. Bill Condon later won plaudits with GODS AND MONSTERS but I found his direction here to be stultifying  and dated in the worst, mid-1990s way. Aside from those aforementioned flashbacks, I can't think of a single moment of life or energy in the entire plot. It's merely uninspired, with Candyman whittling off one character after the other, while way too much time is given to one of those awfully clich&eacute;d sub-plots about the police suspecting an entirely innocent victim of the killings. Throwing in some 'name' character actors like Veronica Cartwright and Bill Nunn doesn't soften the experience, either.

    The only way I can think of that anyone would prefer this to the original is, as much as I hate to use that clich&eacute;, that they did not understand it. There is infinitely more to that brilliant film than "black dude kills people with hook". However, if that was what you liked about it, heck, you might enjoy this. Bigger, not better. The first carefully built up, this goes through the motions. This begins with a dull retelling of the myth(which, as you may remember, took time to get to last time around... and no, that wasn't an accident), and then, perplexingly, proceeds to go over it again(and showing flashbacks to what we already know happened... does a different way of saying the exact same thing count as creativity now?). This spells out what the first hinted at so expertly. Is it really such a tough concept? If we are not told a lot, we will fill in the blanks, and what we imagine will be lightyears past what can be put on a screen. I love this medium, but you can't possibly think that one set idea is superior to each individual viewer's imagination. This tries to explain things that ought to remain unclear, and the effort is boring. Todd gets increased screen-time(and is given lofty-sounding BS to spew, half of it doesn't make a lick of sense... and yes, of course he can deliver it impeccably), and as you probably already know, the man can not look bad regardless of how he is presented. Still, it isn't satisfying. We become used to it, obviously. This awkwardly forces in kills by him, in spite of the strict rules related to that. The continuity is screwed over repeatedly, unless you consider this to be an alternative to the '92 one(it needed no sequels, it was *perfectly* self-contained). This is utterly predictable, it is no longer clever or layered, and the script increases in stupidity at an exponential rate as it progresses, until it spins out of control and then blissfully ends, on what you know is a low note. They didn't even bother to experiment, this uses the same score, and a ton of other things that worked in the film preceding this, without nearing it in atmosphere at all. The plot exists solely to provide a follow-up. A slasher? Arguably, though this is lousy regardless. This has boo-scares that don't pay off by the truckload. The FX are poor(and not necessarily convincing), including the make-up. Acting is decent at best(the kids are *atrocious*). I also personally couldn't stand Kingfish, absolutely painful, and he just would not shut up. What is memorable about this? Name me one thing that is remotely interesting in this, that was introduced in this. There is a lot of disturbing content, bloody(at times gory) violence, a little strong language and sexuality, and brief female nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this purely to those looking for bland horror that delivers what you'd expect and *nothing* else. 5/10

    i liked this follow up to the original Candyman movie.i found it entertaining and the acting is pretty good.i also liked that there was a back story that fleshed out the title character and gave him some humanity.i didn't find the movie scary and there wasn't a lot of gore,so gore hounds will be disappointed.the story itself doesn't have a lot of depth to it,other than the back story.still the movie goes along at a good clip,and it's very stylish,more so than the first one was.was it as good as the original?i think so.i don't think it was better,but it was as good.in terms of entertainment,i thought it was a good movie.if you expect to be scared,you might be disappointed here.otherwise,you might like it.for me,Candyman 2:Farewell to the Flesh is an 8/10

    This was a movie that didn't really need to have been made. The first Candyman did just about everything with the concept that needed to be done whilst keeping the character himself full of mystery and menace. The relationship between the Candyman and Helen was wonderfully drawn, and any sequel would have an insurmountable example to follow. This said, I dug Candyman 2: Farewell to the Flesh quite a bit. Kelly Rowan makes for an appealing heroine, she can act, she's pretty and it's funny to see her pre The OC. Tony Todd is fearsome as ever, although the dialogue isn't up to the standards of the first. The music is pretty much the same I believe, maybe with slight alterations, and it works. Director Bill Condon keeps the film tightly paced and watchable and has a nice sense of atmosphere, although the film doesn't really deliver scares. The handful of kill scenes are nicely bloody and vicious, but the scenes are more efficient than scary. They are fun, and a strong point of the movie, but they just don't have the impact you expect from the Candyman. The strong story and acting are the best thing about this, keeping the film constantly watchable and fun and developing the character of Daniel Robitalle in interesting ways. All considered, I say this is a decent film with a number of cool moments, definitely worthwhile for the horror fans although its best to forget the majestic original before watching.

    Dreary sequel, despite resetting the narrative to the tale's original location of New Orleans (with flashbacks to the Candyman's grisly fate). This time around, the heroine discovers she's related to the Candyman rather than being a re-incarnation of his white lover; that said, Kelly Rowan is no substitute for Viriginia Madsen! In fact, apart from Tony Todd's titular character (who's even less scary here but, at least, he's intelligible), Michael Culkin's ill-fated professor is the only link to the first film. Other than the requisite gore (and Philip Glass score), again, we have a subplot involving a black child who lives in fear of the Candyman; additionally, however, we get a bit of irrelevant sleaze (this being conveniently set during Mardi Gras)! The presence of veterans Veronica Cartwright and Matt Clark is welcome; predictably, though, they both end up as meat for the Candyman's hook. While director Condon may have started in horror (this is the only one I've watched, actually), he really came into his own when he branched out into other genres  and, quite frankly, I wouldn't have bothered watching this hadn't he been involved...

    I must say I was rather entertained by this ill-received sequel to the original horror hit. I do admit that the film's explanation regarding the origin of Daniel Robitaille's power seemed rather silly(the idea that Candyman's soul was trapped in the mirror of his white lover Caroline due to the extremities of his torment, hate & agony for what the racist white township did to him), but the film has so many things I enjoyed that I was actually able to look past it. Annie(Kelly Rowan, many who watched THE OC might recognize her)is a schoolteacher in New Orleans whose father died at the hook of the Candyman. Her brother, Ethan(William O'Leary), is in jail for the possible murder of a novelist(he wrote a novel about Candyman, was asked by Ethan's father for help), who we see at the opening of the film, calling out Candyman in front of a crowd at his book-signing. Ethan furiously questions why the novelist didn't help his father and later attempted to brawl with him in a bar. The novelist, who cynically called on Candyman's name, enters the bar bathroom and is gutted. Annie's mom, Octavia(Veronica Cartwright)hides a secret in a locked drawer and we will find that it holds a key to a certain mystery regarding their family and the Candyman. Annie has a student, Matthew(Joshua Mayweather)who is plagued with dreams of the Candyman, and to satisfy her frightened class that the "hooked-madmen from the mirror" doesn't exist, calls his name across a reflection inviting true horror into her life. The film's mystery is what Candyman's relationship is to Annie. There's a history here that Annie will seek answers for..but will she like what that answer yields? I think why I enjoyed this more than I thought was the atmospheric setting(Mardi Gras, New Orleans, mostly the slums areas), the menacing Todd(an actor I'm quite fond of), the wonderful Philip Glass score, Condon's photography, and the well-staged death sequences. I won't lie to you, this is, above all, a slasher film and director Bill Condon allows Candyman to do some damage in this sequel penetrating quite a few victims through the torso with the hook bursting through the stomach, often lifting them right in the air..Condon, for added effect, often closes in on the horrified expressions of those being thrusted through. My favorite sequence is when Annie re-visits the home of her youth(which was a plantation house with a slaves quarters nearby), follows a walkway into a large room with an altar of candles and skulls enshrined to Candyman with this incredible painted portrait on the wall above of him crying out in anger with his hook and other arm reaching out. There's a great scene where Detective Levesque(David Gianopoulos), who believes wholeheartedly that Annie has been murdering people in the fashion of Candyman with brother Ethan covering up for her, calls on Candyman and is thrown through the interrogation room window after being penetrated through..and extended in the air.. by the true monster.

    I think this movie is really, really underrated. OK, let's star in the first "Candyman (1992)" you don't know if the killer was the Candyman or Helen and that was pretty great. I love that. In this one, the killer IS CANDYMAN, there isn't another explanation. The story of the man's past was well-done and the gore in this film is fantastic. There's a lot of jumps and suspense. The movie stars with a great opening, then it turns a little slow  but, it was alright: In the first one , Candyman appears at the 40 minutes of the movie  and, then, in the ending stars the slasher-gore chasing scenes. The acting was very decent, especially Tony Todd of course. He was as creepy as in the original, and Kelly Rowan was OK. Veronica Cartwright was good too, after her great performance almost 20 year before in "Alien (1979)". In every way, this was a good well-done sequel ALMOST as good as the original. It also features the great soundtrack by Phillip Glass. And it was a lot better than the stupid "Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999)" Enjoyable. 9.5/10.
