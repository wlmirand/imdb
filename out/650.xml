    I will keep this as short as possible - Boring. Do now waste your time watching this rubbish. Seriously, I can not think of one good thing about this movie.I am not going to waste time by going through the details of this movie which where bad because I would be here all day. I'll tell you why people rate this thrash though, this movie is yet another case of 'The Emperors new clothing', it makes the movie Citizen Kane look entertaining or somewhat interesting in comparison. At least Citizen Kane used (at the time) innovating cinematography. This has zilch going for it. i bet you people only say they rate it because they are afraid of looking like philistines by the snobs, who I doubt even watched the full 90 minutes - And I don't blame them. DO NOT WATCH.

    I have stated many times that Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite film makers of all time. I, like many others, see him as a visionary, a shining example of an amazing film maker. His films are like no other's, there are layers beyond layers that can only hope to be unraveled in his works. Few film makers have achieved such artistic success as Bergman and few ever will. Though his films may share similar themes, they all bear their own drastically defining characteristics. "The Seventh Seal" is a film I first saw nearly a year ago and did not fully appreciate until I revisited it more recently. Bear in mind that this like most or Bergman's films require multiple viewings to even begin a discussion. In the first scenes of the film we see a vast seashore and a knight awaking on it. He is approached by a mysterious hooded figure that reveals himself as Death. The knight, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from the Crusades to a plague infested Sweden. Death claims that he has come for him and that his time in the world of the living is up. In order to hinder Death's deed, Antonius proposes a game of chess between the two. If he is to win the game, Death will set him free. The film also follows a wide variety of other character's that towards the end come together. When reviewing an Ingmar Bergman film, I don't care to greatly indulge on the plot, especially with this film, as I fear it will take away from the film's charm. Ingmar Begman seems to be very fascinated with God and faith. This is a film that shows you the burden faith can bring. I believe that Bergman directed this film by channeling his own inner struggles into his art, like many great artists have done and still do. The main character of the film is on the verge of loosing his faith in God, he wants to believe, but he does not see any proof backing God's existence. This is something most people have struggled with during the course of their live and I believe Bergman did as well. You don't see film's like these nowadays and I know everyone has been saying this over and over again, but "The Seventh Seal" possesses a type of beauty that could only be captured by someone like Ingmar Bergman and it is a rare occasion that someone like him comes around. The lighting and shadows in this film add to the already beautiful black and white visuals. In my opinion the most beautiful scenes visually have to be the opening scene and the ending scenes (not going to spoil it) To take in the beauty and to somewhat understand "The Seventh Seal" you have to watch it multiple times. The visuals, music and the overall ambiance of the film added to the already outright fantastic story and powerful underlying themes creates a beautifully eery film. I have praised Ingmar Bergman and his films enough already, all I have to say it "The Seventh Seal" is a masterpiece and an untouchable classic.

    A man seeks answers about life, death, and the existence of God as he plays chess against the Grim Reaper during the Black Plague. That fooled me. The movie is not that interesting. Some people might analyze each and every scene and dialog and come up with their own interpretations of what Bergman wanted to say. Jacksh*t. Now usually i love such kind of movies. I am not a fan of commercial craps like fast and furious or the recent man of steel. I am a sucker for good stories, script and character development but this movie had nothing.The dialogs were so darn lame a 14 y.o. could have written them. The pace was so slow the movie felt more like 150 minutes instead of its 90 minute run time. This is the second Bergman film i have viewed, the first being Persona which i also felt was overrated but at least kept me interested and concerned with it all along. I am sure this guy knew his movies but one doesn't make movies only for their fans but for a wider audience. How could you call this guy an artist. All he ever does is try to make a deep engrossing movie that asks its viewers certain important questions about life and the idea of a god but what he ends up making is a sh*t sandwich that should never be viewed under any circumstances. 1/10

    Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, "The Seventh Seal" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. Taking its title from the Book of Revelation, "The Seventh Seal" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: "I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me," he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented. Bergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (&Aring;ke Fridell), squire J&ouml;ns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.

    Plot: A Knight, Antonius Block, returns to his homeland Sweden with his squire (Jons), from a ten year long Crusade, only to find his country in the clutches of infamous plague--the Black Death (mid-1300s). On his journey home, he encounters the physical form of death itself (Bengt Ekerot) and engages him in an intriguing game of Chess to actually buy some time for some purpose of his. In this Swedish masterpiece the director, very artistically, collaborates tragic events of Europe caused by a widespread plague (bubonic plague-symptoms include a Swollen gland) with the "Book Of Revelation" primarily focusing on Apocalypse. The main characters have been chosen such that they represent various personalities and mental states of the sufferers. For example, the knight represents a delusional person who isn't sure if his Crusade had any point to it, his squire--a good man at heart--wonders where is God in this hour of need, the priest represents a power hungry man who instills fear in the society for his own benefit. The young actor couple and their child represent a God loving family who will survive the calamity. The whole country is suffering and there is confusion everywhere. People are punishing themselves to achieve absolution. Among all this hardship there still are people who are jolly and enjoying their lives to the hilt. Some of them are realizing their true selves. Even the Knight finds a purpose to his life and saves the young family from the clutches of Death. He eventually, with his wife and followers, dances with the Death. This 'dance' has become an iconic image of world cinema. A definite must watch. 8.5/10

    The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's take on religion and death. The film follows the story of Antonius Block, a knight who is returning home after having gone through the crusades. The country is now dominated by the Black Death and he ends up facing the grim reaper himself during his trip. The scenes between both of these characters are often intriguing, chilling and even comical. Block constantly questions the meaning of life and tries to accept his fatal destiny. The scenes with the witch character were very moving and illustrated how merciless and radical people could be at that period. I have one gripe with the film which is basically the acting. While most of the cast provides great performances (Especially Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot), I found some of the secondary characters like Jof, Mia and Blacksmith Plog annoying at times. Bergman uses a lot of theatricality here and I felt that there were scenes involving these folks, which were too repetitive and a bit dull. However, the overall result is mesmerizing and a definite must-see for those who are fans of Bergman's work or everyone who just appreciates a quality introspective film.

    The events and themes of Ingar Bergman's classic The Seventh Seal show numerous examples of existentialism. Throughout the film, characters blame occurrences such as the black plague on God, helplessly resorting to the idea that they have no individual control over their destinies. Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who "hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles." The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choicesas is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival.

    Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal follows the final days of a knight, and an accompanying band of his squire, actors, and a blacksmith, as he plays chess with Death, his life hanging in the balance. Ominous and foreboding, Bergman steeps The Seventh Seal with existentialist philosophy akin to Sartre's atheist existentialism found in "Existentialism is a Humanism." Much of the knight's journey through the film mirrors Sartre's atheistic existentialist notions of anguish, despair, and abandonment. Sartre, unlike others, states that the lack of a God is not simply met with mere acceptance; rather, the person experiences these three feelings. The knight exhibits the anguish, which Sartre suggests is a consequence of one wondering "What would happen if everyone did what I am doing?," early in the film when he ponders "Through my indifference for people, I've been placed outside of their society." The abandonment, similarly, is shown through the knight throughout the film. Having realized his inability to find God, the knight requests to meet Satan, who the knight believes "He if anyone" must know God, via an alleged witch waiting for execution. Despite the witch's insistence that Satan is all around her and easily seen, the knight, alas, sees nothing. Finally, in the closing moments of the film, as Death presents himself to the knight, the squire, the blacksmith, and their accompanying women, the knight tries one final time to beseech God. However, the squire asserts that "In that darkness where you reside, where we probably all reside, you'll find no one that listens to your complaint or is moved by your suffering." In addition to showing the knight's abandonment issue, the squire implies Sartre's final feeling, despair, in that the squire understands that, in the absence of God, man must "limit" himself "to reckoning only with those things that depend of (his) will" and not that of others.

    Existentialism and the Seventh Seal I was surprised to learn that I had actually seen this movie before, though I was drunk of the Raven's wine and its deeper vision escaped me. The Seventh Seal is the search for meaning in the absence of a present and firm God and aligns to Jean Paul Sartre's ideal of atheistic existentialism. How does the knight know Death is Death? Death appears as a man in black's cloak. He says he is Death, but offers no proof of his power. The Knight seems to intrinsically know the mask of Death. Does the Knight wish to see Death and thus calls Death to him? To the outsider, the meeting is unknowable, but to the Knight the meeting is with Death. This suggests and with accordance to Sartre that visions are defined by what they are decided to be. The acrobat sees a vision of a woman with child. He takes her and him to be the Virgin May and the Babe of God. I did not make this interpretation, and saw only the visual of the acrobat's vision. Is it possible to interpret our own visions impartially? If a man comes in black calling himself Death, should I operate under the principle he is Death or not Death. I can play the game under the pretense Death is Death, but I should always remain skeptical of Death being not Death. In this way, I can be part of reality and also I can be the third party viewer who provides a source of skepticism. Death- "Will you ever stop asking questions? But you get no answer." Death is neither God nor the Devil. The Knight recognizes Death is the emptiness left by the absence of God, yet he is compelled to probe emptiness. What does the Knight learn from his probing? He learns terror. He learns his meaning is found with his waiting wife. Sartre would be proud of the Knight, who pushes even through emptiness to find meaning in what was already there. He learns to treasure and become his memories, joy from strawberries and milk. Is this the fate of man, to believe in visions and signs of God founded in our own minds but sublimated unto the world? The Black Plague was caused by man's fear and elimination of cats that did not eat the rats of decay. God must be a cat.

    This film is a deep and dynamic contemplation on death, god, and purpose. The story follows Jons and Jof as they return home from warring through the crusades after 10 years away. On their return Johns encounters Death, who he challenges to a game of chess, wagering his life for the win. Throughout the story characters contemplate what is the meaning of life in all of the suffering that is going on around them. Jons, as does the character Socrates, wonders what is the true meaning of his existence. He questions the purpose of the war he has fought. He questions why the God he has fought for will not speak to him and show him meaning. This movie was a truly memorable experience and anyone with any interest in philosophy should check it out.

Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who "hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles." The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choicesas is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival.

    Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal follows the final days of a knight, and an accompanying band of his squire, actors, and a blacksmith, as he plays chess with Death, his life hanging in the balance. Ominous and foreboding, Bergman steeps The Seventh Seal with existentialist philosophy akin to Sartre's atheist existentialism found in "Existentialism is a Humanism." Much of the knight's journey through the film mirrors Sartre's atheistic existentialist notions of anguish, despair, and abandonment. Sartre, unlike others, states that the lack of a God is not simply met with mere acceptance; rather, the person experiences these three feelings. The knight exhibits the anguish, which Sartre suggests is a consequence of one wondering "What would happen if everyone did what I am doing?," early in the film when he ponders "Through my indifference for people, I've been placed outside of their society." The abandonment, similarly, is shown through the knight throughout the film. Having realized his inability to find God, the knight requests to meet Satan, who the knight believes "He if anyone" must know God, via an alleged witch waiting for execution. Despite the witch's insistence that Satan is all around her and easily seen, the knight, alas, sees nothing. Finally, in the closing moments of the film, as Death presents himself to the knight, the squire, the blacksmith, and their accompanying women, the knight tries one final time to beseech God. However, the squire asserts that "In that darkness where you reside, where we probably all reside, you'll find no one that listens to your complaint or is moved by your suffering." In addition to showing the knight's abandonment issue, the squire implies Sartre's final feeling, despair, in that the squire understands that, in the absence of God, man must "limit" himself "to reckoning only with those things that depend of (his) will" and not that of others.

    Existentialism and the Seventh Seal I was surprised to learn that I had actually seen this movie before, though I was drunk of the Raven's wine and its deeper vision escaped me. The Seventh Seal is the search for meaning in the absence of a present and firm God and aligns to Jean Paul Sartre's ideal of atheistic existentialism. How does the knight know Death is Death? Death appears as a man in black's cloak. He says he is Death, but offers no proof of his power. The Knight seems to intrinsically know the mask of Death. Does the Knight wish to see Death and thus calls Death to him? To the outsider, the meeting is unknowable, but to the Knight the meeting is with Death. This suggests and with accordance to Sartre that visions are defined by what they are decided to be. The acrobat sees a vision of a woman with child. He takes her and him to be the Virgin May and the Babe of God. I did not make this interpretation, and saw only the visual of the acrobat's vision. Is it possible to interpret our own visions impartially? If a man comes in black calling himself Death, should I operate under the principle he is Death or not Death. I can play the game under the pretense Death is Death, but I should always remain skeptical of Death being not Death. In this way, I can be part of reality and also I can be the third party viewer who provides a source of skepticism. Death- "Will you ever stop asking questions? But you get no answer." Death is neither God nor the Devil. The Knight recognizes Death is the emptiness left by the absence of God, yet he is compelled to probe emptiness. What does the Knight learn from his probing? He learns terror. He learns his meaning is found with his waiting wife. Sartre would be proud of the Knight, who pushes even through emptiness to find meaning in what was already there. He learns to treasure and become his memories, joy from strawberries and milk. Is this the fate of man, to believe in visions and signs of God founded in our own minds but sublimated unto the world? The Black Plague was caused by man's fear and elimination of cats that did not eat the rats of decay. God must be a cat.

    This film is a deep and dynamic contemplation on death, god, and purpose. The story follows Jons and Jof as they return home from warring through the crusades after 10 years away. On their return Johns encounters Death, who he challenges to a game of chess, wagering his life for the win. Throughout the story characters contemplate what is the meaning of life in all of the suffering that is going on around them. Jons, as does the character Socrates, wonders what is the true meaning of his existence. He questions the purpose of the war he has fought. He questions why the God he has fought for will not speak to him and show him meaning. This movie was a truly memorable experience and anyone with any interest in philosophy should check it out.

    I will keep this as short as possible - Boring. Do now waste your time watching this rubbish. Seriously, I can not think of one good thing about this movie.I am not going to waste time by going through the details of this movie which where bad because I would be here all day. I'll tell you why people rate this thrash though, this movie is yet another case of 'The Emperors new clothing', it makes the movie Citizen Kane look entertaining or somewhat interesting in comparison. At least Citizen Kane used (at the time) innovating cinematography. This has zilch going for it. i bet you people only say they rate it because they are afraid of looking like philistines by the snobs, who I doubt even watched the full 90 minutes - And I don't blame them. DO NOT WATCH.

    I have stated many times that Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite film makers of all time. I, like many others, see him as a visionary, a shining example of an amazing film maker. His films are like no other's, there are layers beyond layers that can only hope to be unraveled in his works. Few film makers have achieved such artistic success as Bergman and few ever will. Though his films may share similar themes, they all bear their own drastically defining characteristics. "The Seventh Seal" is a film I first saw nearly a year ago and did not fully appreciate until I revisited it more recently. Bear in mind that this like most or Bergman's films require multiple viewings to even begin a discussion. In the first scenes of the film we see a vast seashore and a knight awaking on it. He is approached by a mysterious hooded figure that reveals himself as Death. The knight, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from the Crusades to a plague infested Sweden. Death claims that he has come for him and that his time in the world of the living is up. In order to hinder Death's deed, Antonius proposes a game of chess between the two. If he is to win the game, Death will set him free. The film also follows a wide variety of other character's that towards the end come together. When reviewing an Ingmar Bergman film, I don't care to greatly indulge on the plot, especially with this film, as I fear it will take away from the film's charm. Ingmar Begman seems to be very fascinated with God and faith. This is a film that shows you the burden faith can bring. I believe that Bergman directed this film by channeling his own inner struggles into his art, like many great artists have done and still do. The main character of the film is on the verge of loosing his faith in God, he wants to believe, but he does not see any proof backing God's existence. This is something most people have struggled with during the course of their live and I believe Bergman did as well. You don't see film's like these nowadays and I know everyone has been saying this over and over again, but "The Seventh Seal" possesses a type of beauty that could only be captured by someone like Ingmar Bergman and it is a rare occasion that someone like him comes around. The lighting and shadows in this film add to the already beautiful black and white visuals. In my opinion the most beautiful scenes visually have to be the opening scene and the ending scenes (not going to spoil it) To take in the beauty and to somewhat understand "The Seventh Seal" you have to watch it multiple times. The visuals, music and the overall ambiance of the film added to the already outright fantastic story and powerful underlying themes creates a beautifully eery film. I have praised Ingmar Bergman and his films enough already, all I have to say it "The Seventh Seal" is a masterpiece and an untouchable classic.

    A man seeks answers about life, death, and the existence of God as he plays chess against the Grim Reaper during the Black Plague. That fooled me. The movie is not that interesting. Some people might analyze each and every scene and dialog and come up with their own interpretations of what Bergman wanted to say. Jacksh*t. Now usually i love such kind of movies. I am not a fan of commercial craps like fast and furious or the recent man of steel. I am a sucker for good stories, script and character development but this movie had nothing.The dialogs were so darn lame a 14 y.o. could have written them. The pace was so slow the movie felt more like 150 minutes instead of its 90 minute run time. This is the second Bergman film i have viewed, the first being Persona which i also felt was overrated but at least kept me interested and concerned with it all along. I am sure this guy knew his movies but one doesn't make movies only for their fans but for a wider audience. How could you call this guy an artist. All he ever does is try to make a deep engrossing movie that asks its viewers certain important questions about life and the idea of a god but what he ends up making is a sh*t sandwich that should never be viewed under any circumstances. 1/10

    Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, "The Seventh Seal" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. Taking its title from the Book of Revelation, "The Seventh Seal" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: "I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me," he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented. Bergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (&Aring;ke Fridell), squire J&ouml;ns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.

    Plot: A Knight, Antonius Block, returns to his homeland Sweden with his squire (Jons), from a ten year long Crusade, only to find his country in the clutches of infamous plague--the Black Death (mid-1300s). On his journey home, he encounters the physical form of death itself (Bengt Ekerot) and engages him in an intriguing game of Chess to actually buy some time for some purpose of his. In this Swedish masterpiece the director, very artistically, collaborates tragic events of Europe caused by a widespread plague (bubonic plague-symptoms include a Swollen gland) with the "Book Of Revelation" primarily focusing on Apocalypse. The main characters have been chosen such that they represent various personalities and mental states of the sufferers. For example, the knight represents a delusional person who isn't sure if his Crusade had any point to it, his squire--a good man at heart--wonders where is God in this hour of need, the priest represents a power hungry man who instills fear in the society for his own benefit. The young actor couple and their child represent a God loving family who will survive the calamity. The whole country is suffering and there is confusion everywhere. People are punishing themselves to achieve absolution. Among all this hardship there still are people who are jolly and enjoying their lives to the hilt. Some of them are realizing their true selves. Even the Knight finds a purpose to his life and saves the young family from the clutches of Death. He eventually, with his wife and followers, dances with the Death. This 'dance' has become an iconic image of world cinema. A definite must watch. 8.5/10

    The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's take on religion and death. The film follows the story of Antonius Block, a knight who is returning home after having gone through the crusades. The country is now dominated by the Black Death and he ends up facing the grim reaper himself during his trip. The scenes between both of these characters are often intriguing, chilling and even comical. Block constantly questions the meaning of life and tries to accept his fatal destiny. The scenes with the witch character were very moving and illustrated how merciless and radical people could be at that period. I have one gripe with the film which is basically the acting. While most of the cast provides great performances (Especially Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot), I found some of the secondary characters like Jof, Mia and Blacksmith Plog annoying at times. Bergman uses a lot of theatricality here and I felt that there were scenes involving these folks, which were too repetitive and a bit dull. However, the overall result is mesmerizing and a definite must-see for those who are fans of Bergman's work or everyone who just appreciates a quality introspective film.

Plog the Blacksmith (&Aring;ke Fridell), squire J&ouml;ns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.

    Plot: A Knight, Antonius Block, returns to his homeland Sweden with his squire (Jons), from a ten year long Crusade, only to find his country in the clutches of infamous plague--the Black Death (mid-1300s). On his journey home, he encounters the physical form of death itself (Bengt Ekerot) and engages him in an intriguing game of Chess to actually buy some time for some purpose of his. In this Swedish masterpiece the director, very artistically, collaborates tragic events of Europe caused by a widespread plague (bubonic plague-symptoms include a Swollen gland) with the "Book Of Revelation" primarily focusing on Apocalypse. The main characters have been chosen such that they represent various personalities and mental states of the sufferers. For example, the knight represents a delusional person who isn't sure if his Crusade had any point to it, his squire--a good man at heart--wonders where is God in this hour of need, the priest represents a power hungry man who instills fear in the society for his own benefit. The young actor couple and their child represent a God loving family who will survive the calamity. The whole country is suffering and there is confusion everywhere. People are punishing themselves to achieve absolution. Among all this hardship there still are people who are jolly and enjoying their lives to the hilt. Some of them are realizing their true selves. Even the Knight finds a purpose to his life and saves the young family from the clutches of Death. He eventually, with his wife and followers, dances with the Death. This 'dance' has become an iconic image of world cinema. A definite must watch. 8.5/10

    The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's take on religion and death. The film follows the story of Antonius Block, a knight who is returning home after having gone through the crusades. The country is now dominated by the Black Death and he ends up facing the grim reaper himself during his trip. The scenes between both of these characters are often intriguing, chilling and even comical. Block constantly questions the meaning of life and tries to accept his fatal destiny. The scenes with the witch character were very moving and illustrated how merciless and radical people could be at that period. I have one gripe with the film which is basically the acting. While most of the cast provides great performances (Especially Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot), I found some of the secondary characters like Jof, Mia and Blacksmith Plog annoying at times. Bergman uses a lot of theatricality here and I felt that there were scenes involving these folks, which were too repetitive and a bit dull. However, the overall result is mesmerizing and a definite must-see for those who are fans of Bergman's work or everyone who just appreciates a quality introspective film.

    The events and themes of Ingar Bergman's classic The Seventh Seal show numerous examples of existentialism. Throughout the film, characters blame occurrences such as the black plague on God, helplessly resorting to the idea that they have no individual control over their destinies. Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who "hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles." The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choicesas is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival.

    Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal follows the final days of a knight, and an accompanying band of his squire, actors, and a blacksmith, as he plays chess with Death, his life hanging in the balance. Ominous and foreboding, Bergman steeps The Seventh Seal with existentialist philosophy akin to Sartre's atheist existentialism found in "Existentialism is a Humanism." Much of the knight's journey through the film mirrors Sartre's atheistic existentialist notions of anguish, despair, and abandonment. Sartre, unlike others, states that the lack of a God is not simply met with mere acceptance; rather, the person experiences these three feelings. The knight exhibits the anguish, which Sartre suggests is a consequence of one wondering "What would happen if everyone did what I am doing?," early in the film when he ponders "Through my indifference for people, I've been placed outside of their society." The abandonment, similarly, is shown through the knight throughout the film. Having realized his inability to find God, the knight requests to meet Satan, who the knight believes "He if anyone" must know God, via an alleged witch waiting for execution. Despite the witch's insistence that Satan is all around her and easily seen, the knight, alas, sees nothing. Finally, in the closing moments of the film, as Death presents himself to the knight, the squire, the blacksmith, and their accompanying women, the knight tries one final time to beseech God. However, the squire asserts that "In that darkness where you reside, where we probably all reside, you'll find no one that listens to your complaint or is moved by your suffering." In addition to showing the knight's abandonment issue, the squire implies Sartre's final feeling, despair, in that the squire understands that, in the absence of God, man must "limit" himself "to reckoning only with those things that depend of (his) will" and not that of others.

    Existentialism and the Seventh Seal I was surprised to learn that I had actually seen this movie before, though I was drunk of the Raven's wine and its deeper vision escaped me. The Seventh Seal is the search for meaning in the absence of a present and firm God and aligns to Jean Paul Sartre's ideal of atheistic existentialism. How does the knight know Death is Death? Death appears as a man in black's cloak. He says he is Death, but offers no proof of his power. The Knight seems to intrinsically know the mask of Death. Does the Knight wish to see Death and thus calls Death to him? To the outsider, the meeting is unknowable, but to the Knight the meeting is with Death. This suggests and with accordance to Sartre that visions are defined by what they are decided to be. The acrobat sees a vision of a woman with child. He takes her and him to be the Virgin May and the Babe of God. I did not make this interpretation, and saw only the visual of the acrobat's vision. Is it possible to interpret our own visions impartially? If a man comes in black calling himself Death, should I operate under the principle he is Death or not Death. I can play the game under the pretense Death is Death, but I should always remain skeptical of Death being not Death. In this way, I can be part of reality and also I can be the third party viewer who provides a source of skepticism. Death- "Will you ever stop asking questions? But you get no answer." Death is neither God nor the Devil. The Knight recognizes Death is the emptiness left by the absence of God, yet he is compelled to probe emptiness. What does the Knight learn from his probing? He learns terror. He learns his meaning is found with his waiting wife. Sartre would be proud of the Knight, who pushes even through emptiness to find meaning in what was already there. He learns to treasure and become his memories, joy from strawberries and milk. Is this the fate of man, to believe in visions and signs of God founded in our own minds but sublimated unto the world? The Black Plague was caused by man's fear and elimination of cats that did not eat the rats of decay. God must be a cat.

    This film is a deep and dynamic contemplation on death, god, and purpose. The story follows Jons and Jof as they return home from warring through the crusades after 10 years away. On their return Johns encounters Death, who he challenges to a game of chess, wagering his life for the win. Throughout the story characters contemplate what is the meaning of life in all of the suffering that is going on around them. Jons, as does the character Socrates, wonders what is the true meaning of his existence. He questions the purpose of the war he has fought. He questions why the God he has fought for will not speak to him and show him meaning. This movie was a truly memorable experience and anyone with any interest in philosophy should check it out.

Seriously, I can not think of one good thing about this movie.I am not going to waste time by going through the details of this movie which where bad because I would be here all day. I'll tell you why people rate this thrash though, this movie is yet another case of 'The Emperors new clothing', it makes the movie Citizen Kane look entertaining or somewhat interesting in comparison. At least Citizen Kane used (at the time) innovating cinematography. This has zilch going for it. i bet you people only say they rate it because they are afraid of looking like philistines by the snobs, who I doubt even watched the full 90 minutes - And I don't blame them. DO NOT WATCH.

    I have stated many times that Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite film makers of all time. I, like many others, see him as a visionary, a shining example of an amazing film maker. His films are like no other's, there are layers beyond layers that can only hope to be unraveled in his works. Few film makers have achieved such artistic success as Bergman and few ever will. Though his films may share similar themes, they all bear their own drastically defining characteristics. "The Seventh Seal" is a film I first saw nearly a year ago and did not fully appreciate until I revisited it more recently. Bear in mind that this like most or Bergman's films require multiple viewings to even begin a discussion. In the first scenes of the film we see a vast seashore and a knight awaking on it. He is approached by a mysterious hooded figure that reveals himself as Death. The knight, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from the Crusades to a plague infested Sweden. Death claims that he has come for him and that his time in the world of the living is up. In order to hinder Death's deed, Antonius proposes a game of chess between the two. If he is to win the game, Death will set him free. The film also follows a wide variety of other character's that towards the end come together. When reviewing an Ingmar Bergman film, I don't care to greatly indulge on the plot, especially with this film, as I fear it will take away from the film's charm. Ingmar Begman seems to be very fascinated with God and faith. This is a film that shows you the burden faith can bring. I believe that Bergman directed this film by channeling his own inner struggles into his art, like many great artists have done and still do. The main character of the film is on the verge of loosing his faith in God, he wants to believe, but he does not see any proof backing God's existence. This is something most people have struggled with during the course of their live and I believe Bergman did as well. You don't see film's like these nowadays and I know everyone has been saying this over and over again, but "The Seventh Seal" possesses a type of beauty that could only be captured by someone like Ingmar Bergman and it is a rare occasion that someone like him comes around. The lighting and shadows in this film add to the already beautiful black and white visuals. In my opinion the most beautiful scenes visually have to be the opening scene and the ending scenes (not going to spoil it) To take in the beauty and to somewhat understand "The Seventh Seal" you have to watch it multiple times. The visuals, music and the overall ambiance of the film added to the already outright fantastic story and powerful underlying themes creates a beautifully eery film. I have praised Ingmar Bergman and his films enough already, all I have to say it "The Seventh Seal" is a masterpiece and an untouchable classic.

    A man seeks answers about life, death, and the existence of God as he plays chess against the Grim Reaper during the Black Plague. That fooled me. The movie is not that interesting. Some people might analyze each and every scene and dialog and come up with their own interpretations of what Bergman wanted to say. Jacksh*t. Now usually i love such kind of movies. I am not a fan of commercial craps like fast and furious or the recent man of steel. I am a sucker for good stories, script and character development but this movie had nothing.The dialogs were so darn lame a 14 y.o. could have written them. The pace was so slow the movie felt more like 150 minutes instead of its 90 minute run time. This is the second Bergman film i have viewed, the first being Persona which i also felt was overrated but at least kept me interested and concerned with it all along. I am sure this guy knew his movies but one doesn't make movies only for their fans but for a wider audience. How could you call this guy an artist. All he ever does is try to make a deep engrossing movie that asks its viewers certain important questions about life and the idea of a god but what he ends up making is a sh*t sandwich that should never be viewed under any circumstances. 1/10

    Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, "The Seventh Seal" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. Taking its title from the Book of Revelation, "The Seventh Seal" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: "I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me," he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented. Bergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (&Aring;ke Fridell), squire J&ouml;ns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.

This is something most people have struggled with during the course of their live and I believe Bergman did as well. You don't see film's like these nowadays and I know everyone has been saying this over and over again, but "The Seventh Seal" possesses a type of beauty that could only be captured by someone like Ingmar Bergman and it is a rare occasion that someone like him comes around. The lighting and shadows in this film add to the already beautiful black and white visuals. In my opinion the most beautiful scenes visually have to be the opening scene and the ending scenes (not going to spoil it) To take in the beauty and to somewhat understand "The Seventh Seal" you have to watch it multiple times. The visuals, music and the overall ambiance of the film added to the already outright fantastic story and powerful underlying themes creates a beautifully eery film. I have praised Ingmar Bergman and his films enough already, all I have to say it "The Seventh Seal" is a masterpiece and an untouchable classic.

    A man seeks answers about life, death, and the existence of God as he plays chess against the Grim Reaper during the Black Plague. That fooled me. The movie is not that interesting. Some people might analyze each and every scene and dialog and come up with their own interpretations of what Bergman wanted to say. Jacksh*t. Now usually i love such kind of movies. I am not a fan of commercial craps like fast and furious or the recent man of steel. I am a sucker for good stories, script and character development but this movie had nothing.The dialogs were so darn lame a 14 y.o. could have written them. The pace was so slow the movie felt more like 150 minutes instead of its 90 minute run time. This is the second Bergman film i have viewed, the first being Persona which i also felt was overrated but at least kept me interested and concerned with it all along. I am sure this guy knew his movies but one doesn't make movies only for their fans but for a wider audience. How could you call this guy an artist. All he ever does is try to make a deep engrossing movie that asks its viewers certain important questions about life and the idea of a god but what he ends up making is a sh*t sandwich that should never be viewed under any circumstances. 1/10

    Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, "The Seventh Seal" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. Taking its title from the Book of Revelation, "The Seventh Seal" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: "I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me," he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented. Bergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (&Aring;ke Fridell), squire J&ouml;ns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.

    Plot: A Knight, Antonius Block, returns to his homeland Sweden with his squire (Jons), from a ten year long Crusade, only to find his country in the clutches of infamous plague--the Black Death (mid-1300s). On his journey home, he encounters the physical form of death itself (Bengt Ekerot) and engages him in an intriguing game of Chess to actually buy some time for some purpose of his. In this Swedish masterpiece the director, very artistically, collaborates tragic events of Europe caused by a widespread plague (bubonic plague-symptoms include a Swollen gland) with the "Book Of Revelation" primarily focusing on Apocalypse. The main characters have been chosen such that they represent various personalities and mental states of the sufferers. For example, the knight represents a delusional person who isn't sure if his Crusade had any point to it, his squire--a good man at heart--wonders where is God in this hour of need, the priest represents a power hungry man who instills fear in the society for his own benefit. The young actor couple and their child represent a God loving family who will survive the calamity. The whole country is suffering and there is confusion everywhere. People are punishing themselves to achieve absolution. Among all this hardship there still are people who are jolly and enjoying their lives to the hilt. Some of them are realizing their true selves. Even the Knight finds a purpose to his life and saves the young family from the clutches of Death. He eventually, with his wife and followers, dances with the Death. This 'dance' has become an iconic image of world cinema. A definite must watch. 8.5/10

    The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's take on religion and death. The film follows the story of Antonius Block, a knight who is returning home after having gone through the crusades. The country is now dominated by the Black Death and he ends up facing the grim reaper himself during his trip. The scenes between both of these characters are often intriguing, chilling and even comical. Block constantly questions the meaning of life and tries to accept his fatal destiny. The scenes with the witch character were very moving and illustrated how merciless and radical people could be at that period. I have one gripe with the film which is basically the acting. While most of the cast provides great performances (Especially Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot), I found some of the secondary characters like Jof, Mia and Blacksmith Plog annoying at times. Bergman uses a lot of theatricality here and I felt that there were scenes involving these folks, which were too repetitive and a bit dull. However, the overall result is mesmerizing and a definite must-see for those who are fans of Bergman's work or everyone who just appreciates a quality introspective film.

    The events and themes of Ingar Bergman's classic The Seventh Seal show numerous examples of existentialism. Throughout the film, characters blame occurrences such as the black plague on God, helplessly resorting to the idea that they have no individual control over their destinies. Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who "hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles." The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choicesas is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival.

    Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal follows the final days of a knight, and an accompanying band of his squire, actors, and a blacksmith, as he plays chess with Death, his life hanging in the balance. Ominous and foreboding, Bergman steeps The Seventh Seal with existentialist philosophy akin to Sartre's atheist existentialism found in "Existentialism is a Humanism." Much of the knight's journey through the film mirrors Sartre's atheistic existentialist notions of anguish, despair, and abandonment. Sartre, unlike others, states that the lack of a God is not simply met with mere acceptance; rather, the person experiences these three feelings. The knight exhibits the anguish, which Sartre suggests is a consequence of one wondering "What would happen if everyone did what I am doing?," early in the film when he ponders "Through my indifference for people, I've been placed outside of their society." The abandonment, similarly, is shown through the knight throughout the film. Having realized his inability to find God, the knight requests to meet Satan, who the knight believes "He if anyone" must know God, via an alleged witch waiting for execution. Despite the witch's insistence that Satan is all around her and easily seen, the knight, alas, sees nothing. Finally, in the closing moments of the film, as Death presents himself to the knight, the squire, the blacksmith, and their accompanying women, the knight tries one final time to beseech God. However, the squire asserts that "In that darkness where you reside, where we probably all reside, you'll find no one that listens to your complaint or is moved by your suffering." In addition to showing the knight's abandonment issue, the squire implies Sartre's final feeling, despair, in that the squire understands that, in the absence of God, man must "limit" himself "to reckoning only with those things that depend of (his) will" and not that of others.

    Existentialism and the Seventh Seal I was surprised to learn that I had actually seen this movie before, though I was drunk of the Raven's wine and its deeper vision escaped me. The Seventh Seal is the search for meaning in the absence of a present and firm God and aligns to Jean Paul Sartre's ideal of atheistic existentialism. How does the knight know Death is Death? Death appears as a man in black's cloak. He says he is Death, but offers no proof of his power. The Knight seems to intrinsically know the mask of Death. Does the Knight wish to see Death and thus calls Death to him? To the outsider, the meeting is unknowable, but to the Knight the meeting is with Death. This suggests and with accordance to Sartre that visions are defined by what they are decided to be. The acrobat sees a vision of a woman with child. He takes her and him to be the Virgin May and the Babe of God. I did not make this interpretation, and saw only the visual of the acrobat's vision. Is it possible to interpret our own visions impartially? If a man comes in black calling himself Death, should I operate under the principle he is Death or not Death. I can play the game under the pretense Death is Death, but I should always remain skeptical of Death being not Death. In this way, I can be part of reality and also I can be the third party viewer who provides a source of skepticism. Death- "Will you ever stop asking questions? But you get no answer." Death is neither God nor the Devil. The Knight recognizes Death is the emptiness left by the absence of God, yet he is compelled to probe emptiness. What does the Knight learn from his probing? He learns terror. He learns his meaning is found with his waiting wife. Sartre would be proud of the Knight, who pushes even through emptiness to find meaning in what was already there. He learns to treasure and become his memories, joy from strawberries and milk. Is this the fate of man, to believe in visions and signs of God founded in our own minds but sublimated unto the world? The Black Plague was caused by man's fear and elimination of cats that did not eat the rats of decay. God must be a cat.

    This film is a deep and dynamic contemplation on death, god, and purpose. The story follows Jons and Jof as they return home from warring through the crusades after 10 years away. On their return Johns encounters Death, who he challenges to a game of chess, wagering his life for the win. Throughout the story characters contemplate what is the meaning of life in all of the suffering that is going on around them. Jons, as does the character Socrates, wonders what is the true meaning of his existence. He questions the purpose of the war he has fought. He questions why the God he has fought for will not speak to him and show him meaning. This movie was a truly memorable experience and anyone with any interest in philosophy should check it out.

    I will keep this as short as possible - Boring. Do now waste your time watching this rubbish. Seriously, I can not think of one good thing about this movie.I am not going to waste time by going through the details of this movie which where bad because I would be here all day. I'll tell you why people rate this thrash though, this movie is yet another case of 'The Emperors new clothing', it makes the movie Citizen Kane look entertaining or somewhat interesting in comparison. At least Citizen Kane used (at the time) innovating cinematography. This has zilch going for it. i bet you people only say they rate it because they are afraid of looking like philistines by the snobs, who I doubt even watched the full 90 minutes - And I don't blame them. DO NOT WATCH.

    I have stated many times that Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite film makers of all time. I, like many others, see him as a visionary, a shining example of an amazing film maker. His films are like no other's, there are layers beyond layers that can only hope to be unraveled in his works. Few film makers have achieved such artistic success as Bergman and few ever will. Though his films may share similar themes, they all bear their own drastically defining characteristics. "The Seventh Seal" is a film I first saw nearly a year ago and did not fully appreciate until I revisited it more recently. Bear in mind that this like most or Bergman's films require multiple viewings to even begin a discussion. In the first scenes of the film we see a vast seashore and a knight awaking on it. He is approached by a mysterious hooded figure that reveals himself as Death. The knight, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from the Crusades to a plague infested Sweden. Death claims that he has come for him and that his time in the world of the living is up. In order to hinder Death's deed, Antonius proposes a game of chess between the two. If he is to win the game, Death will set him free. The film also follows a wide variety of other character's that towards the end come together. When reviewing an Ingmar Bergman film, I don't care to greatly indulge on the plot, especially with this film, as I fear it will take away from the film's charm. Ingmar Begman seems to be very fascinated with God and faith. This is a film that shows you the burden faith can bring. I believe that Bergman directed this film by channeling his own inner struggles into his art, like many great artists have done and still do. The main character of the film is on the verge of loosing his faith in God, he wants to believe, but he does not see any proof backing God's existence. This is something most people have struggled with during the course of their live and I believe Bergman did as well. You don't see film's like these nowadays and I know everyone has been saying this over and over again, but "The Seventh Seal" possesses a type of beauty that could only be captured by someone like Ingmar Bergman and it is a rare occasion that someone like him comes around. The lighting and shadows in this film add to the already beautiful black and white visuals. In my opinion the most beautiful scenes visually have to be the opening scene and the ending scenes (not going to spoil it) To take in the beauty and to somewhat understand "The Seventh Seal" you have to watch it multiple times. The visuals, music and the overall ambiance of the film added to the already outright fantastic story and powerful underlying themes creates a beautifully eery film. I have praised Ingmar Bergman and his films enough already, all I have to say it "The Seventh Seal" is a masterpiece and an untouchable classic.

    This film is a deep and dynamic contemplation on death, god, and purpose. The story follows Jons and Jof as they return home from warring through the crusades after 10 years away. On their return Johns encounters Death, who he challenges to a game of chess, wagering his life for the win. Throughout the story characters contemplate what is the meaning of life in all of the suffering that is going on around them. Jons, as does the character Socrates, wonders what is the true meaning of his existence. He questions the purpose of the war he has fought. He questions why the God he has fought for will not speak to him and show him meaning. This movie was a truly memorable experience and anyone with any interest in philosophy should check it out.

    I will keep this as short as possible - Boring. Do now waste your time watching this rubbish. Seriously, I can not think of one good thing about this movie.I am not going to waste time by going through the details of this movie which where bad because I would be here all day. I'll tell you why people rate this thrash though, this movie is yet another case of 'The Emperors new clothing', it makes the movie Citizen Kane look entertaining or somewhat interesting in comparison. At least Citizen Kane used (at the time) innovating cinematography. This has zilch going for it. i bet you people only say they rate it because they are afraid of looking like philistines by the snobs, who I doubt even watched the full 90 minutes - And I don't blame them. DO NOT WATCH.

    I have stated many times that Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite film makers of all time. I, like many others, see him as a visionary, a shining example of an amazing film maker. His films are like no other's, there are layers beyond layers that can only hope to be unraveled in his works. Few film makers have achieved such artistic success as Bergman and few ever will. Though his films may share similar themes, they all bear their own drastically defining characteristics. "The Seventh Seal" is a film I first saw nearly a year ago and did not fully appreciate until I revisited it more recently. Bear in mind that this like most or Bergman's films require multiple viewings to even begin a discussion. In the first scenes of the film we see a vast seashore and a knight awaking on it. He is approached by a mysterious hooded figure that reveals himself as Death. The knight, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from the Crusades to a plague infested Sweden. Death claims that he has come for him and that his time in the world of the living is up. In order to hinder Death's deed, Antonius proposes a game of chess between the two. If he is to win the game, Death will set him free. The film also follows a wide variety of other character's that towards the end come together. When reviewing an Ingmar Bergman film, I don't care to greatly indulge on the plot, especially with this film, as I fear it will take away from the film's charm. Ingmar Begman seems to be very fascinated with God and faith. This is a film that shows you the burden faith can bring. I believe that Bergman directed this film by channeling his own inner struggles into his art, like many great artists have done and still do. The main character of the film is on the verge of loosing his faith in God, he wants to believe, but he does not see any proof backing God's existence. This is something most people have struggled with during the course of their live and I believe Bergman did as well. You don't see film's like these nowadays and I know everyone has been saying this over and over again, but "The Seventh Seal" possesses a type of beauty that could only be captured by someone like Ingmar Bergman and it is a rare occasion that someone like him comes around. The lighting and shadows in this film add to the already beautiful black and white visuals. In my opinion the most beautiful scenes visually have to be the opening scene and the ending scenes (not going to spoil it) To take in the beauty and to somewhat understand "The Seventh Seal" you have to watch it multiple times. The visuals, music and the overall ambiance of the film added to the already outright fantastic story and powerful underlying themes creates a beautifully eery film. I have praised Ingmar Bergman and his films enough already, all I have to say it "The Seventh Seal" is a masterpiece and an untouchable classic.

    A man seeks answers about life, death, and the existence of God as he plays chess against the Grim Reaper during the Black Plague. That fooled me. The movie is not that interesting. Some people might analyze each and every scene and dialog and come up with their own interpretations of what Bergman wanted to say. Jacksh*t. Now usually i love such kind of movies. I am not a fan of commercial craps like fast and furious or the recent man of steel. I am a sucker for good stories, script and character development but this movie had nothing.The dialogs were so darn lame a 14 y.o. could have written them. The pace was so slow the movie felt more like 150 minutes instead of its 90 minute run time. This is the second Bergman film i have viewed, the first being Persona which i also felt was overrated but at least kept me interested and concerned with it all along. I am sure this guy knew his movies but one doesn't make movies only for their fans but for a wider audience. How could you call this guy an artist. All he ever does is try to make a deep engrossing movie that asks its viewers certain important questions about life and the idea of a god but what he ends up making is a sh*t sandwich that should never be viewed under any circumstances. 1/10

    Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, "The Seventh Seal" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. Taking its title from the Book of Revelation, "The Seventh Seal" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: "I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me," he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented. Bergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (&Aring;ke Fridell), squire J&ouml;ns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.

    Plot: A Knight, Antonius Block, returns to his homeland Sweden with his squire (Jons), from a ten year long Crusade, only to find his country in the clutches of infamous plague--the Black Death (mid-1300s). On his journey home, he encounters the physical form of death itself (Bengt Ekerot) and engages him in an intriguing game of Chess to actually buy some time for some purpose of his. In this Swedish masterpiece the director, very artistically, collaborates tragic events of Europe caused by a widespread plague (bubonic plague-symptoms include a Swollen gland) with the "Book Of Revelation" primarily focusing on Apocalypse. The main characters have been chosen such that they represent various personalities and mental states of the sufferers. For example, the knight represents a delusional person who isn't sure if his Crusade had any point to it, his squire--a good man at heart--wonders where is God in this hour of need, the priest represents a power hungry man who instills fear in the society for his own benefit. The young actor couple and their child represent a God loving family who will survive the calamity. The whole country is suffering and there is confusion everywhere. People are punishing themselves to achieve absolution. Among all this hardship there still are people who are jolly and enjoying their lives to the hilt. Some of them are realizing their true selves. Even the Knight finds a purpose to his life and saves the young family from the clutches of Death. He eventually, with his wife and followers, dances with the Death. This 'dance' has become an iconic image of world cinema. A definite must watch. 8.5/10

    The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's take on religion and death. The film follows the story of Antonius Block, a knight who is returning home after having gone through the crusades. The country is now dominated by the Black Death and he ends up facing the grim reaper himself during his trip. The scenes between both of these characters are often intriguing, chilling and even comical. Block constantly questions the meaning of life and tries to accept his fatal destiny. The scenes with the witch character were very moving and illustrated how merciless and radical people could be at that period. I have one gripe with the film which is basically the acting. While most of the cast provides great performances (Especially Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot), I found some of the secondary characters like Jof, Mia and Blacksmith Plog annoying at times. Bergman uses a lot of theatricality here and I felt that there were scenes involving these folks, which were too repetitive and a bit dull. However, the overall result is mesmerizing and a definite must-see for those who are fans of Bergman's work or everyone who just appreciates a quality introspective film.

    The events and themes of Ingar Bergman's classic The Seventh Seal show numerous examples of existentialism. Throughout the film, characters blame occurrences such as the black plague on God, helplessly resorting to the idea that they have no individual control over their destinies. Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who "hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles." The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choicesas is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival.

    Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal follows the final days of a knight, and an accompanying band of his squire, actors, and a blacksmith, as he plays chess with Death, his life hanging in the balance. Ominous and foreboding, Bergman steeps The Seventh Seal with existentialist philosophy akin to Sartre's atheist existentialism found in "Existentialism is a Humanism." Much of the knight's journey through the film mirrors Sartre's atheistic existentialist notions of anguish, despair, and abandonment. Sartre, unlike others, states that the lack of a God is not simply met with mere acceptance; rather, the person experiences these three feelings. The knight exhibits the anguish, which Sartre suggests is a consequence of one wondering "What would happen if everyone did what I am doing?," early in the film when he ponders "Through my indifference for people, I've been placed outside of their society." The abandonment, similarly, is shown through the knight throughout the film. Having realized his inability to find God, the knight requests to meet Satan, who the knight believes "He if anyone" must know God, via an alleged witch waiting for execution. Despite the witch's insistence that Satan is all around her and easily seen, the knight, alas, sees nothing. Finally, in the closing moments of the film, as Death presents himself to the knight, the squire, the blacksmith, and their accompanying women, the knight tries one final time to beseech God. However, the squire asserts that "In that darkness where you reside, where we probably all reside, you'll find no one that listens to your complaint or is moved by your suffering." In addition to showing the knight's abandonment issue, the squire implies Sartre's final feeling, despair, in that the squire understands that, in the absence of God, man must "limit" himself "to reckoning only with those things that depend of (his) will" and not that of others.

    Existentialism and the Seventh Seal I was surprised to learn that I had actually seen this movie before, though I was drunk of the Raven's wine and its deeper vision escaped me. The Seventh Seal is the search for meaning in the absence of a present and firm God and aligns to Jean Paul Sartre's ideal of atheistic existentialism. How does the knight know Death is Death? Death appears as a man in black's cloak. He says he is Death, but offers no proof of his power. The Knight seems to intrinsically know the mask of Death. Does the Knight wish to see Death and thus calls Death to him? To the outsider, the meeting is unknowable, but to the Knight the meeting is with Death. This suggests and with accordance to Sartre that visions are defined by what they are decided to be. The acrobat sees a vision of a woman with child. He takes her and him to be the Virgin May and the Babe of God. I did not make this interpretation, and saw only the visual of the acrobat's vision. Is it possible to interpret our own visions impartially? If a man comes in black calling himself Death, should I operate under the principle he is Death or not Death. I can play the game under the pretense Death is Death, but I should always remain skeptical of Death being not Death. In this way, I can be part of reality and also I can be the third party viewer who provides a source of skepticism. Death- "Will you ever stop asking questions? But you get no answer." Death is neither God nor the Devil. The Knight recognizes Death is the emptiness left by the absence of God, yet he is compelled to probe emptiness. What does the Knight learn from his probing? He learns terror. He learns his meaning is found with his waiting wife. Sartre would be proud of the Knight, who pushes even through emptiness to find meaning in what was already there. He learns to treasure and become his memories, joy from strawberries and milk. Is this the fate of man, to believe in visions and signs of God founded in our own minds but sublimated unto the world? The Black Plague was caused by man's fear and elimination of cats that did not eat the rats of decay. God must be a cat.

    Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal follows the final days of a knight, and an accompanying band of his squire, actors, and a blacksmith, as he plays chess with Death, his life hanging in the balance. Ominous and foreboding, Bergman steeps The Seventh Seal with existentialist philosophy akin to Sartre's atheist existentialism found in "Existentialism is a Humanism." Much of the knight's journey through the film mirrors Sartre's atheistic existentialist notions of anguish, despair, and abandonment. Sartre, unlike others, states that the lack of a God is not simply met with mere acceptance; rather, the person experiences these three feelings. The knight exhibits the anguish, which Sartre suggests is a consequence of one wondering "What would happen if everyone did what I am doing?," early in the film when he ponders "Through my indifference for people, I've been placed outside of their society." The abandonment, similarly, is shown through the knight throughout the film. Having realized his inability to find God, the knight requests to meet Satan, who the knight believes "He if anyone" must know God, via an alleged witch waiting for execution. Despite the witch's insistence that Satan is all around her and easily seen, the knight, alas, sees nothing. Finally, in the closing moments of the film, as Death presents himself to the knight, the squire, the blacksmith, and their accompanying women, the knight tries one final time to beseech God. However, the squire asserts that "In that darkness where you reside, where we probably all reside, you'll find no one that listens to your complaint or is moved by your suffering." In addition to showing the knight's abandonment issue, the squire implies Sartre's final feeling, despair, in that the squire understands that, in the absence of God, man must "limit" himself "to reckoning only with those things that depend of (his) will" and not that of others.

    Existentialism and the Seventh Seal I was surprised to learn that I had actually seen this movie before, though I was drunk of the Raven's wine and its deeper vision escaped me. The Seventh Seal is the search for meaning in the absence of a present and firm God and aligns to Jean Paul Sartre's ideal of atheistic existentialism. How does the knight know Death is Death? Death appears as a man in black's cloak. He says he is Death, but offers no proof of his power. The Knight seems to intrinsically know the mask of Death. Does the Knight wish to see Death and thus calls Death to him? To the outsider, the meeting is unknowable, but to the Knight the meeting is with Death. This suggests and with accordance to Sartre that visions are defined by what they are decided to be. The acrobat sees a vision of a woman with child. He takes her and him to be the Virgin May and the Babe of God. I did not make this interpretation, and saw only the visual of the acrobat's vision. Is it possible to interpret our own visions impartially? If a man comes in black calling himself Death, should I operate under the principle he is Death or not Death. I can play the game under the pretense Death is Death, but I should always remain skeptical of Death being not Death. In this way, I can be part of reality and also I can be the third party viewer who provides a source of skepticism. Death- "Will you ever stop asking questions? But you get no answer." Death is neither God nor the Devil. The Knight recognizes Death is the emptiness left by the absence of God, yet he is compelled to probe emptiness. What does the Knight learn from his probing? He learns terror. He learns his meaning is found with his waiting wife. Sartre would be proud of the Knight, who pushes even through emptiness to find meaning in what was already there. He learns to treasure and become his memories, joy from strawberries and milk. Is this the fate of man, to believe in visions and signs of God founded in our own minds but sublimated unto the world? The Black Plague was caused by man's fear and elimination of cats that did not eat the rats of decay. God must be a cat.

    This film is a deep and dynamic contemplation on death, god, and purpose. The story follows Jons and Jof as they return home from warring through the crusades after 10 years away. On their return Johns encounters Death, who he challenges to a game of chess, wagering his life for the win. Throughout the story characters contemplate what is the meaning of life in all of the suffering that is going on around them. Jons, as does the character Socrates, wonders what is the true meaning of his existence. He questions the purpose of the war he has fought. He questions why the God he has fought for will not speak to him and show him meaning. This movie was a truly memorable experience and anyone with any interest in philosophy should check it out.

    I will keep this as short as possible - Boring. Do now waste your time watching this rubbish. Seriously, I can not think of one good thing about this movie.I am not going to waste time by going through the details of this movie which where bad because I would be here all day. I'll tell you why people rate this thrash though, this movie is yet another case of 'The Emperors new clothing', it makes the movie Citizen Kane look entertaining or somewhat interesting in comparison. At least Citizen Kane used (at the time) innovating cinematography. This has zilch going for it. i bet you people only say they rate it because they are afraid of looking like philistines by the snobs, who I doubt even watched the full 90 minutes - And I don't blame them. DO NOT WATCH.

    I have stated many times that Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite film makers of all time. I, like many others, see him as a visionary, a shining example of an amazing film maker. His films are like no other's, there are layers beyond layers that can only hope to be unraveled in his works. Few film makers have achieved such artistic success as Bergman and few ever will. Though his films may share similar themes, they all bear their own drastically defining characteristics. "The Seventh Seal" is a film I first saw nearly a year ago and did not fully appreciate until I revisited it more recently. Bear in mind that this like most or Bergman's films require multiple viewings to even begin a discussion. In the first scenes of the film we see a vast seashore and a knight awaking on it. He is approached by a mysterious hooded figure that reveals himself as Death. The knight, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from the Crusades to a plague infested Sweden. Death claims that he has come for him and that his time in the world of the living is up. In order to hinder Death's deed, Antonius proposes a game of chess between the two. If he is to win the game, Death will set him free. The film also follows a wide variety of other character's that towards the end come together. When reviewing an Ingmar Bergman film, I don't care to greatly indulge on the plot, especially with this film, as I fear it will take away from the film's charm. Ingmar Begman seems to be very fascinated with God and faith. This is a film that shows you the burden faith can bring. I believe that Bergman directed this film by channeling his own inner struggles into his art, like many great artists have done and still do. The main character of the film is on the verge of loosing his faith in God, he wants to believe, but he does not see any proof backing God's existence. This is something most people have struggled with during the course of their live and I believe Bergman did as well. You don't see film's like these nowadays and I know everyone has been saying this over and over again, but "The Seventh Seal" possesses a type of beauty that could only be captured by someone like Ingmar Bergman and it is a rare occasion that someone like him comes around. The lighting and shadows in this film add to the already beautiful black and white visuals. In my opinion the most beautiful scenes visually have to be the opening scene and the ending scenes (not going to spoil it) To take in the beauty and to somewhat understand "The Seventh Seal" you have to watch it multiple times. The visuals, music and the overall ambiance of the film added to the already outright fantastic story and powerful underlying themes creates a beautifully eery film. I have praised Ingmar Bergman and his films enough already, all I have to say it "The Seventh Seal" is a masterpiece and an untouchable classic.

    A man seeks answers about life, death, and the existence of God as he plays chess against the Grim Reaper during the Black Plague. That fooled me. The movie is not that interesting. Some people might analyze each and every scene and dialog and come up with their own interpretations of what Bergman wanted to say. Jacksh*t. Now usually i love such kind of movies. I am not a fan of commercial craps like fast and furious or the recent man of steel. I am a sucker for good stories, script and character development but this movie had nothing.The dialogs were so darn lame a 14 y.o. could have written them. The pace was so slow the movie felt more like 150 minutes instead of its 90 minute run time. This is the second Bergman film i have viewed, the first being Persona which i also felt was overrated but at least kept me interested and concerned with it all along. I am sure this guy knew his movies but one doesn't make movies only for their fans but for a wider audience. How could you call this guy an artist. All he ever does is try to make a deep engrossing movie that asks its viewers certain important questions about life and the idea of a god but what he ends up making is a sh*t sandwich that should never be viewed under any circumstances. 1/10

    Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, "The Seventh Seal" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. Taking its title from the Book of Revelation, "The Seventh Seal" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: "I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me," he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented. Bergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (&Aring;ke Fridell), squire J&ouml;ns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.

    Plot: A Knight, Antonius Block, returns to his homeland Sweden with his squire (Jons), from a ten year long Crusade, only to find his country in the clutches of infamous plague--the Black Death (mid-1300s). On his journey home, he encounters the physical form of death itself (Bengt Ekerot) and engages him in an intriguing game of Chess to actually buy some time for some purpose of his. In this Swedish masterpiece the director, very artistically, collaborates tragic events of Europe caused by a widespread plague (bubonic plague-symptoms include a Swollen gland) with the "Book Of Revelation" primarily focusing on Apocalypse. The main characters have been chosen such that they represent various personalities and mental states of the sufferers. For example, the knight represents a delusional person who isn't sure if his Crusade had any point to it, his squire--a good man at heart--wonders where is God in this hour of need, the priest represents a power hungry man who instills fear in the society for his own benefit. The young actor couple and their child represent a God loving family who will survive the calamity. The whole country is suffering and there is confusion everywhere. People are punishing themselves to achieve absolution. Among all this hardship there still are people who are jolly and enjoying their lives to the hilt. Some of them are realizing their true selves. Even the Knight finds a purpose to his life and saves the young family from the clutches of Death. He eventually, with his wife and followers, dances with the Death. This 'dance' has become an iconic image of world cinema. A definite must watch. 8.5/10

    The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's take on religion and death. The film follows the story of Antonius Block, a knight who is returning home after having gone through the crusades. The country is now dominated by the Black Death and he ends up facing the grim reaper himself during his trip. The scenes between both of these characters are often intriguing, chilling and even comical. Block constantly questions the meaning of life and tries to accept his fatal destiny. The scenes with the witch character were very moving and illustrated how merciless and radical people could be at that period. I have one gripe with the film which is basically the acting. While most of the cast provides great performances (Especially Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot), I found some of the secondary characters like Jof, Mia and Blacksmith Plog annoying at times. Bergman uses a lot of theatricality here and I felt that there were scenes involving these folks, which were too repetitive and a bit dull. However, the overall result is mesmerizing and a definite must-see for those who are fans of Bergman's work or everyone who just appreciates a quality introspective film.

    The events and themes of Ingar Bergman's classic The Seventh Seal show numerous examples of existentialism. Throughout the film, characters blame occurrences such as the black plague on God, helplessly resorting to the idea that they have no individual control over their destinies. Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who "hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles." The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choicesas is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival.
