    Manhattan Murder Mystery is considered an important film in Woody Allen's long and illustrious cinematographic career as it is an exemplary proof of his faithfulness to Manhattan and people who live over there. As he knows both of them very well, more than a suspense thriller, his film appears as an acute observation of Manhattan people. The viewer is shown what Manhattan is and what type of people inhabit this area which has the reputation of being one of New York city's best known addresses. The film is replete with typically Woody Allen style humor which consists of short and witty remarks about people and their idiosyncrasies. For this reason, director Woody Allen created his own alter ego in the form of Larry Lipton, an intellectual editor who seems to be getting closer to a young woman as his wife is getting much too curious about a death which happened in their neighborhood. Emotional problems between husbands and wives occupy a good deal of screen space in Woody Allen's films. This is also the case with this film as its numerous subplots deal with the emotional turmoil of men and women. Lastly, there is something enigmatic about movie titles as there are times when viewers don't get to see much of what is described in the title. Judging from that yardstick, Manhattan Murder Mystery tries hard to cash on to that obsession and also succeeds. This is probably one reason why it enabled Woody Allen to show his cinematographic preferences in this film by including numerous important scenes from his favorite Hollywood films.

    With having found myself over the last few months unwittingly putting films of Woody Allen right at the back of the line of my "must watch" pile of movies,I decided shortly after finding out that a poll for the best films of 1993 was being held on IMDb's Classic Film board,that I would instantly put Woody Allen's 1993 right at the front,so that I could at last uncover the mysterious Manhattan murder. The plot: Returning to their apartment building after watching a game of hookey, husband and wife Larry and Carol Lipton run into near by residents,and fellow husband and wife,Paul and Lilian House.Making small talk with Paul and Lilian as they find themselves in the building's elevator with them,Larry and Carol are caught by surprise when Paul and Lilian suddenly invite them round for a late night coffee.Ignoring her husbands less then subtle signs of annoyance,Carol accepts the House's kind offer. As Larry gets bored out of existence by Paul showing him all of his stamp collection,Carol finds every minute that she spends with Lilian to be a true joy,who along with having a similar craving that Carol has for French deserts,is also very keen on her at- home gym,which leads to Carol greatly admiring Lilian,due to how amazingly fit and healthy she looks. The next night: Coming back from a night spent at the opera,Carol and Paul's fun night is stopped in its tracks,when they are given the tragic news the earlier that night,Lilian House had died of a heart attack.Feeling shaken over not just the death of her friend,but also the very odd,calm manner that Paul seemed to be in,Carol pushes Larry's reasoning that Paul is just grieving in a "different" manner right to the side,and begins to wonder if the thing that killed Lilian House was really a heart attack,or something much more sinister?... View on the film: Picking up a sub-plot that was originally meant for the duo's 1977 movie Annie Hall that got cut from the script due to feeling out of place with the rest of the plot,the screenplay by Marshall Brickman and co- writer/actor and director auteur Woody Allen impressively keep the movie away from every feeling dusty by cleverly balancing a tightly-coiled, surprisingly thrilling murder-mystery with characters like Carol Lipton,who will go to increasingly insane leginths to prove that their "hunch" is correct. Shooting the film in a "floating", non-shaky Cam style,Allen gives the movie a wonderful fresh atmosphere,with the scenes that Larry and Carol share together having an expert,improve-like feel about them,which helps to give each of Allen's and Brickman's lines (with "I cant listen to that much Wagner ya know.I start to get the urge to invade to conquer Poland!",being a particularly hilarious highlight) a real sharpness. Along with the crisp one-liners,Allen also gives the movie some terrific sly nods to Film Noir,from going to see Double Imdematey at a cinema,to an extremely stylish ending ,that has strong shades of 1947 Orson Welles Film Noir The Lady from Shanghai. Reuniting for the first time since 1979,Woody Allen and Diane Keaton both give strong performance's which set out to prove,that despite not appear on screen together for more than 10 years,neither of them has lost the other ones rhythm.Bounceing off a wonderfully agitated Allen,who would much rather be in bed then going round amateur sleuthing,Keaton shows Carol to be someone with an electrifying,and risky personality,who cant resits keeping away from solving the Manhattan murder mystery.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery marks Woody Allen's return to comedy after several steady years of cranking out dramas with underlying comedic themes. One could look at this film as him giving into the ones who demanded comedy for so many years, as he again creates a character hellbent on perfection and consumed by his petulant neuroses. Looking at this from a more comedic angle than his previous works, this is one of the funniest Woody Allen movies I have yet to see, surpassing even the heavily comedic undertones of works such as Midnight in Paris and Whatever Works. Allen rounds up Diane Keaton again in the leading female role, perfectly replicating the kind of atmosphere he created in Annie Hall, one of his first films to be recognized by even the Academy as a significant achievement in dramatic filmmaking. The two are a couple, named Larry and Carol Lipton, respectively, who are invited to coffee by Paul House (Jerry Adler) and Lilian (Lynn Cohen), who live next door to them in a highrise building. They have a few cups of coffee, as Carol enthusiastically talks with Lilian about her new treadmill, as they are both trying to remain in shape as they approach their elderly years. They leave the apartment not long after and return home to their quiet little sanctuary (mainly so Larry can catch the Bob Hope movie on Television). The next day, after returning home, they see a crowd outside of the House's apartment and find officers and a coroner on scene reporting that Lilian died of a heart attack. This comes as a grand shock to both Larry and Carol seeing as Lilian appeared healthier and more active than folks half her age, but it comes as a greater shock to Carol that the next day upon seeing Paul that he doesn't seem burdened or even upset by the sudden death of his wife. This sends Carol into a Nancy Drew-like frenzy, sneaking into the House's apartment, invading their privacy, and completely going overboard in her amateur investigation. Larry becomes frustrated at Carol's childish, intrusive behavior, but becomes more concerned when he notices that their friend Ted (Alan Alda) becomes entangled with the "mystery" at hand here and is getting awfully close to his wife. He realizes that in order to try and even continue a relationship with this woman that he'll need to play along and overall regain her attention. This is when Manhattan Murder Mystery becomes more about love and passion (or lack thereof) than it does the inherent murder and/or mystery. We see that Carol is doing this Nancy Drew investigation not to irritate or intimidate her husband, but almost as a way to cope with a dying, less successful marriage. This is her only outlet of excitement in an increasingly bitter world. Woody Allen marinated in the field of drama so long that American audiences thought he lacked the skills and the ability to make a compelling, silly, ribald comedy. Consider those audiences served by the filmmaking desperado himself. Allen delivers not only a funny, but a terrifically engrossing drama about the dying spark in a once prosperous marital relationship and the ridiculous methods one will use as a catalyst in desperate times. Allen and Keaton, once more, put on a fabulous show, giving us believable characters to enjoy watching, and side characters such as Jerry Adler and Alan Alda are fun to watch and provide grand entertainment. This is one of the strongest comedies Allen has ever made, way more competent that one of his odes to slapstick. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Jerry Adler, and Lynn Cohen. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    A middle-aged couple (Woody Allen and Diane Keaton) suspects foul play when their neighbor's wife suddenly drops dead. You know, how many films can you do about loving New York starring Woody Allen and Diane Keaton? Apparently a fair amount, as this film is one more on the pile -- and it is a pile of winners. Sure, you have Zach Braff's film debut that probably never should have happened, but that is forgivable. Who killed the neighbor? Why? Did anyone kill her? And then, is she even dead? This truly is a mystery, with ample amounts of comedy thrown in. And, because it is Woody humor, it is brilliant with its blend of easy jokes and more intellectual jabs (such as the reference to invading Poland while listening to Wagner).

    After 20 years of marriage, and with one son in college, Larry (Woody Allen) and Carol Lipton (Diane Keaton) try to accommodate with each other's interests, and from the very first hilarious exchanges, we get the point on how dramatically opposed they happen to be. To give you an idea, Larry loves watching ice hockey games while Carol prefers to listen to Wagner; she loves Manhattan's nightlife while he'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed. The differences between Carol and Larry get more obvious when they meet Mr. and Mrs. House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen), an old couple living in the same floor. In a remarkably dialog-driven sequence, we feel Carol's enthusiasm to have an extra-time for socializing and Larry's impatience to live and stop enduring Mr. House's collection of stamps. At the end, we're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking, their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism. They have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of "Manhattan", which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film's three titular 'M'. We learn that Carol wants to open a restaurant, Larry believes it's a foolish decision to take so late in life, yet one of their recently divorced friends Ted (Alan Alda) encourages her. We get it; Larry enjoys his life's pacific serenity while Carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it's too late. Many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ, but Allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous "Husbands and Wives" as if he was tired of hostile arguments. He leaves more room for Ted, whose adventurous temperament fits Carol's thirst for newness, not without feeling jealous about that. It's a pivotal, even crucial moment in Carol and Harry's marital life. Yet the title doesn't lie on the film's premise: it's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine. Speaking of the mystery, if the previous scene where they meet the friendly Houses' couple reminded me of "Rosemary's Baby" when Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes met the Castevets, I was even more struck by the plot's similarities when after a night out, Carol and Larry discovers that Mrs. House died of a heart attack. Much more, Mr. House looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a twin-cemetery, raising Carol's suspicion. "She had a heart condition," he says, Carol insists that Mrs. House never mentioned that. At that point, we know what she's about, she smells something fishy and whether she's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills. And the difference of attitudes between Carol and Larry is the film's comedic basis. Indeed, the conflict between Carol who wants to go further and Larry who wants her to stop, will originate one of Woody Allen's funniest lines: "Is that what you do when I'm forbidding? I'm not going to forbid you a lot, if you do". The greatest delight of "Manhattan Murder Mystery" relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa. Carol's amateurish investigation, her growing complicity with Ted, and Larry's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril, are magnificently portrayed. And all these interactions culminate with the help of Marcia Fox, played by a scene-stealing Angelica Huston, a dark and sensual authoress and professional poker-player, so intuitive that she'll even steal Carol's thunder in the crime- solving process, and fascinate both Ted and Larry. As a counterpart to Carol's personality, like Ted for Larry, Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After, "Husbands and Wives", a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow, "Manhattan Murder Mystery" feels like a moment of pure refreshment. If it's not the best of Woody Allen's rich filmography, not nominated for a Best Original Screenplay or Best Supporting Acting Oscar (while it deserved some accolades) it's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we'd expect from Woody Allen. And the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely Diane Keaton's comeback and her incredible chemistry with Woody Allen. Indeed, I have much admiration to Mia Farrow, and she'll be forever associated with some of Allen's greatest achievements, but there has always been a sort of inner sweetness in Farrow that confined to poignancy and even sometimes to pathos, and this characteristic reaches a paroxysm in "Husbands and Wives" where not only her character, but the actress herself looked both unhappy, embodying the marital conflict that was poisoning their lives. Woody Allen said "Mia likes to do funny things, but she's not as broad a comedian as Diane is", although I don't approve the manner but I have to agree with the director, Mia Farrow is fine but as far as comedy is concerned, Diane Keaton has that little sparkle that makes all the difference. Yes, we have the New York middle-class lifestyle, the intellectual discussions with the couples of friends, Allen's neurotic personality ("a dead body and claustrophobia, a neurotic's jackpot"), his distaste for Wagner, a compositor who gives him the "urge to invade Poland" and the whole romantic twists and commentaries on men and women's relationships, all the ingredients for a great Allen's film are here but Diane Keaton is the icing on the cake. And believe me, she's for more than three quarters in what make "Manhattan Murder Mystery" such a delicious pastry, reminding us how a great chemistry she always had with Woody Allen, hell, even when they argue, they're hilarious.

    This frantic comedy, released during the tumultuous tabloid scandal between Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, is co-scripted by Marshall Brickman, Allen's writing partner for MANHATTAN and ANNIE HALL. ANNIE HALL was originally conceived as a murder mystery before reimagined as the rom-com we know and love, and here's a double-whammy collaboration: Diane Keaton, Woody's co-star/love interest during the seventies, returns to the iconic director's canon. And the results are disastrous. Allen and Keaton play a THIN MAN "Nick and Nora" like couple who meet their elderly neighbors  a seemingly normal stamp collecting coot and his talkative wife. The wife dies and the husband doesn't seem very jaded. Keaton, overacting desperately, investigates the possible murder, which at first seems a long shot. When she's not tailing the accused through the New York, or teaming up with her charming friend Alan Alda, the film consists of tedious dialog between Allen and Keaton, whose chemistry is, to quote Alvy Singer in ANNIE HALL, "A dead shark." Woody Allen delivers flat one-liners like a sleepy clown after the circus has let out. And when the convoluted mystery is solved there's still twenty minutes to figure out what exactly? Although the climax, homage to Orson Welle's THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI using actual scenes of the famous Fun House montage, is a clever twist, the rest is a failed class reunion. And even "worse than the chicken at Tresky's." For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com

    This movie started out great but after about an hour and a half (after a body is found) it deteriorates into garbage. Woody still managed to make me laugh from time to time but sorry a lot of this film was contrived and badly written and not like the Woody Allen I remember. These aging actors just can't convincingly pull off badly scripted marital jealousies and drama. Seriously at 57 (the age of Allen in film) he is wondering how often a couple should have sex? Only it is not supposed to be funny in that way. The worst part is the parody of a film noir murder mystery deteriorates into a frenetic unbelievable tired terrible last half hour. At least good film noir mysteries had captivating and somewhat believable stories this film did not. It is not funny it is nothing but boring and contrived. These aged reunions are usually a depressing flop and this was no exception.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) This movie almost defines delightful--at least for people who already like Woody Allen. (For some, Allen will always be irritating, no matter how brilliant the movie.) Without a shred of pretension, and without really any suspense in the usual murder mystery way, we get sucked into what is perhaps the most believable of murder mysteries ever. The reason is simple. It's told as if two very ordinary, slightly bookish, not so slightly neurotic New Yorkers stumble on a murder. It's the story of what we would all do if we thought our neighbor had murdered his wife. The bumbling, the doubts, the revelations, the sneaking around, the giggling. It helps (a lot) that we have the reuniting of Allen with Diane Keaton, and it's a nice breeze in the room to have both Alan Alda at his ordinary guy best and Angelica Huston as a true New Yorker brimming with confidence and savvy. (Huston is from California, a daughter in the famous movie family. Alda, nicely enough, is a New Yorker for real.) Don't expect anything deep, hilarious, or clever (three of the many intentions in Allen's movies). But it's really well made, superbly written, acted with utter believability, paced with snap, and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period (set designer, photographer, editor, etc.), almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first place--a Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein. I loved it.

    This is a very good movie. It could have been a classic if only it had been done by someone else. Woody Allen is an excellent comic whose character is well established. I was a fan of his stand up routines on Ed Sullivan's show many years ago. I like most of his movies. This movie is more than just watchable. It is quite enjoyable, but... If Sir Alfred had done this same basic story with the Hitchcock air of suspense and some haunting music and a cast of someone like James Stewart or Cary Grant and Doris Day (as she was in The Man Who Knew Too Much or Midnight Lace, or keep Diane Keaton and lose the one liners)it could have been better. It needs a little comedy but not rat a tat funny lines that sound like a routine. I think I read somewhere that Cary Grant and James Stewart are not answering their phones now, but there must be someone in Hollywood who could fill parts of their shoes. Matt Damon or Mark Wahlberg or Matthew Broderick as the person suddenly drug into a mystery. Nicolas Cage maybe. Christina Applegate. Michelle Pfeiffer. It could still have a bit of comedy but more mystery and perhaps a younger lady in the role of the heart attack victim so there is a bit of doubt. I'm just sayin'. And does it have to be Manhatten? Frisco Murder Mystery... Muscle Beach Murder Mystery... Calumet City Murder Mystery...

They leave the apartment not long after and return home to their quiet little sanctuary (mainly so Larry can catch the Bob Hope movie on Television). The next day, after returning home, they see a crowd outside of the House's apartment and find officers and a coroner on scene reporting that Lilian died of a heart attack. This comes as a grand shock to both Larry and Carol seeing as Lilian appeared healthier and more active than folks half her age, but it comes as a greater shock to Carol that the next day upon seeing Paul that he doesn't seem burdened or even upset by the sudden death of his wife. This sends Carol into a Nancy Drew-like frenzy, sneaking into the House's apartment, invading their privacy, and completely going overboard in her amateur investigation. Larry becomes frustrated at Carol's childish, intrusive behavior, but becomes more concerned when he notices that their friend Ted (Alan Alda) becomes entangled with the "mystery" at hand here and is getting awfully close to his wife. He realizes that in order to try and even continue a relationship with this woman that he'll need to play along and overall regain her attention. This is when Manhattan Murder Mystery becomes more about love and passion (or lack thereof) than it does the inherent murder and/or mystery. We see that Carol is doing this Nancy Drew investigation not to irritate or intimidate her husband, but almost as a way to cope with a dying, less successful marriage. This is her only outlet of excitement in an increasingly bitter world. Woody Allen marinated in the field of drama so long that American audiences thought he lacked the skills and the ability to make a compelling, silly, ribald comedy. Consider those audiences served by the filmmaking desperado himself. Allen delivers not only a funny, but a terrifically engrossing drama about the dying spark in a once prosperous marital relationship and the ridiculous methods one will use as a catalyst in desperate times. Allen and Keaton, once more, put on a fabulous show, giving us believable characters to enjoy watching, and side characters such as Jerry Adler and Alan Alda are fun to watch and provide grand entertainment. This is one of the strongest comedies Allen has ever made, way more competent that one of his odes to slapstick. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Jerry Adler, and Lynn Cohen. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    A middle-aged couple (Woody Allen and Diane Keaton) suspects foul play when their neighbor's wife suddenly drops dead. You know, how many films can you do about loving New York starring Woody Allen and Diane Keaton? Apparently a fair amount, as this film is one more on the pile -- and it is a pile of winners. Sure, you have Zach Braff's film debut that probably never should have happened, but that is forgivable. Who killed the neighbor? Why? Did anyone kill her? And then, is she even dead? This truly is a mystery, with ample amounts of comedy thrown in. And, because it is Woody humor, it is brilliant with its blend of easy jokes and more intellectual jabs (such as the reference to invading Poland while listening to Wagner).

    After 20 years of marriage, and with one son in college, Larry (Woody Allen) and Carol Lipton (Diane Keaton) try to accommodate with each other's interests, and from the very first hilarious exchanges, we get the point on how dramatically opposed they happen to be. To give you an idea, Larry loves watching ice hockey games while Carol prefers to listen to Wagner; she loves Manhattan's nightlife while he'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed. The differences between Carol and Larry get more obvious when they meet Mr. and Mrs. House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen), an old couple living in the same floor. In a remarkably dialog-driven sequence, we feel Carol's enthusiasm to have an extra-time for socializing and Larry's impatience to live and stop enduring Mr. House's collection of stamps. At the end, we're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking, their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism. They have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of "Manhattan", which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film's three titular 'M'. We learn that Carol wants to open a restaurant, Larry believes it's a foolish decision to take so late in life, yet one of their recently divorced friends Ted (Alan Alda) encourages her. We get it; Larry enjoys his life's pacific serenity while Carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it's too late. Many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ, but Allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous "Husbands and Wives" as if he was tired of hostile arguments. He leaves more room for Ted, whose adventurous temperament fits Carol's thirst for newness, not without feeling jealous about that. It's a pivotal, even crucial moment in Carol and Harry's marital life. Yet the title doesn't lie on the film's premise: it's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine. Speaking of the mystery, if the previous scene where they meet the friendly Houses' couple reminded me of "Rosemary's Baby" when Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes met the Castevets, I was even more struck by the plot's similarities when after a night out, Carol and Larry discovers that Mrs. House died of a heart attack. Much more, Mr. House looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a twin-cemetery, raising Carol's suspicion. "She had a heart condition," he says, Carol insists that Mrs. House never mentioned that. At that point, we know what she's about, she smells something fishy and whether she's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills. And the difference of attitudes between Carol and Larry is the film's comedic basis. Indeed, the conflict between Carol who wants to go further and Larry who wants her to stop, will originate one of Woody Allen's funniest lines: "Is that what you do when I'm forbidding? I'm not going to forbid you a lot, if you do". The greatest delight of "Manhattan Murder Mystery" relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa. Carol's amateurish investigation, her growing complicity with Ted, and Larry's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril, are magnificently portrayed. And all these interactions culminate with the help of Marcia Fox, played by a scene-stealing Angelica Huston, a dark and sensual authoress and professional poker-player, so intuitive that she'll even steal Carol's thunder in the crime- solving process, and fascinate both Ted and Larry. As a counterpart to Carol's personality, like Ted for Larry, Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After, "Husbands and Wives", a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow, "Manhattan Murder Mystery" feels like a moment of pure refreshment. If it's not the best of Woody Allen's rich filmography, not nominated for a Best Original Screenplay or Best Supporting Acting Oscar (while it deserved some accolades) it's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we'd expect from Woody Allen. And the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely Diane Keaton's comeback and her incredible chemistry with Woody Allen. Indeed, I have much admiration to Mia Farrow, and she'll be forever associated with some of Allen's greatest achievements, but there has always been a sort of inner sweetness in Farrow that confined to poignancy and even sometimes to pathos, and this characteristic reaches a paroxysm in "Husbands and Wives" where not only her character, but the actress herself looked both unhappy, embodying the marital conflict that was poisoning their lives. Woody Allen said "Mia likes to do funny things, but she's not as broad a comedian as Diane is", although I don't approve the manner but I have to agree with the director, Mia Farrow is fine but as far as comedy is concerned, Diane Keaton has that little sparkle that makes all the difference. Yes, we have the New York middle-class lifestyle, the intellectual discussions with the couples of friends, Allen's neurotic personality ("a dead body and claustrophobia, a neurotic's jackpot"), his distaste for Wagner, a compositor who gives him the "urge to invade Poland" and the whole romantic twists and commentaries on men and women's relationships, all the ingredients for a great Allen's film are here but Diane Keaton is the icing on the cake. And believe me, she's for more than three quarters in what make "Manhattan Murder Mystery" such a delicious pastry, reminding us how a great chemistry she always had with Woody Allen, hell, even when they argue, they're hilarious.

    This frantic comedy, released during the tumultuous tabloid scandal between Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, is co-scripted by Marshall Brickman, Allen's writing partner for MANHATTAN and ANNIE HALL. ANNIE HALL was originally conceived as a murder mystery before reimagined as the rom-com we know and love, and here's a double-whammy collaboration: Diane Keaton, Woody's co-star/love interest during the seventies, returns to the iconic director's canon. And the results are disastrous. Allen and Keaton play a THIN MAN "Nick and Nora" like couple who meet their elderly neighbors  a seemingly normal stamp collecting coot and his talkative wife. The wife dies and the husband doesn't seem very jaded. Keaton, overacting desperately, investigates the possible murder, which at first seems a long shot. When she's not tailing the accused through the New York, or teaming up with her charming friend Alan Alda, the film consists of tedious dialog between Allen and Keaton, whose chemistry is, to quote Alvy Singer in ANNIE HALL, "A dead shark." Woody Allen delivers flat one-liners like a sleepy clown after the circus has let out. And when the convoluted mystery is solved there's still twenty minutes to figure out what exactly? Although the climax, homage to Orson Welle's THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI using actual scenes of the famous Fun House montage, is a clever twist, the rest is a failed class reunion. And even "worse than the chicken at Tresky's." For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com

    This movie started out great but after about an hour and a half (after a body is found) it deteriorates into garbage. Woody still managed to make me laugh from time to time but sorry a lot of this film was contrived and badly written and not like the Woody Allen I remember. These aging actors just can't convincingly pull off badly scripted marital jealousies and drama. Seriously at 57 (the age of Allen in film) he is wondering how often a couple should have sex? Only it is not supposed to be funny in that way. The worst part is the parody of a film noir murder mystery deteriorates into a frenetic unbelievable tired terrible last half hour. At least good film noir mysteries had captivating and somewhat believable stories this film did not. It is not funny it is nothing but boring and contrived. These aged reunions are usually a depressing flop and this was no exception.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) This movie almost defines delightful--at least for people who already like Woody Allen. (For some, Allen will always be irritating, no matter how brilliant the movie.) Without a shred of pretension, and without really any suspense in the usual murder mystery way, we get sucked into what is perhaps the most believable of murder mysteries ever. The reason is simple. It's told as if two very ordinary, slightly bookish, not so slightly neurotic New Yorkers stumble on a murder. It's the story of what we would all do if we thought our neighbor had murdered his wife. The bumbling, the doubts, the revelations, the sneaking around, the giggling. It helps (a lot) that we have the reuniting of Allen with Diane Keaton, and it's a nice breeze in the room to have both Alan Alda at his ordinary guy best and Angelica Huston as a true New Yorker brimming with confidence and savvy. (Huston is from California, a daughter in the famous movie family. Alda, nicely enough, is a New Yorker for real.) Don't expect anything deep, hilarious, or clever (three of the many intentions in Allen's movies). But it's really well made, superbly written, acted with utter believability, paced with snap, and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period (set designer, photographer, editor, etc.), almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first place--a Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein. I loved it.

    This is a very good movie. It could have been a classic if only it had been done by someone else. Woody Allen is an excellent comic whose character is well established. I was a fan of his stand up routines on Ed Sullivan's show many years ago. I like most of his movies. This movie is more than just watchable. It is quite enjoyable, but... If Sir Alfred had done this same basic story with the Hitchcock air of suspense and some haunting music and a cast of someone like James Stewart or Cary Grant and Doris Day (as she was in The Man Who Knew Too Much or Midnight Lace, or keep Diane Keaton and lose the one liners)it could have been better. It needs a little comedy but not rat a tat funny lines that sound like a routine. I think I read somewhere that Cary Grant and James Stewart are not answering their phones now, but there must be someone in Hollywood who could fill parts of their shoes. Matt Damon or Mark Wahlberg or Matthew Broderick as the person suddenly drug into a mystery. Nicolas Cage maybe. Christina Applegate. Michelle Pfeiffer. It could still have a bit of comedy but more mystery and perhaps a younger lady in the role of the heart attack victim so there is a bit of doubt. I'm just sayin'. And does it have to be Manhatten? Frisco Murder Mystery... Muscle Beach Murder Mystery... Calumet City Murder Mystery...

    Manhattan Murder Mystery is considered an important film in Woody Allen's long and illustrious cinematographic career as it is an exemplary proof of his faithfulness to Manhattan and people who live over there. As he knows both of them very well, more than a suspense thriller, his film appears as an acute observation of Manhattan people. The viewer is shown what Manhattan is and what type of people inhabit this area which has the reputation of being one of New York city's best known addresses. The film is replete with typically Woody Allen style humor which consists of short and witty remarks about people and their idiosyncrasies. For this reason, director Woody Allen created his own alter ego in the form of Larry Lipton, an intellectual editor who seems to be getting closer to a young woman as his wife is getting much too curious about a death which happened in their neighborhood. Emotional problems between husbands and wives occupy a good deal of screen space in Woody Allen's films. This is also the case with this film as its numerous subplots deal with the emotional turmoil of men and women. Lastly, there is something enigmatic about movie titles as there are times when viewers don't get to see much of what is described in the title. Judging from that yardstick, Manhattan Murder Mystery tries hard to cash on to that obsession and also succeeds. This is probably one reason why it enabled Woody Allen to show his cinematographic preferences in this film by including numerous important scenes from his favorite Hollywood films.

    With having found myself over the last few months unwittingly putting films of Woody Allen right at the back of the line of my "must watch" pile of movies,I decided shortly after finding out that a poll for the best films of 1993 was being held on IMDb's Classic Film board,that I would instantly put Woody Allen's 1993 right at the front,so that I could at last uncover the mysterious Manhattan murder. The plot: Returning to their apartment building after watching a game of hookey, husband and wife Larry and Carol Lipton run into near by residents,and fellow husband and wife,Paul and Lilian House.Making small talk with Paul and Lilian as they find themselves in the building's elevator with them,Larry and Carol are caught by surprise when Paul and Lilian suddenly invite them round for a late night coffee.Ignoring her husbands less then subtle signs of annoyance,Carol accepts the House's kind offer. As Larry gets bored out of existence by Paul showing him all of his stamp collection,Carol finds every minute that she spends with Lilian to be a true joy,who along with having a similar craving that Carol has for French deserts,is also very keen on her at- home gym,which leads to Carol greatly admiring Lilian,due to how amazingly fit and healthy she looks. The next night: Coming back from a night spent at the opera,Carol and Paul's fun night is stopped in its tracks,when they are given the tragic news the earlier that night,Lilian House had died of a heart attack.Feeling shaken over not just the death of her friend,but also the very odd,calm manner that Paul seemed to be in,Carol pushes Larry's reasoning that Paul is just grieving in a "different" manner right to the side,and begins to wonder if the thing that killed Lilian House was really a heart attack,or something much more sinister?... View on the film: Picking up a sub-plot that was originally meant for the duo's 1977 movie Annie Hall that got cut from the script due to feeling out of place with the rest of the plot,the screenplay by Marshall Brickman and co- writer/actor and director auteur Woody Allen impressively keep the movie away from every feeling dusty by cleverly balancing a tightly-coiled, surprisingly thrilling murder-mystery with characters like Carol Lipton,who will go to increasingly insane leginths to prove that their "hunch" is correct. Shooting the film in a "floating", non-shaky Cam style,Allen gives the movie a wonderful fresh atmosphere,with the scenes that Larry and Carol share together having an expert,improve-like feel about them,which helps to give each of Allen's and Brickman's lines (with "I cant listen to that much Wagner ya know.I start to get the urge to invade to conquer Poland!",being a particularly hilarious highlight) a real sharpness. Along with the crisp one-liners,Allen also gives the movie some terrific sly nods to Film Noir,from going to see Double Imdematey at a cinema,to an extremely stylish ending ,that has strong shades of 1947 Orson Welles Film Noir The Lady from Shanghai. Reuniting for the first time since 1979,Woody Allen and Diane Keaton both give strong performance's which set out to prove,that despite not appear on screen together for more than 10 years,neither of them has lost the other ones rhythm.Bounceing off a wonderfully agitated Allen,who would much rather be in bed then going round amateur sleuthing,Keaton shows Carol to be someone with an electrifying,and risky personality,who cant resits keeping away from solving the Manhattan murder mystery.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery marks Woody Allen's return to comedy after several steady years of cranking out dramas with underlying comedic themes. One could look at this film as him giving into the ones who demanded comedy for so many years, as he again creates a character hellbent on perfection and consumed by his petulant neuroses. Looking at this from a more comedic angle than his previous works, this is one of the funniest Woody Allen movies I have yet to see, surpassing even the heavily comedic undertones of works such as Midnight in Paris and Whatever Works. Allen rounds up Diane Keaton again in the leading female role, perfectly replicating the kind of atmosphere he created in Annie Hall, one of his first films to be recognized by even the Academy as a significant achievement in dramatic filmmaking. The two are a couple, named Larry and Carol Lipton, respectively, who are invited to coffee by Paul House (Jerry Adler) and Lilian (Lynn Cohen), who live next door to them in a highrise building. They have a few cups of coffee, as Carol enthusiastically talks with Lilian about her new treadmill, as they are both trying to remain in shape as they approach their elderly years. They leave the apartment not long after and return home to their quiet little sanctuary (mainly so Larry can catch the Bob Hope movie on Television). The next day, after returning home, they see a crowd outside of the House's apartment and find officers and a coroner on scene reporting that Lilian died of a heart attack. This comes as a grand shock to both Larry and Carol seeing as Lilian appeared healthier and more active than folks half her age, but it comes as a greater shock to Carol that the next day upon seeing Paul that he doesn't seem burdened or even upset by the sudden death of his wife. This sends Carol into a Nancy Drew-like frenzy, sneaking into the House's apartment, invading their privacy, and completely going overboard in her amateur investigation. Larry becomes frustrated at Carol's childish, intrusive behavior, but becomes more concerned when he notices that their friend Ted (Alan Alda) becomes entangled with the "mystery" at hand here and is getting awfully close to his wife. He realizes that in order to try and even continue a relationship with this woman that he'll need to play along and overall regain her attention. This is when Manhattan Murder Mystery becomes more about love and passion (or lack thereof) than it does the inherent murder and/or mystery. We see that Carol is doing this Nancy Drew investigation not to irritate or intimidate her husband, but almost as a way to cope with a dying, less successful marriage. This is her only outlet of excitement in an increasingly bitter world. Woody Allen marinated in the field of drama so long that American audiences thought he lacked the skills and the ability to make a compelling, silly, ribald comedy. Consider those audiences served by the filmmaking desperado himself. Allen delivers not only a funny, but a terrifically engrossing drama about the dying spark in a once prosperous marital relationship and the ridiculous methods one will use as a catalyst in desperate times. Allen and Keaton, once more, put on a fabulous show, giving us believable characters to enjoy watching, and side characters such as Jerry Adler and Alan Alda are fun to watch and provide grand entertainment. This is one of the strongest comedies Allen has ever made, way more competent that one of his odes to slapstick. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Jerry Adler, and Lynn Cohen.

As a counterpart to Carol's personality, like Ted for Larry, Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'.

    This frantic comedy, released during the tumultuous tabloid scandal between Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, is co-scripted by Marshall Brickman, Allen's writing partner for MANHATTAN and ANNIE HALL. ANNIE HALL was originally conceived as a murder mystery before reimagined as the rom-com we know and love, and here's a double-whammy collaboration: Diane Keaton, Woody's co-star/love interest during the seventies, returns to the iconic director's canon. And the results are disastrous. Allen and Keaton play a THIN MAN "Nick and Nora" like couple who meet their elderly neighbors  a seemingly normal stamp collecting coot and his talkative wife. The wife dies and the husband doesn't seem very jaded. Keaton, overacting desperately, investigates the possible murder, which at first seems a long shot. When she's not tailing the accused through the New York, or teaming up with her charming friend Alan Alda, the film consists of tedious dialog between Allen and Keaton, whose chemistry is, to quote Alvy Singer in ANNIE HALL, "A dead shark." Woody Allen delivers flat one-liners like a sleepy clown after the circus has let out. And when the convoluted mystery is solved there's still twenty minutes to figure out what exactly? Although the climax, homage to Orson Welle's THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI using actual scenes of the famous Fun House montage, is a clever twist, the rest is a failed class reunion. And even "worse than the chicken at Tresky's." For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com

    This movie started out great but after about an hour and a half (after a body is found) it deteriorates into garbage. Woody still managed to make me laugh from time to time but sorry a lot of this film was contrived and badly written and not like the Woody Allen I remember. These aging actors just can't convincingly pull off badly scripted marital jealousies and drama. Seriously at 57 (the age of Allen in film) he is wondering how often a couple should have sex? Only it is not supposed to be funny in that way. The worst part is the parody of a film noir murder mystery deteriorates into a frenetic unbelievable tired terrible last half hour. At least good film noir mysteries had captivating and somewhat believable stories this film did not. It is not funny it is nothing but boring and contrived. These aged reunions are usually a depressing flop and this was no exception.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) This movie almost defines delightful--at least for people who already like Woody Allen. (For some, Allen will always be irritating, no matter how brilliant the movie.) Without a shred of pretension, and without really any suspense in the usual murder mystery way, we get sucked into what is perhaps the most believable of murder mysteries ever. The reason is simple. It's told as if two very ordinary, slightly bookish, not so slightly neurotic New Yorkers stumble on a murder. It's the story of what we would all do if we thought our neighbor had murdered his wife. The bumbling, the doubts, the revelations, the sneaking around, the giggling. It helps (a lot) that we have the reuniting of Allen with Diane Keaton, and it's a nice breeze in the room to have both Alan Alda at his ordinary guy best and Angelica Huston as a true New Yorker brimming with confidence and savvy. (Huston is from California, a daughter in the famous movie family. Alda, nicely enough, is a New Yorker for real.) Don't expect anything deep, hilarious, or clever (three of the many intentions in Allen's movies). But it's really well made, superbly written, acted with utter believability, paced with snap, and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period (set designer, photographer, editor, etc.), almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first place--a Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein. I loved it.

    This is a very good movie. It could have been a classic if only it had been done by someone else. Woody Allen is an excellent comic whose character is well established. I was a fan of his stand up routines on Ed Sullivan's show many years ago. I like most of his movies. This movie is more than just watchable. It is quite enjoyable, but... If Sir Alfred had done this same basic story with the Hitchcock air of suspense and some haunting music and a cast of someone like James Stewart or Cary Grant and Doris Day (as she was in The Man Who Knew Too Much or Midnight Lace, or keep Diane Keaton and lose the one liners)it could have been better. It needs a little comedy but not rat a tat funny lines that sound like a routine. I think I read somewhere that Cary Grant and James Stewart are not answering their phones now, but there must be someone in Hollywood who could fill parts of their shoes. Matt Damon or Mark Wahlberg or Matthew Broderick as the person suddenly drug into a mystery. Nicolas Cage maybe. Christina Applegate. Michelle Pfeiffer. It could still have a bit of comedy but more mystery and perhaps a younger lady in the role of the heart attack victim so there is a bit of doubt. I'm just sayin'. And does it have to be Manhatten? Frisco Murder Mystery... Muscle Beach Murder Mystery... Calumet City Murder Mystery...

    Manhattan Murder Mystery is considered an important film in Woody Allen's long and illustrious cinematographic career as it is an exemplary proof of his faithfulness to Manhattan and people who live over there. As he knows both of them very well, more than a suspense thriller, his film appears as an acute observation of Manhattan people. The viewer is shown what Manhattan is and what type of people inhabit this area which has the reputation of being one of New York city's best known addresses. The film is replete with typically Woody Allen style humor which consists of short and witty remarks about people and their idiosyncrasies. For this reason, director Woody Allen created his own alter ego in the form of Larry Lipton, an intellectual editor who seems to be getting closer to a young woman as his wife is getting much too curious about a death which happened in their neighborhood. Emotional problems between husbands and wives occupy a good deal of screen space in Woody Allen's films. This is also the case with this film as its numerous subplots deal with the emotional turmoil of men and women. Lastly, there is something enigmatic about movie titles as there are times when viewers don't get to see much of what is described in the title. Judging from that yardstick, Manhattan Murder Mystery tries hard to cash on to that obsession and also succeeds. This is probably one reason why it enabled Woody Allen to show his cinematographic preferences in this film by including numerous important scenes from his favorite Hollywood films.

    With having found myself over the last few months unwittingly putting films of Woody Allen right at the back of the line of my "must watch" pile of movies,I decided shortly after finding out that a poll for the best films of 1993 was being held on IMDb's Classic Film board,that I would instantly put Woody Allen's 1993 right at the front,so that I could at last uncover the mysterious Manhattan murder. The plot: Returning to their apartment building after watching a game of hookey, husband and wife Larry and Carol Lipton run into near by residents,and fellow husband and wife,Paul and Lilian House.Making small talk with Paul and Lilian as they find themselves in the building's elevator with them,Larry and Carol are caught by surprise when Paul and Lilian suddenly invite them round for a late night coffee.Ignoring her husbands less then subtle signs of annoyance,Carol accepts the House's kind offer. As Larry gets bored out of existence by Paul showing him all of his stamp collection,Carol finds every minute that she spends with Lilian to be a true joy,who along with having a similar craving that Carol has for French deserts,is also very keen on her at- home gym,which leads to Carol greatly admiring Lilian,due to how amazingly fit and healthy she looks. The next night: Coming back from a night spent at the opera,Carol and Paul's fun night is stopped in its tracks,when they are given the tragic news the earlier that night,Lilian House had died of a heart attack.Feeling shaken over not just the death of her friend,but also the very odd,calm manner that Paul seemed to be in,Carol pushes Larry's reasoning that Paul is just grieving in a "different" manner right to the side,and begins to wonder if the thing that killed Lilian House was really a heart attack,or something much more sinister?... View on the film: Picking up a sub-plot that was originally meant for the duo's 1977 movie Annie Hall that got cut from the script due to feeling out of place with the rest of the plot,the screenplay by Marshall Brickman and co- writer/actor and director auteur Woody Allen impressively keep the movie away from every feeling dusty by cleverly balancing a tightly-coiled, surprisingly thrilling murder-mystery with characters like Carol Lipton,who will go to increasingly insane leginths to prove that their "hunch" is correct. Shooting the film in a "floating", non-shaky Cam style,Allen gives the movie a wonderful fresh atmosphere,with the scenes that Larry and Carol share together having an expert,improve-like feel about them,which helps to give each of Allen's and Brickman's lines (with "I cant listen to that much Wagner ya know.I start to get the urge to invade to conquer Poland!",being a particularly hilarious highlight) a real sharpness. Along with the crisp one-liners,Allen also gives the movie some terrific sly nods to Film Noir,from going to see Double Imdematey at a cinema,to an extremely stylish ending ,that has strong shades of 1947 Orson Welles Film Noir The Lady from Shanghai. Reuniting for the first time since 1979,Woody Allen and Diane Keaton both give strong performance's which set out to prove,that despite not appear on screen together for more than 10 years,neither of them has lost the other ones rhythm.Bounceing off a wonderfully agitated Allen,who would much rather be in bed then going round amateur sleuthing,Keaton shows Carol to be someone with an electrifying,and risky personality,who cant resits keeping away from solving the Manhattan murder mystery.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery marks Woody Allen's return to comedy after several steady years of cranking out dramas with underlying comedic themes. One could look at this film as him giving into the ones who demanded comedy for so many years, as he again creates a character hellbent on perfection and consumed by his petulant neuroses. Looking at this from a more comedic angle than his previous works, this is one of the funniest Woody Allen movies I have yet to see, surpassing even the heavily comedic undertones of works such as Midnight in Paris and Whatever Works. Allen rounds up Diane Keaton again in the leading female role, perfectly replicating the kind of atmosphere he created in Annie Hall, one of his first films to be recognized by even the Academy as a significant achievement in dramatic filmmaking. The two are a couple, named Larry and Carol Lipton, respectively, who are invited to coffee by Paul House (Jerry Adler) and Lilian (Lynn Cohen), who live next door to them in a highrise building. They have a few cups of coffee, as Carol enthusiastically talks with Lilian about her new treadmill, as they are both trying to remain in shape as they approach their elderly years. They leave the apartment not long after and return home to their quiet little sanctuary (mainly so Larry can catch the Bob Hope movie on Television). The next day, after returning home, they see a crowd outside of the House's apartment and find officers and a coroner on scene reporting that Lilian died of a heart attack. This comes as a grand shock to both Larry and Carol seeing as Lilian appeared healthier and more active than folks half her age, but it comes as a greater shock to Carol that the next day upon seeing Paul that he doesn't seem burdened or even upset by the sudden death of his wife. This sends Carol into a Nancy Drew-like frenzy, sneaking into the House's apartment, invading their privacy, and completely going overboard in her amateur investigation. Larry becomes frustrated at Carol's childish, intrusive behavior, but becomes more concerned when he notices that their friend Ted (Alan Alda) becomes entangled with the "mystery" at hand here and is getting awfully close to his wife. He realizes that in order to try and even continue a relationship with this woman that he'll need to play along and overall regain her attention. This is when Manhattan Murder Mystery becomes more about love and passion (or lack thereof) than it does the inherent murder and/or mystery. We see that Carol is doing this Nancy Drew investigation not to irritate or intimidate her husband, but almost as a way to cope with a dying, less successful marriage. This is her only outlet of excitement in an increasingly bitter world. Woody Allen marinated in the field of drama so long that American audiences thought he lacked the skills and the ability to make a compelling, silly, ribald comedy. Consider those audiences served by the filmmaking desperado himself. Allen delivers not only a funny, but a terrifically engrossing drama about the dying spark in a once prosperous marital relationship and the ridiculous methods one will use as a catalyst in desperate times. Allen and Keaton, once more, put on a fabulous show, giving us believable characters to enjoy watching, and side characters such as Jerry Adler and Alan Alda are fun to watch and provide grand entertainment. This is one of the strongest comedies Allen has ever made, way more competent that one of his odes to slapstick. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Jerry Adler, and Lynn Cohen. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    A middle-aged couple (Woody Allen and Diane Keaton) suspects foul play when their neighbor's wife suddenly drops dead. You know, how many films can you do about loving New York starring Woody Allen and Diane Keaton? Apparently a fair amount, as this film is one more on the pile -- and it is a pile of winners. Sure, you have Zach Braff's film debut that probably never should have happened, but that is forgivable. Who killed the neighbor? Why? Did anyone kill her? And then, is she even dead? This truly is a mystery, with ample amounts of comedy thrown in. And, because it is Woody humor, it is brilliant with its blend of easy jokes and more intellectual jabs (such as the reference to invading Poland while listening to Wagner).

    After 20 years of marriage, and with one son in college, Larry (Woody Allen) and Carol Lipton (Diane Keaton) try to accommodate with each other's interests, and from the very first hilarious exchanges, we get the point on how dramatically opposed they happen to be. To give you an idea, Larry loves watching ice hockey games while Carol prefers to listen to Wagner; she loves Manhattan's nightlife while he'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed. The differences between Carol and Larry get more obvious when they meet Mr. and Mrs. House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen), an old couple living in the same floor. In a remarkably dialog-driven sequence, we feel Carol's enthusiasm to have an extra-time for socializing and Larry's impatience to live and stop enduring Mr. House's collection of stamps. At the end, we're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking, their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism. They have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of "Manhattan", which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film's three titular 'M'. We learn that Carol wants to open a restaurant, Larry believes it's a foolish decision to take so late in life, yet one of their recently divorced friends Ted (Alan Alda) encourages her. We get it; Larry enjoys his life's pacific serenity while Carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it's too late. Many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ, but Allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous "Husbands and Wives" as if he was tired of hostile arguments. He leaves more room for Ted, whose adventurous temperament fits Carol's thirst for newness, not without feeling jealous about that. It's a pivotal, even crucial moment in Carol and Harry's marital life. Yet the title doesn't lie on the film's premise: it's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine. Speaking of the mystery, if the previous scene where they meet the friendly Houses' couple reminded me of "Rosemary's Baby" when Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes met the Castevets, I was even more struck by the plot's similarities when after a night out, Carol and Larry discovers that Mrs. House died of a heart attack. Much more, Mr. House looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a twin-cemetery, raising Carol's suspicion. "She had a heart condition," he says, Carol insists that Mrs. House never mentioned that. At that point, we know what she's about, she smells something fishy and whether she's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills. And the difference of attitudes between Carol and Larry is the film's comedic basis. Indeed, the conflict between Carol who wants to go further and Larry who wants her to stop, will originate one of Woody Allen's funniest lines: "Is that what you do when I'm forbidding? I'm not going to forbid you a lot, if you do". The greatest delight of "Manhattan Murder Mystery" relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa. Carol's amateurish investigation, her growing complicity with Ted, and Larry's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril, are magnificently portrayed. And all these interactions culminate with the help of Marcia Fox, played by a scene-stealing Angelica Huston, a dark and sensual authoress and professional poker-player, so intuitive that she'll even steal Carol's thunder in the crime- solving process, and fascinate both Ted and Larry. As a counterpart to Carol's personality, like Ted for Larry, Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After, "Husbands and Wives", a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow, "Manhattan Murder Mystery" feels like a moment of pure refreshment. If it's not the best of Woody Allen's rich filmography, not nominated for a Best Original Screenplay or Best Supporting Acting Oscar (while it deserved some accolades) it's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we'd expect from Woody Allen. And the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely Diane Keaton's comeback and her incredible chemistry with Woody Allen. Indeed, I have much admiration to Mia Farrow, and she'll be forever associated with some of Allen's greatest achievements, but there has always been a sort of inner sweetness in Farrow that confined to poignancy and even sometimes to pathos, and this characteristic reaches a paroxysm in "Husbands and Wives" where not only her character, but the actress herself looked both unhappy, embodying the marital conflict that was poisoning their lives. Woody Allen said "Mia likes to do funny things, but she's not as broad a comedian as Diane is", although I don't approve the manner but I have to agree with the director, Mia Farrow is fine but as far as comedy is concerned, Diane Keaton has that little sparkle that makes all the difference. Yes, we have the New York middle-class lifestyle, the intellectual discussions with the couples of friends, Allen's neurotic personality ("a dead body and claustrophobia, a neurotic's jackpot"), his distaste for Wagner, a compositor who gives him the "urge to invade Poland" and the whole romantic twists and commentaries on men and women's relationships, all the ingredients for a great Allen's film are here but Diane Keaton is the icing on the cake. And believe me, she's for more than three quarters in what make "Manhattan Murder Mystery" such a delicious pastry, reminding us how a great chemistry she always had with Woody Allen, hell, even when they argue, they're hilarious.

This is probably one reason why it enabled Woody Allen to show his cinematographic preferences in this film by including numerous important scenes from his favorite Hollywood films.

    With having found myself over the last few months unwittingly putting films of Woody Allen right at the back of the line of my "must watch" pile of movies,I decided shortly after finding out that a poll for the best films of 1993 was being held on IMDb's Classic Film board,that I would instantly put Woody Allen's 1993 right at the front,so that I could at last uncover the mysterious Manhattan murder. The plot: Returning to their apartment building after watching a game of hookey, husband and wife Larry and Carol Lipton run into near by residents,and fellow husband and wife,Paul and Lilian House.Making small talk with Paul and Lilian as they find themselves in the building's elevator with them,Larry and Carol are caught by surprise when Paul and Lilian suddenly invite them round for a late night coffee.Ignoring her husbands less then subtle signs of annoyance,Carol accepts the House's kind offer. As Larry gets bored out of existence by Paul showing him all of his stamp collection,Carol finds every minute that she spends with Lilian to be a true joy,who along with having a similar craving that Carol has for French deserts,is also very keen on her at- home gym,which leads to Carol greatly admiring Lilian,due to how amazingly fit and healthy she looks. The next night: Coming back from a night spent at the opera,Carol and Paul's fun night is stopped in its tracks,when they are given the tragic news the earlier that night,Lilian House had died of a heart attack.Feeling shaken over not just the death of her friend,but also the very odd,calm manner that Paul seemed to be in,Carol pushes Larry's reasoning that Paul is just grieving in a "different" manner right to the side,and begins to wonder if the thing that killed Lilian House was really a heart attack,or something much more sinister?... View on the film: Picking up a sub-plot that was originally meant for the duo's 1977 movie Annie Hall that got cut from the script due to feeling out of place with the rest of the plot,the screenplay by Marshall Brickman and co- writer/actor and director auteur Woody Allen impressively keep the movie away from every feeling dusty by cleverly balancing a tightly-coiled, surprisingly thrilling murder-mystery with characters like Carol Lipton,who will go to increasingly insane leginths to prove that their "hunch" is correct. Shooting the film in a "floating", non-shaky Cam style,Allen gives the movie a wonderful fresh atmosphere,with the scenes that Larry and Carol share together having an expert,improve-like feel about them,which helps to give each of Allen's and Brickman's lines (with "I cant listen to that much Wagner ya know.I start to get the urge to invade to conquer Poland!",being a particularly hilarious highlight) a real sharpness. Along with the crisp one-liners,Allen also gives the movie some terrific sly nods to Film Noir,from going to see Double Imdematey at a cinema,to an extremely stylish ending ,that has strong shades of 1947 Orson Welles Film Noir The Lady from Shanghai. Reuniting for the first time since 1979,Woody Allen and Diane Keaton both give strong performance's which set out to prove,that despite not appear on screen together for more than 10 years,neither of them has lost the other ones rhythm.Bounceing off a wonderfully agitated Allen,who would much rather be in bed then going round amateur sleuthing,Keaton shows Carol to be someone with an electrifying,and risky personality,who cant resits keeping away from solving the Manhattan murder mystery.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery marks Woody Allen's return to comedy after several steady years of cranking out dramas with underlying comedic themes. One could look at this film as him giving into the ones who demanded comedy for so many years, as he again creates a character hellbent on perfection and consumed by his petulant neuroses. Looking at this from a more comedic angle than his previous works, this is one of the funniest Woody Allen movies I have yet to see, surpassing even the heavily comedic undertones of works such as Midnight in Paris and Whatever Works. Allen rounds up Diane Keaton again in the leading female role, perfectly replicating the kind of atmosphere he created in Annie Hall, one of his first films to be recognized by even the Academy as a significant achievement in dramatic filmmaking. The two are a couple, named Larry and Carol Lipton, respectively, who are invited to coffee by Paul House (Jerry Adler) and Lilian (Lynn Cohen), who live next door to them in a highrise building. They have a few cups of coffee, as Carol enthusiastically talks with Lilian about her new treadmill, as they are both trying to remain in shape as they approach their elderly years. They leave the apartment not long after and return home to their quiet little sanctuary (mainly so Larry can catch the Bob Hope movie on Television). The next day, after returning home, they see a crowd outside of the House's apartment and find officers and a coroner on scene reporting that Lilian died of a heart attack. This comes as a grand shock to both Larry and Carol seeing as Lilian appeared healthier and more active than folks half her age, but it comes as a greater shock to Carol that the next day upon seeing Paul that he doesn't seem burdened or even upset by the sudden death of his wife. This sends Carol into a Nancy Drew-like frenzy, sneaking into the House's apartment, invading their privacy, and completely going overboard in her amateur investigation. Larry becomes frustrated at Carol's childish, intrusive behavior, but becomes more concerned when he notices that their friend Ted (Alan Alda) becomes entangled with the "mystery" at hand here and is getting awfully close to his wife. He realizes that in order to try and even continue a relationship with this woman that he'll need to play along and overall regain her attention. This is when Manhattan Murder Mystery becomes more about love and passion (or lack thereof) than it does the inherent murder and/or mystery. We see that Carol is doing this Nancy Drew investigation not to irritate or intimidate her husband, but almost as a way to cope with a dying, less successful marriage. This is her only outlet of excitement in an increasingly bitter world. Woody Allen marinated in the field of drama so long that American audiences thought he lacked the skills and the ability to make a compelling, silly, ribald comedy. Consider those audiences served by the filmmaking desperado himself. Allen delivers not only a funny, but a terrifically engrossing drama about the dying spark in a once prosperous marital relationship and the ridiculous methods one will use as a catalyst in desperate times. Allen and Keaton, once more, put on a fabulous show, giving us believable characters to enjoy watching, and side characters such as Jerry Adler and Alan Alda are fun to watch and provide grand entertainment. This is one of the strongest comedies Allen has ever made, way more competent that one of his odes to slapstick. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Jerry Adler, and Lynn Cohen. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    A middle-aged couple (Woody Allen and Diane Keaton) suspects foul play when their neighbor's wife suddenly drops dead. You know, how many films can you do about loving New York starring Woody Allen and Diane Keaton? Apparently a fair amount, as this film is one more on the pile -- and it is a pile of winners. Sure, you have Zach Braff's film debut that probably never should have happened, but that is forgivable. Who killed the neighbor? Why? Did anyone kill her? And then, is she even dead? This truly is a mystery, with ample amounts of comedy thrown in. And, because it is Woody humor, it is brilliant with its blend of easy jokes and more intellectual jabs (such as the reference to invading Poland while listening to Wagner).

    After 20 years of marriage, and with one son in college, Larry (Woody Allen) and Carol Lipton (Diane Keaton) try to accommodate with each other's interests, and from the very first hilarious exchanges, we get the point on how dramatically opposed they happen to be. To give you an idea, Larry loves watching ice hockey games while Carol prefers to listen to Wagner; she loves Manhattan's nightlife while he'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed. The differences between Carol and Larry get more obvious when they meet Mr. and Mrs. House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen), an old couple living in the same floor. In a remarkably dialog-driven sequence, we feel Carol's enthusiasm to have an extra-time for socializing and Larry's impatience to live and stop enduring Mr. House's collection of stamps. At the end, we're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking, their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism. They have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of "Manhattan", which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film's three titular 'M'. We learn that Carol wants to open a restaurant, Larry believes it's a foolish decision to take so late in life, yet one of their recently divorced friends Ted (Alan Alda) encourages her. We get it; Larry enjoys his life's pacific serenity while Carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it's too late. Many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ, but Allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous "Husbands and Wives" as if he was tired of hostile arguments. He leaves more room for Ted, whose adventurous temperament fits Carol's thirst for newness, not without feeling jealous about that. It's a pivotal, even crucial moment in Carol and Harry's marital life. Yet the title doesn't lie on the film's premise: it's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine. Speaking of the mystery, if the previous scene where they meet the friendly Houses' couple reminded me of "Rosemary's Baby" when Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes met the Castevets, I was even more struck by the plot's similarities when after a night out, Carol and Larry discovers that Mrs. House died of a heart attack. Much more, Mr. House looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a twin-cemetery, raising Carol's suspicion. "She had a heart condition," he says, Carol insists that Mrs. House never mentioned that. At that point, we know what she's about, she smells something fishy and whether she's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills. And the difference of attitudes between Carol and Larry is the film's comedic basis. Indeed, the conflict between Carol who wants to go further and Larry who wants her to stop, will originate one of Woody Allen's funniest lines: "Is that what you do when I'm forbidding? I'm not going to forbid you a lot, if you do". The greatest delight of "Manhattan Murder Mystery" relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa. Carol's amateurish investigation, her growing complicity with Ted, and Larry's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril, are magnificently portrayed. And all these interactions culminate with the help of Marcia Fox, played by a scene-stealing Angelica Huston, a dark and sensual authoress and professional poker-player, so intuitive that she'll even steal Carol's thunder in the crime- solving process, and fascinate both Ted and Larry. As a counterpart to Carol's personality, like Ted for Larry, Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After, "Husbands and Wives", a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow, "Manhattan Murder Mystery" feels like a moment of pure refreshment. If it's not the best of Woody Allen's rich filmography, not nominated for a Best Original Screenplay or Best Supporting Acting Oscar (while it deserved some accolades) it's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we'd expect from Woody Allen. And the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely Diane Keaton's comeback and her incredible chemistry with Woody Allen. Indeed, I have much admiration to Mia Farrow, and she'll be forever associated with some of Allen's greatest achievements, but there has always been a sort of inner sweetness in Farrow that confined to poignancy and even sometimes to pathos, and this characteristic reaches a paroxysm in "Husbands and Wives" where not only her character, but the actress herself looked both unhappy, embodying the marital conflict that was poisoning their lives. Woody Allen said "Mia likes to do funny things, but she's not as broad a comedian as Diane is", although I don't approve the manner but I have to agree with the director, Mia Farrow is fine but as far as comedy is concerned, Diane Keaton has that little sparkle that makes all the difference. Yes, we have the New York middle-class lifestyle, the intellectual discussions with the couples of friends, Allen's neurotic personality ("a dead body and claustrophobia, a neurotic's jackpot"), his distaste for Wagner, a compositor who gives him the "urge to invade Poland" and the whole romantic twists and commentaries on men and women's relationships, all the ingredients for a great Allen's film are here but Diane Keaton is the icing on the cake. And believe me, she's for more than three quarters in what make "Manhattan Murder Mystery" such a delicious pastry, reminding us how a great chemistry she always had with Woody Allen, hell, even when they argue, they're hilarious.

    This frantic comedy, released during the tumultuous tabloid scandal between Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, is co-scripted by Marshall Brickman, Allen's writing partner for MANHATTAN and ANNIE HALL. ANNIE HALL was originally conceived as a murder mystery before reimagined as the rom-com we know and love, and here's a double-whammy collaboration: Diane Keaton, Woody's co-star/love interest during the seventies, returns to the iconic director's canon. And the results are disastrous. Allen and Keaton play a THIN MAN "Nick and Nora" like couple who meet their elderly neighbors  a seemingly normal stamp collecting coot and his talkative wife. The wife dies and the husband doesn't seem very jaded. Keaton, overacting desperately, investigates the possible murder, which at first seems a long shot. When she's not tailing the accused through the New York, or teaming up with her charming friend Alan Alda, the film consists of tedious dialog between Allen and Keaton, whose chemistry is, to quote Alvy Singer in ANNIE HALL, "A dead shark." Woody Allen delivers flat one-liners like a sleepy clown after the circus has let out. And when the convoluted mystery is solved there's still twenty minutes to figure out what exactly? Although the climax, homage to Orson Welle's THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI using actual scenes of the famous Fun House montage, is a clever twist, the rest is a failed class reunion. And even "worse than the chicken at Tresky's." For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com

    This movie started out great but after about an hour and a half (after a body is found) it deteriorates into garbage. Woody still managed to make me laugh from time to time but sorry a lot of this film was contrived and badly written and not like the Woody Allen I remember. These aging actors just can't convincingly pull off badly scripted marital jealousies and drama. Seriously at 57 (the age of Allen in film) he is wondering how often a couple should have sex? Only it is not supposed to be funny in that way. The worst part is the parody of a film noir murder mystery deteriorates into a frenetic unbelievable tired terrible last half hour. At least good film noir mysteries had captivating and somewhat believable stories this film did not. It is not funny it is nothing but boring and contrived. These aged reunions are usually a depressing flop and this was no exception.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) This movie almost defines delightful--at least for people who already like Woody Allen. (For some, Allen will always be irritating, no matter how brilliant the movie.) Without a shred of pretension, and without really any suspense in the usual murder mystery way, we get sucked into what is perhaps the most believable of murder mysteries ever. The reason is simple. It's told as if two very ordinary, slightly bookish, not so slightly neurotic New Yorkers stumble on a murder. It's the story of what we would all do if we thought our neighbor had murdered his wife. The bumbling, the doubts, the revelations, the sneaking around, the giggling. It helps (a lot) that we have the reuniting of Allen with Diane Keaton, and it's a nice breeze in the room to have both Alan Alda at his ordinary guy best and Angelica Huston as a true New Yorker brimming with confidence and savvy. (Huston is from California, a daughter in the famous movie family. Alda, nicely enough, is a New Yorker for real.) Don't expect anything deep, hilarious, or clever (three of the many intentions in Allen's movies). But it's really well made, superbly written, acted with utter believability, paced with snap, and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period (set designer, photographer, editor, etc.), almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first place--a Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein. I loved it.

    This is a very good movie. It could have been a classic if only it had been done by someone else. Woody Allen is an excellent comic whose character is well established. I was a fan of his stand up routines on Ed Sullivan's show many years ago. I like most of his movies. This movie is more than just watchable. It is quite enjoyable, but... If Sir Alfred had done this same basic story with the Hitchcock air of suspense and some haunting music and a cast of someone like James Stewart or Cary Grant and Doris Day (as she was in The Man Who Knew Too Much or Midnight Lace, or keep Diane Keaton and lose the one liners)it could have been better. It needs a little comedy but not rat a tat funny lines that sound like a routine. I think I read somewhere that Cary Grant and James Stewart are not answering their phones now, but there must be someone in Hollywood who could fill parts of their shoes. Matt Damon or Mark Wahlberg or Matthew Broderick as the person suddenly drug into a mystery. Nicolas Cage maybe. Christina Applegate. Michelle Pfeiffer. It could still have a bit of comedy but more mystery and perhaps a younger lady in the role of the heart attack victim so there is a bit of doubt. I'm just sayin'. And does it have to be Manhatten? Frisco Murder Mystery... Muscle Beach Murder Mystery... Calumet City Murder Mystery...

    Manhattan Murder Mystery is considered an important film in Woody Allen's long and illustrious cinematographic career as it is an exemplary proof of his faithfulness to Manhattan and people who live over there. As he knows both of them very well, more than a suspense thriller, his film appears as an acute observation of Manhattan people. The viewer is shown what Manhattan is and what type of people inhabit this area which has the reputation of being one of New York city's best known addresses. The film is replete with typically Woody Allen style humor which consists of short and witty remarks about people and their idiosyncrasies. For this reason, director Woody Allen created his own alter ego in the form of Larry Lipton, an intellectual editor who seems to be getting closer to a young woman as his wife is getting much too curious about a death which happened in their neighborhood. Emotional problems between husbands and wives occupy a good deal of screen space in Woody Allen's films. This is also the case with this film as its numerous subplots deal with the emotional turmoil of men and women. Lastly, there is something enigmatic about movie titles as there are times when viewers don't get to see much of what is described in the title. Judging from that yardstick, Manhattan Murder Mystery tries hard to cash on to that obsession and also succeeds. This is probably one reason why it enabled Woody Allen to show his cinematographic preferences in this film by including numerous important scenes from his favorite Hollywood films.

To give you an idea, Larry loves watching ice hockey games while Carol prefers to listen to Wagner; she loves Manhattan's nightlife while he'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed. The differences between Carol and Larry get more obvious when they meet Mr. and Mrs. House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen), an old couple living in the same floor. In a remarkably dialog-driven sequence, we feel Carol's enthusiasm to have an extra-time for socializing and Larry's impatience to live and stop enduring Mr. House's collection of stamps. At the end, we're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking, their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism. They have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of "Manhattan", which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film's three titular 'M'. We learn that Carol wants to open a restaurant, Larry believes it's a foolish decision to take so late in life, yet one of their recently divorced friends Ted (Alan Alda) encourages her. We get it; Larry enjoys his life's pacific serenity while Carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it's too late. Many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ, but Allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous "Husbands and Wives" as if he was tired of hostile arguments. He leaves more room for Ted, whose adventurous temperament fits Carol's thirst for newness, not without feeling jealous about that. It's a pivotal, even crucial moment in Carol and Harry's marital life. Yet the title doesn't lie on the film's premise: it's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine. Speaking of the mystery, if the previous scene where they meet the friendly Houses' couple reminded me of "Rosemary's Baby" when Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes met the Castevets, I was even more struck by the plot's similarities when after a night out, Carol and Larry discovers that Mrs. House died of a heart attack. Much more, Mr. House looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a twin-cemetery, raising Carol's suspicion. "She had a heart condition," he says, Carol insists that Mrs. House never mentioned that. At that point, we know what she's about, she smells something fishy and whether she's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills. And the difference of attitudes between Carol and Larry is the film's comedic basis. Indeed, the conflict between Carol who wants to go further and Larry who wants her to stop, will originate one of Woody Allen's funniest lines: "Is that what you do when I'm forbidding? I'm not going to forbid you a lot, if you do". The greatest delight of "Manhattan Murder Mystery" relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa. Carol's amateurish investigation, her growing complicity with Ted, and Larry's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril, are magnificently portrayed. And all these interactions culminate with the help of Marcia Fox, played by a scene-stealing Angelica Huston, a dark and sensual authoress and professional poker-player, so intuitive that she'll even steal Carol's thunder in the crime- solving process, and fascinate both Ted and Larry. As a counterpart to Carol's personality, like Ted for Larry, Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After, "Husbands and Wives", a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow, "Manhattan Murder Mystery" feels like a moment of pure refreshment. If it's not the best of Woody Allen's rich filmography, not nominated for a Best Original Screenplay or Best Supporting Acting Oscar (while it deserved some accolades) it's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we'd expect from Woody Allen. And the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely Diane Keaton's comeback and her incredible chemistry with Woody Allen. Indeed, I have much admiration to Mia Farrow, and she'll be forever associated with some of Allen's greatest achievements, but there has always been a sort of inner sweetness in Farrow that confined to poignancy and even sometimes to pathos, and this characteristic reaches a paroxysm in "Husbands and Wives" where not only her character, but the actress herself looked both unhappy, embodying the marital conflict that was poisoning their lives. Woody Allen said "Mia likes to do funny things, but she's not as broad a comedian as Diane is", although I don't approve the manner but I have to agree with the director, Mia Farrow is fine but as far as comedy is concerned, Diane Keaton has that little sparkle that makes all the difference. Yes, we have the New York middle-class lifestyle, the intellectual discussions with the couples of friends, Allen's neurotic personality ("a dead body and claustrophobia, a neurotic's jackpot"), his distaste for Wagner, a compositor who gives him the "urge to invade Poland" and the whole romantic twists and commentaries on men and women's relationships, all the ingredients for a great Allen's film are here but Diane Keaton is the icing on the cake. And believe me, she's for more than three quarters in what make "Manhattan Murder Mystery" such a delicious pastry, reminding us how a great chemistry she always had with Woody Allen, hell, even when they argue, they're hilarious.

    This frantic comedy, released during the tumultuous tabloid scandal between Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, is co-scripted by Marshall Brickman, Allen's writing partner for MANHATTAN and ANNIE HALL. ANNIE HALL was originally conceived as a murder mystery before reimagined as the rom-com we know and love, and here's a double-whammy collaboration: Diane Keaton, Woody's co-star/love interest during the seventies, returns to the iconic director's canon. And the results are disastrous. Allen and Keaton play a THIN MAN "Nick and Nora" like couple who meet their elderly neighbors  a seemingly normal stamp collecting coot and his talkative wife. The wife dies and the husband doesn't seem very jaded. Keaton, overacting desperately, investigates the possible murder, which at first seems a long shot. When she's not tailing the accused through the New York, or teaming up with her charming friend Alan Alda, the film consists of tedious dialog between Allen and Keaton, whose chemistry is, to quote Alvy Singer in ANNIE HALL, "A dead shark." Woody Allen delivers flat one-liners like a sleepy clown after the circus has let out. And when the convoluted mystery is solved there's still twenty minutes to figure out what exactly? Although the climax, homage to Orson Welle's THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI using actual scenes of the famous Fun House montage, is a clever twist, the rest is a failed class reunion. And even "worse than the chicken at Tresky's." For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com

    This movie started out great but after about an hour and a half (after a body is found) it deteriorates into garbage. Woody still managed to make me laugh from time to time but sorry a lot of this film was contrived and badly written and not like the Woody Allen I remember. These aging actors just can't convincingly pull off badly scripted marital jealousies and drama. Seriously at 57 (the age of Allen in film) he is wondering how often a couple should have sex? Only it is not supposed to be funny in that way. The worst part is the parody of a film noir murder mystery deteriorates into a frenetic unbelievable tired terrible last half hour. At least good film noir mysteries had captivating and somewhat believable stories this film did not. It is not funny it is nothing but boring and contrived. These aged reunions are usually a depressing flop and this was no exception.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) This movie almost defines delightful--at least for people who already like Woody Allen. (For some, Allen will always be irritating, no matter how brilliant the movie.) Without a shred of pretension, and without really any suspense in the usual murder mystery way, we get sucked into what is perhaps the most believable of murder mysteries ever. The reason is simple. It's told as if two very ordinary, slightly bookish, not so slightly neurotic New Yorkers stumble on a murder. It's the story of what we would all do if we thought our neighbor had murdered his wife. The bumbling, the doubts, the revelations, the sneaking around, the giggling. It helps (a lot) that we have the reuniting of Allen with Diane Keaton, and it's a nice breeze in the room to have both Alan Alda at his ordinary guy best and Angelica Huston as a true New Yorker brimming with confidence and savvy. (Huston is from California, a daughter in the famous movie family. Alda, nicely enough, is a New Yorker for real.) Don't expect anything deep, hilarious, or clever (three of the many intentions in Allen's movies). But it's really well made, superbly written, acted with utter believability, paced with snap, and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period (set designer, photographer, editor, etc.), almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first place--a Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein. I loved it.

    This is a very good movie. It could have been a classic if only it had been done by someone else. Woody Allen is an excellent comic whose character is well established. I was a fan of his stand up routines on Ed Sullivan's show many years ago. I like most of his movies. This movie is more than just watchable. It is quite enjoyable, but... If Sir Alfred had done this same basic story with the Hitchcock air of suspense and some haunting music and a cast of someone like James Stewart or Cary Grant and Doris Day (as she was in The Man Who Knew Too Much or Midnight Lace, or keep Diane Keaton and lose the one liners)it could have been better. It needs a little comedy but not rat a tat funny lines that sound like a routine. I think I read somewhere that Cary Grant and James Stewart are not answering their phones now, but there must be someone in Hollywood who could fill parts of their shoes. Matt Damon or Mark Wahlberg or Matthew Broderick as the person suddenly drug into a mystery. Nicolas Cage maybe. Christina Applegate. Michelle Pfeiffer. It could still have a bit of comedy but more mystery and perhaps a younger lady in the role of the heart attack victim so there is a bit of doubt. I'm just sayin'. And does it have to be Manhatten? Frisco Murder Mystery... Muscle Beach Murder Mystery... Calumet City Murder Mystery...

    Manhattan Murder Mystery is considered an important film in Woody Allen's long and illustrious cinematographic career as it is an exemplary proof of his faithfulness to Manhattan and people who live over there. As he knows both of them very well, more than a suspense thriller, his film appears as an acute observation of Manhattan people. The viewer is shown what Manhattan is and what type of people inhabit this area which has the reputation of being one of New York city's best known addresses. The film is replete with typically Woody Allen style humor which consists of short and witty remarks about people and their idiosyncrasies. For this reason, director Woody Allen created his own alter ego in the form of Larry Lipton, an intellectual editor who seems to be getting closer to a young woman as his wife is getting much too curious about a death which happened in their neighborhood. Emotional problems between husbands and wives occupy a good deal of screen space in Woody Allen's films. This is also the case with this film as its numerous subplots deal with the emotional turmoil of men and women. Lastly, there is something enigmatic about movie titles as there are times when viewers don't get to see much of what is described in the title. Judging from that yardstick, Manhattan Murder Mystery tries hard to cash on to that obsession and also succeeds. This is probably one reason why it enabled Woody Allen to show his cinematographic preferences in this film by including numerous important scenes from his favorite Hollywood films.

    With having found myself over the last few months unwittingly putting films of Woody Allen right at the back of the line of my "must watch" pile of movies,I decided shortly after finding out that a poll for the best films of 1993 was being held on IMDb's Classic Film board,that I would instantly put Woody Allen's 1993 right at the front,so that I could at last uncover the mysterious Manhattan murder. The plot: Returning to their apartment building after watching a game of hookey, husband and wife Larry and Carol Lipton run into near by residents,and fellow husband and wife,Paul and Lilian House.Making small talk with Paul and Lilian as they find themselves in the building's elevator with them,Larry and Carol are caught by surprise when Paul and Lilian suddenly invite them round for a late night coffee.Ignoring her husbands less then subtle signs of annoyance,Carol accepts the House's kind offer. As Larry gets bored out of existence by Paul showing him all of his stamp collection,Carol finds every minute that she spends with Lilian to be a true joy,who along with having a similar craving that Carol has for French deserts,is also very keen on her at- home gym,which leads to Carol greatly admiring Lilian,due to how amazingly fit and healthy she looks. The next night: Coming back from a night spent at the opera,Carol and Paul's fun night is stopped in its tracks,when they are given the tragic news the earlier that night,Lilian House had died of a heart attack.Feeling shaken over not just the death of her friend,but also the very odd,calm manner that Paul seemed to be in,Carol pushes Larry's reasoning that Paul is just grieving in a "different" manner right to the side,and begins to wonder if the thing that killed Lilian House was really a heart attack,or something much more sinister?... View on the film: Picking up a sub-plot that was originally meant for the duo's 1977 movie Annie Hall that got cut from the script due to feeling out of place with the rest of the plot,the screenplay by Marshall Brickman and co- writer/actor and director auteur Woody Allen impressively keep the movie away from every feeling dusty by cleverly balancing a tightly-coiled, surprisingly thrilling murder-mystery with characters like Carol Lipton,who will go to increasingly insane leginths to prove that their "hunch" is correct. Shooting the film in a "floating", non-shaky Cam style,Allen gives the movie a wonderful fresh atmosphere,with the scenes that Larry and Carol share together having an expert,improve-like feel about them,which helps to give each of Allen's and Brickman's lines (with "I cant listen to that much Wagner ya know.I start to get the urge to invade to conquer Poland!",being a particularly hilarious highlight) a real sharpness. Along with the crisp one-liners,Allen also gives the movie some terrific sly nods to Film Noir,from going to see Double Imdematey at a cinema,to an extremely stylish ending ,that has strong shades of 1947 Orson Welles Film Noir The Lady from Shanghai. Reuniting for the first time since 1979,Woody Allen and Diane Keaton both give strong performance's which set out to prove,that despite not appear on screen together for more than 10 years,neither of them has lost the other ones rhythm.Bounceing off a wonderfully agitated Allen,who would much rather be in bed then going round amateur sleuthing,Keaton shows Carol to be someone with an electrifying,and risky personality,who cant resits keeping away from solving the Manhattan murder mystery.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery marks Woody Allen's return to comedy after several steady years of cranking out dramas with underlying comedic themes. One could look at this film as him giving into the ones who demanded comedy for so many years, as he again creates a character hellbent on perfection and consumed by his petulant neuroses. Looking at this from a more comedic angle than his previous works, this is one of the funniest Woody Allen movies I have yet to see, surpassing even the heavily comedic undertones of works such as Midnight in Paris and Whatever Works. Allen rounds up Diane Keaton again in the leading female role, perfectly replicating the kind of atmosphere he created in Annie Hall, one of his first films to be recognized by even the Academy as a significant achievement in dramatic filmmaking. The two are a couple, named Larry and Carol Lipton, respectively, who are invited to coffee by Paul House (Jerry Adler) and Lilian (Lynn Cohen), who live next door to them in a highrise building. They have a few cups of coffee, as Carol enthusiastically talks with Lilian about her new treadmill, as they are both trying to remain in shape as they approach their elderly years. They leave the apartment not long after and return home to their quiet little sanctuary (mainly so Larry can catch the Bob Hope movie on Television). The next day, after returning home, they see a crowd outside of the House's apartment and find officers and a coroner on scene reporting that Lilian died of a heart attack. This comes as a grand shock to both Larry and Carol seeing as Lilian appeared healthier and more active than folks half her age, but it comes as a greater shock to Carol that the next day upon seeing Paul that he doesn't seem burdened or even upset by the sudden death of his wife. This sends Carol into a Nancy Drew-like frenzy, sneaking into the House's apartment, invading their privacy, and completely going overboard in her amateur investigation. Larry becomes frustrated at Carol's childish, intrusive behavior, but becomes more concerned when he notices that their friend Ted (Alan Alda) becomes entangled with the "mystery" at hand here and is getting awfully close to his wife. He realizes that in order to try and even continue a relationship with this woman that he'll need to play along and overall regain her attention. This is when Manhattan Murder Mystery becomes more about love and passion (or lack thereof) than it does the inherent murder and/or mystery. We see that Carol is doing this Nancy Drew investigation not to irritate or intimidate her husband, but almost as a way to cope with a dying, less successful marriage. This is her only outlet of excitement in an increasingly bitter world. Woody Allen marinated in the field of drama so long that American audiences thought he lacked the skills and the ability to make a compelling, silly, ribald comedy. Consider those audiences served by the filmmaking desperado himself. Allen delivers not only a funny, but a terrifically engrossing drama about the dying spark in a once prosperous marital relationship and the ridiculous methods one will use as a catalyst in desperate times. Allen and Keaton, once more, put on a fabulous show, giving us believable characters to enjoy watching, and side characters such as Jerry Adler and Alan Alda are fun to watch and provide grand entertainment. This is one of the strongest comedies Allen has ever made, way more competent that one of his odes to slapstick. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Jerry Adler, and Lynn Cohen. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    A middle-aged couple (Woody Allen and Diane Keaton) suspects foul play when their neighbor's wife suddenly drops dead. You know, how many films can you do about loving New York starring Woody Allen and Diane Keaton? Apparently a fair amount, as this film is one more on the pile -- and it is a pile of winners. Sure, you have Zach Braff's film debut that probably never should have happened, but that is forgivable. Who killed the neighbor? Why? Did anyone kill her? And then, is she even dead? This truly is a mystery, with ample amounts of comedy thrown in. And, because it is Woody humor, it is brilliant with its blend of easy jokes and more intellectual jabs (such as the reference to invading Poland while listening to Wagner).

As a counterpart to Carol's personality, like Ted for Larry, Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After, "Husbands and Wives", a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow, "Manhattan Murder Mystery" feels like a moment of pure refreshment.

(For some, Allen will always be irritating, no matter how brilliant the movie.) Without a shred of pretension, and without really any suspense in the usual murder mystery way, we get sucked into what is perhaps the most believable of murder mysteries ever. The reason is simple. It's told as if two very ordinary, slightly bookish, not so slightly neurotic New Yorkers stumble on a murder. It's the story of what we would all do if we thought our neighbor had murdered his wife. The bumbling, the doubts, the revelations, the sneaking around, the giggling. It helps (a lot) that we have the reuniting of Allen with Diane Keaton, and it's a nice breeze in the room to have both Alan Alda at his ordinary guy best and Angelica Huston as a true New Yorker brimming with confidence and savvy. (Huston is from California, a daughter in the famous movie family. Alda, nicely enough, is a New Yorker for real.) Don't expect anything deep, hilarious, or clever (three of the many intentions in Allen's movies). But it's really well made, superbly written, acted with utter believability, paced with snap, and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period (set designer, photographer, editor, etc.), almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first place--a Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein. I loved it.

    This is a very good movie. It could have been a classic if only it had been done by someone else. Woody Allen is an excellent comic whose character is well established. I was a fan of his stand up routines on Ed Sullivan's show many years ago. I like most of his movies. This movie is more than just watchable. It is quite enjoyable, but... If Sir Alfred had done this same basic story with the Hitchcock air of suspense and some haunting music and a cast of someone like James Stewart or Cary Grant and Doris Day (as she was in The Man Who Knew Too Much or Midnight Lace, or keep Diane Keaton and lose the one liners)it could have been better. It needs a little comedy but not rat a tat funny lines that sound like a routine. I think I read somewhere that Cary Grant and James Stewart are not answering their phones now, but there must be someone in Hollywood who could fill parts of their shoes. Matt Damon or Mark Wahlberg or Matthew Broderick as the person suddenly drug into a mystery. Nicolas Cage maybe. Christina Applegate. Michelle Pfeiffer. It could still have a bit of comedy but more mystery and perhaps a younger lady in the role of the heart attack victim so there is a bit of doubt. I'm just sayin'. And does it have to be Manhatten? Frisco Murder Mystery... Muscle Beach Murder Mystery... Calumet City Murder Mystery...

    Manhattan Murder Mystery is considered an important film in Woody Allen's long and illustrious cinematographic career as it is an exemplary proof of his faithfulness to Manhattan and people who live over there. As he knows both of them very well, more than a suspense thriller, his film appears as an acute observation of Manhattan people. The viewer is shown what Manhattan is and what type of people inhabit this area which has the reputation of being one of New York city's best known addresses. The film is replete with typically Woody Allen style humor which consists of short and witty remarks about people and their idiosyncrasies. For this reason, director Woody Allen created his own alter ego in the form of Larry Lipton, an intellectual editor who seems to be getting closer to a young woman as his wife is getting much too curious about a death which happened in their neighborhood. Emotional problems between husbands and wives occupy a good deal of screen space in Woody Allen's films. This is also the case with this film as its numerous subplots deal with the emotional turmoil of men and women. Lastly, there is something enigmatic about movie titles as there are times when viewers don't get to see much of what is described in the title. Judging from that yardstick, Manhattan Murder Mystery tries hard to cash on to that obsession and also succeeds. This is probably one reason why it enabled Woody Allen to show his cinematographic preferences in this film by including numerous important scenes from his favorite Hollywood films.

    With having found myself over the last few months unwittingly putting films of Woody Allen right at the back of the line of my "must watch" pile of movies,I decided shortly after finding out that a poll for the best films of 1993 was being held on IMDb's Classic Film board,that I would instantly put Woody Allen's 1993 right at the front,so that I could at last uncover the mysterious Manhattan murder. The plot: Returning to their apartment building after watching a game of hookey, husband and wife Larry and Carol Lipton run into near by residents,and fellow husband and wife,Paul and Lilian House.Making small talk with Paul and Lilian as they find themselves in the building's elevator with them,Larry and Carol are caught by surprise when Paul and Lilian suddenly invite them round for a late night coffee.Ignoring her husbands less then subtle signs of annoyance,Carol accepts the House's kind offer. As Larry gets bored out of existence by Paul showing him all of his stamp collection,Carol finds every minute that she spends with Lilian to be a true joy,who along with having a similar craving that Carol has for French deserts,is also very keen on her at- home gym,which leads to Carol greatly admiring Lilian,due to how amazingly fit and healthy she looks. The next night: Coming back from a night spent at the opera,Carol and Paul's fun night is stopped in its tracks,when they are given the tragic news the earlier that night,Lilian House had died of a heart attack.Feeling shaken over not just the death of her friend,but also the very odd,calm manner that Paul seemed to be in,Carol pushes Larry's reasoning that Paul is just grieving in a "different" manner right to the side,and begins to wonder if the thing that killed Lilian House was really a heart attack,or something much more sinister?... View on the film: Picking up a sub-plot that was originally meant for the duo's 1977 movie Annie Hall that got cut from the script due to feeling out of place with the rest of the plot,the screenplay by Marshall Brickman and co- writer/actor and director auteur Woody Allen impressively keep the movie away from every feeling dusty by cleverly balancing a tightly-coiled, surprisingly thrilling murder-mystery with characters like Carol Lipton,who will go to increasingly insane leginths to prove that their "hunch" is correct. Shooting the film in a "floating", non-shaky Cam style,Allen gives the movie a wonderful fresh atmosphere,with the scenes that Larry and Carol share together having an expert,improve-like feel about them,which helps to give each of Allen's and Brickman's lines (with "I cant listen to that much Wagner ya know.I start to get the urge to invade to conquer Poland!",being a particularly hilarious highlight) a real sharpness. Along with the crisp one-liners,Allen also gives the movie some terrific sly nods to Film Noir,from going to see Double Imdematey at a cinema,to an extremely stylish ending ,that has strong shades of 1947 Orson Welles Film Noir The Lady from Shanghai. Reuniting for the first time since 1979,Woody Allen and Diane Keaton both give strong performance's which set out to prove,that despite not appear on screen together for more than 10 years,neither of them has lost the other ones rhythm.Bounceing off a wonderfully agitated Allen,who would much rather be in bed then going round amateur sleuthing,Keaton shows Carol to be someone with an electrifying,and risky personality,who cant resits keeping away from solving the Manhattan murder mystery.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery marks Woody Allen's return to comedy after several steady years of cranking out dramas with underlying comedic themes. One could look at this film as him giving into the ones who demanded comedy for so many years, as he again creates a character hellbent on perfection and consumed by his petulant neuroses. Looking at this from a more comedic angle than his previous works, this is one of the funniest Woody Allen movies I have yet to see, surpassing even the heavily comedic undertones of works such as Midnight in Paris and Whatever Works. Allen rounds up Diane Keaton again in the leading female role, perfectly replicating the kind of atmosphere he created in Annie Hall, one of his first films to be recognized by even the Academy as a significant achievement in dramatic filmmaking. The two are a couple, named Larry and Carol Lipton, respectively, who are invited to coffee by Paul House (Jerry Adler) and Lilian (Lynn Cohen), who live next door to them in a highrise building. They have a few cups of coffee, as Carol enthusiastically talks with Lilian about her new treadmill, as they are both trying to remain in shape as they approach their elderly years. They leave the apartment not long after and return home to their quiet little sanctuary (mainly so Larry can catch the Bob Hope movie on Television). The next day, after returning home, they see a crowd outside of the House's apartment and find officers and a coroner on scene reporting that Lilian died of a heart attack. This comes as a grand shock to both Larry and Carol seeing as Lilian appeared healthier and more active than folks half her age, but it comes as a greater shock to Carol that the next day upon seeing Paul that he doesn't seem burdened or even upset by the sudden death of his wife. This sends Carol into a Nancy Drew-like frenzy, sneaking into the House's apartment, invading their privacy, and completely going overboard in her amateur investigation. Larry becomes frustrated at Carol's childish, intrusive behavior, but becomes more concerned when he notices that their friend Ted (Alan Alda) becomes entangled with the "mystery" at hand here and is getting awfully close to his wife. He realizes that in order to try and even continue a relationship with this woman that he'll need to play along and overall regain her attention. This is when Manhattan Murder Mystery becomes more about love and passion (or lack thereof) than it does the inherent murder and/or mystery. We see that Carol is doing this Nancy Drew investigation not to irritate or intimidate her husband, but almost as a way to cope with a dying, less successful marriage. This is her only outlet of excitement in an increasingly bitter world. Woody Allen marinated in the field of drama so long that American audiences thought he lacked the skills and the ability to make a compelling, silly, ribald comedy. Consider those audiences served by the filmmaking desperado himself. Allen delivers not only a funny, but a terrifically engrossing drama about the dying spark in a once prosperous marital relationship and the ridiculous methods one will use as a catalyst in desperate times. Allen and Keaton, once more, put on a fabulous show, giving us believable characters to enjoy watching, and side characters such as Jerry Adler and Alan Alda are fun to watch and provide grand entertainment. This is one of the strongest comedies Allen has ever made, way more competent that one of his odes to slapstick. Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Jerry Adler, and Lynn Cohen. Directed by: Woody Allen.

    A middle-aged couple (Woody Allen and Diane Keaton) suspects foul play when their neighbor's wife suddenly drops dead. You know, how many films can you do about loving New York starring Woody Allen and Diane Keaton? Apparently a fair amount, as this film is one more on the pile -- and it is a pile of winners. Sure, you have Zach Braff's film debut that probably never should have happened, but that is forgivable. Who killed the neighbor? Why? Did anyone kill her? And then, is she even dead? This truly is a mystery, with ample amounts of comedy thrown in. And, because it is Woody humor, it is brilliant with its blend of easy jokes and more intellectual jabs (such as the reference to invading Poland while listening to Wagner).

    After 20 years of marriage, and with one son in college, Larry (Woody Allen) and Carol Lipton (Diane Keaton) try to accommodate with each other's interests, and from the very first hilarious exchanges, we get the point on how dramatically opposed they happen to be. To give you an idea, Larry loves watching ice hockey games while Carol prefers to listen to Wagner; she loves Manhattan's nightlife while he'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed. The differences between Carol and Larry get more obvious when they meet Mr. and Mrs. House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen), an old couple living in the same floor. In a remarkably dialog-driven sequence, we feel Carol's enthusiasm to have an extra-time for socializing and Larry's impatience to live and stop enduring Mr. House's collection of stamps. At the end, we're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking, their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism. They have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of "Manhattan", which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film's three titular 'M'. We learn that Carol wants to open a restaurant, Larry believes it's a foolish decision to take so late in life, yet one of their recently divorced friends Ted (Alan Alda) encourages her. We get it; Larry enjoys his life's pacific serenity while Carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it's too late. Many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ, but Allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous "Husbands and Wives" as if he was tired of hostile arguments. He leaves more room for Ted, whose adventurous temperament fits Carol's thirst for newness, not without feeling jealous about that. It's a pivotal, even crucial moment in Carol and Harry's marital life. Yet the title doesn't lie on the film's premise: it's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine. Speaking of the mystery, if the previous scene where they meet the friendly Houses' couple reminded me of "Rosemary's Baby" when Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes met the Castevets, I was even more struck by the plot's similarities when after a night out, Carol and Larry discovers that Mrs. House died of a heart attack. Much more, Mr. House looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a twin-cemetery, raising Carol's suspicion. "She had a heart condition," he says, Carol insists that Mrs. House never mentioned that. At that point, we know what she's about, she smells something fishy and whether she's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills. And the difference of attitudes between Carol and Larry is the film's comedic basis. Indeed, the conflict between Carol who wants to go further and Larry who wants her to stop, will originate one of Woody Allen's funniest lines: "Is that what you do when I'm forbidding? I'm not going to forbid you a lot, if you do". The greatest delight of "Manhattan Murder Mystery" relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa. Carol's amateurish investigation, her growing complicity with Ted, and Larry's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril, are magnificently portrayed. And all these interactions culminate with the help of Marcia Fox, played by a scene-stealing Angelica Huston, a dark and sensual authoress and professional poker-player, so intuitive that she'll even steal Carol's thunder in the crime- solving process, and fascinate both Ted and Larry. As a counterpart to Carol's personality, like Ted for Larry, Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After, "Husbands and Wives", a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow, "Manhattan Murder Mystery" feels like a moment of pure refreshment. If it's not the best of Woody Allen's rich filmography, not nominated for a Best Original Screenplay or Best Supporting Acting Oscar (while it deserved some accolades) it's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we'd expect from Woody Allen. And the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely Diane Keaton's comeback and her incredible chemistry with Woody Allen. Indeed, I have much admiration to Mia Farrow, and she'll be forever associated with some of Allen's greatest achievements, but there has always been a sort of inner sweetness in Farrow that confined to poignancy and even sometimes to pathos, and this characteristic reaches a paroxysm in "Husbands and Wives" where not only her character, but the actress herself looked both unhappy, embodying the marital conflict that was poisoning their lives. Woody Allen said "Mia likes to do funny things, but she's not as broad a comedian as Diane is", although I don't approve the manner but I have to agree with the director, Mia Farrow is fine but as far as comedy is concerned, Diane Keaton has that little sparkle that makes all the difference. Yes, we have the New York middle-class lifestyle, the intellectual discussions with the couples of friends, Allen's neurotic personality ("a dead body and claustrophobia, a neurotic's jackpot"), his distaste for Wagner, a compositor who gives him the "urge to invade Poland" and the whole romantic twists and commentaries on men and women's relationships, all the ingredients for a great Allen's film are here but Diane Keaton is the icing on the cake. And believe me, she's for more than three quarters in what make "Manhattan Murder Mystery" such a delicious pastry, reminding us how a great chemistry she always had with Woody Allen, hell, even when they argue, they're hilarious.

    This frantic comedy, released during the tumultuous tabloid scandal between Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, is co-scripted by Marshall Brickman, Allen's writing partner for MANHATTAN and ANNIE HALL. ANNIE HALL was originally conceived as a murder mystery before reimagined as the rom-com we know and love, and here's a double-whammy collaboration: Diane Keaton, Woody's co-star/love interest during the seventies, returns to the iconic director's canon. And the results are disastrous. Allen and Keaton play a THIN MAN "Nick and Nora" like couple who meet their elderly neighbors  a seemingly normal stamp collecting coot and his talkative wife. The wife dies and the husband doesn't seem very jaded. Keaton, overacting desperately, investigates the possible murder, which at first seems a long shot. When she's not tailing the accused through the New York, or teaming up with her charming friend Alan Alda, the film consists of tedious dialog between Allen and Keaton, whose chemistry is, to quote Alvy Singer in ANNIE HALL, "A dead shark." Woody Allen delivers flat one-liners like a sleepy clown after the circus has let out. And when the convoluted mystery is solved there's still twenty minutes to figure out what exactly? Although the climax, homage to Orson Welle's THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI using actual scenes of the famous Fun House montage, is a clever twist, the rest is a failed class reunion. And even "worse than the chicken at Tresky's." For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com

    This movie started out great but after about an hour and a half (after a body is found) it deteriorates into garbage. Woody still managed to make me laugh from time to time but sorry a lot of this film was contrived and badly written and not like the Woody Allen I remember. These aging actors just can't convincingly pull off badly scripted marital jealousies and drama. Seriously at 57 (the age of Allen in film) he is wondering how often a couple should have sex? Only it is not supposed to be funny in that way. The worst part is the parody of a film noir murder mystery deteriorates into a frenetic unbelievable tired terrible last half hour. At least good film noir mysteries had captivating and somewhat believable stories this film did not. It is not funny it is nothing but boring and contrived. These aged reunions are usually a depressing flop and this was no exception.

    Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) This movie almost defines delightful--at least for people who already like Woody Allen. (For some, Allen will always be irritating, no matter how brilliant the movie.) Without a shred of pretension, and without really any suspense in the usual murder mystery way, we get sucked into what is perhaps the most believable of murder mysteries ever. The reason is simple. It's told as if two very ordinary, slightly bookish, not so slightly neurotic New Yorkers stumble on a murder. It's the story of what we would all do if we thought our neighbor had murdered his wife. The bumbling, the doubts, the revelations, the sneaking around, the giggling. It helps (a lot) that we have the reuniting of Allen with Diane Keaton, and it's a nice breeze in the room to have both Alan Alda at his ordinary guy best and Angelica Huston as a true New Yorker brimming with confidence and savvy. (Huston is from California, a daughter in the famous movie family. Alda, nicely enough, is a New Yorker for real.) Don't expect anything deep, hilarious, or clever (three of the many intentions in Allen's movies). But it's really well made, superbly written, acted with utter believability, paced with snap, and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period (set designer, photographer, editor, etc.), almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first place--a Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein. I loved it.
