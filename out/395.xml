 <sinopse>
  A spoof of Robin Hood in general, and 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' in particular.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The standard story of Robin Hood: Evil Prince John is oppressing the people while good King Richard is away on the Crusades. Robin steals from the tax collectors, wins an archery contest, defeats the Sheriff, and rescues Maid Marian. In this version, however, Mel Brooks adds his own personal touch, parodying traditional adventure films, romance films, and the whole idea of men running around the woods in tights.

    Spoof Director Mel Brooks made a lot of very funny spoof films like Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, SpaceBalls, and Dracula: Dead And Loving It. Robin Hood: Men In Tights is one of my all time favourite spoof films, while I can't really say that it's a masterpiece. It's an Oscar Nominee, when compared to rubbish spoof films like Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet The Spartans by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. The film itself is basically a retelling of the classic tale of Robin Of Loxley, and it's done in the same style as Monty Python And The Holy Grail. Overall; I really enjoyed Robin Hood: Men In Tights, and if you enjoyed Mel Brook's other spoof films, you will be sure to enjoy this! 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I loved the movie and just wanted to share my opinion. Merely giving the movie 10 stars doesn't do it justice. There isn't enough stars in the sky to rate it properly. Brooks is a comical genius and has turned this movie into something very special. I recommend it anyone that loves comedy and/or Mel Brooks. It is easily his best movie, the best comedy and therefore- the best movie ever made. It's a marvel of human ingenuity. It takes a famous and familiar tale and makes it more epic, clever and funny than ever before. It conveys a typical story of good vs evil, but does it in style and class. So what are you waiting for? Go and watch it already!

    While not Mel Brook's funniest movie it is a very good one. Cary Elwes plays a returning crusader who discovers his family castle has been repossessed by a loan shark, played by Avery Schrieber. Richard Lewis plays Prince John and does it extremely well. The Sheriff of Nottingham is played by Roger Rees. He does his usual good job as a foil for most everyone. Dave Chappelle plays a black man in England???? This is the hottest I have ever seen Amy Yasbeck, she plays Maid Marian and she looks very nice in her chastity belt. Patrick Stewart, aka Captain Pecarde, appears at the end as King Richard. He restores things to the norm, gets to kiss the bride and exclaims in a great line "It is good to be the king". Mark Blankenfield plays the faithful but blind, servant Blinkin. Unfortunately he is not that funny. Tracy Ullman plays the witch and while she is not pretty in real life she is super ugly here with the make up, at least I hope it was.

    I hold "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" in higher regards than the Costner and Crowe versions, and note that it's closer to the traditional story than either. Yes, it's satirical because of the mere fact that this one is funny, has intentional anachronisms, and has allusions to 1990s pop culture. I did cringe at a few parts: the rap scene, the Nat-X, and a handful of bad jokes, but here's the catch - they are *supposed* to be bad. Mel Brooks wanted me to squirm at the silly puns. That is not detraction, the movie did *exactly* what it was made to do. If comedy is serious business, then this movie is as serious as the IRS, all the while being as silly as... well, as silly as Mel Brooks. It is, however, no less Robin Hood than Costner's (the Costner version left out the beloved archery contest!) and maybe the best all- around Robin Hood movie since Errol Flynn both in spite of and because of Mel Brooks's unapologetic humour from whom none are safe!

    Robin Hood: Men in Tights stars Cary Elwes, who is definitely one of my favourite actors thanks to this movie and The Princess Bride. This movie is completely silly, but its awesomeness knows hardly any bounds. It never fails to give me a giggle, whether I'm actually watching it or not. I can just think of it and start snickering to myself. This film is a fixture in my DVD collection! And one very good reason for loving it is just how fun it is to sing along with the main theme song - "We're men (manly men!), we're men in tiiii-iiights!" Plus, who could forget the sheer brilliance of a witch called Latrine who requires testicles of a newt to brew up an evil spell? There's just so much goodness to talk when it comes to this movie, about and so little time in each day!

    Nearly twenty years ago, this movie was one that my brother & I deemed worthy enough to pick up on home video (VHS, at the time). Neither of us knew anything about "The Producers", "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", so to us Mel Brooks was just a name. Now, knowing better, I decided to rewatch the movie to see if it really had any merit. In case you couldn't tell from the title, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is a spoof of movies based on the Robin Hood mythology, chiefly the classic "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and the then-recent hit "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves". That's not a bad starting point but the script is a hit and miss affair. Some of the jokes are pretty corny and some then-timely references haven't aged particularly well. It's not all bad, though. The cast is pretty good overall, considering the general mediocrity of the script. Cary Elwes makes out alright in the lead role, though his similar role in "The Princess Bride" is much more satisfying. Tracey Ullman is easily the best of the supporting players in her role as a witch with the hots for the sheriff. Others have their moments, though, including Dave Chappelle (in his first film role), Patrick Stewart (in a memorable cameo) & Dom DeLuise (contributing a credible Godfather impression). Visually, the film is nice and colourful with above average direction from Mel Brooks. The special effects are unimpressive but at least they only see minimal use. Musically, the film's not too bad, either. The theme song ("Men in Tights") is the best of lot but good use is also made of "The Night is Young and You're So Beautiful". As for "Marian" & the "Sherwood Forest Rap", they're decent in a stereotypical sort of way. Ultimately, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is watchable but it's a far cry from Brooks' best. It's a decent diversion for a couple of hours, though I would recommend familiarizing yourself with "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" beforehand. In fact, I'd suggest watching "The Adventures of Robin Hood" regardless of whether or not you're interested in this movie.

    what can u say about Mel Brooks that hasn't been said before,, well this movie in my opinion tops them all, i don't know why it does,, it just does. his cameo is awesome first of all, i guess for me it's all of the references and one liners.. which of course are commonplace for Mel brooks films,, i just love the pun,, when the guy goes to jump and achoo says,, ah man white man can't jump,, this movie just seems to have so many laughs , i've watched this for like the 5 th time now , and it seems to age like a fine whine.. all of the performances are excellent in my book,, Amy yasbeck,, well all i can say is WOW. dick van Patton , Patrick Stewart, Mel's cameo, all of the quirky character's like achoo, asneeze, little john,, the sheriff of course,, robin hood, with an English accent, uma Thurman, as latrine. i could go on and on forever, with how many laughs this film brings me

    Despite being almost universally despised by critics everywhere, I think that this is one of the most beloved comedies of all time. Mel Brooks is a genius, but all comedy fans know that already. His humor shines brighter than ever in Men In Tights. Fans of his work will recognize a few "inside jokes" that are dropped occasionally and dropped with such comedic skill that even those unfamiliar with his other works will laugh out loud at the jokes. The actors pull it off effortlessly, this is a great team of well-timed performers and I can't believe they haven't made another film together, they're excellent. Junk food for the brain, but great for the spirit, don't pass up a chance to check this one out!

    This show, directed by a person that did a lot of comedy, Mel Brooks did it again in this funny show. All the acting is pretty funny, from a sword fight, to a love sequence. This movie is made to be funny, which it succeeds, but I feel as if it has too much romance. There is a whole lot of parts that I feel was unnecessary, and disturbing, for example, the part when Robin sings to Marian announcing his love, his sword comes up looking like a ....., and when Mervin, the Sheriff of Nottingham tries to force Marian to have ... with him, and I assume you can if you try, fill in the gaps. I feel those parts should have been left out. Also, there are parts that were a little on the boring side, like the talk Mervin has with this guy, I forgot his name, but I found that, as well as my friends, a little boring. Other than that, this is a truly hilarious movie that everyone should see at some point.

    Mel Brooks may have produced, directed, and starred in some of the funniest movies since the 1960s, but for his final effort, this movie is really sad. Brooks had fallen into the parity genre by this time and while his earlier effort, Spaceballs, had many memorable moments, this is nothing but a series of worn out and rehashed jokes. The same jokes worked in Blazing Saddles and its successors, but by this time they had lost there way. I hope that people don't think that this is the best of Brooks, take time to see Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or the Producers. Skip this one.

    I hold "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" in higher regards than the Costner and Crowe versions, and note that it's closer to the traditional story than either. Yes, it's satirical because of the mere fact that this one is funny, has intentional anachronisms, and has allusions to 1990s pop culture. I did cringe at a few parts: the rap scene, the Nat-X, and a handful of bad jokes, but here's the catch - they are *supposed* to be bad. Mel Brooks wanted me to squirm at the silly puns. That is not detraction, the movie did *exactly* what it was made to do. If comedy is serious business, then this movie is as serious as the IRS, all the while being as silly as... well, as silly as Mel Brooks. It is, however, no less Robin Hood than Costner's (the Costner version left out the beloved archery contest!) and maybe the best all- around Robin Hood movie since Errol Flynn both in spite of and because of Mel Brooks's unapologetic humour from whom none are safe!

    Robin Hood: Men in Tights stars Cary Elwes, who is definitely one of my favourite actors thanks to this movie and The Princess Bride. This movie is completely silly, but its awesomeness knows hardly any bounds. It never fails to give me a giggle, whether I'm actually watching it or not. I can just think of it and start snickering to myself. This film is a fixture in my DVD collection! And one very good reason for loving it is just how fun it is to sing along with the main theme song - "We're men (manly men!), we're men in tiiii-iiights!" Plus, who could forget the sheer brilliance of a witch called Latrine who requires testicles of a newt to brew up an evil spell? There's just so much goodness to talk when it comes to this movie, about and so little time in each day!

    Nearly twenty years ago, this movie was one that my brother & I deemed worthy enough to pick up on home video (VHS, at the time). Neither of us knew anything about "The Producers", "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", so to us Mel Brooks was just a name. Now, knowing better, I decided to rewatch the movie to see if it really had any merit. In case you couldn't tell from the title, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is a spoof of movies based on the Robin Hood mythology, chiefly the classic "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and the then-recent hit "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves". That's not a bad starting point but the script is a hit and miss affair. Some of the jokes are pretty corny and some then-timely references haven't aged particularly well. It's not all bad, though. The cast is pretty good overall, considering the general mediocrity of the script. Cary Elwes makes out alright in the lead role, though his similar role in "The Princess Bride" is much more satisfying. Tracey Ullman is easily the best of the supporting players in her role as a witch with the hots for the sheriff. Others have their moments, though, including Dave Chappelle (in his first film role), Patrick Stewart (in a memorable cameo) & Dom DeLuise (contributing a credible Godfather impression). Visually, the film is nice and colourful with above average direction from Mel Brooks. The special effects are unimpressive but at least they only see minimal use. Musically, the film's not too bad, either. The theme song ("Men in Tights") is the best of lot but good use is also made of "The Night is Young and You're So Beautiful". As for "Marian" & the "Sherwood Forest Rap", they're decent in a stereotypical sort of way. Ultimately, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is watchable but it's a far cry from Brooks' best. It's a decent diversion for a couple of hours, though I would recommend familiarizing yourself with "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" beforehand. In fact, I'd suggest watching "The Adventures of Robin Hood" regardless of whether or not you're interested in this movie.

    Despite being almost universally despised by critics everywhere, I think that this is one of the most beloved comedies of all time. Mel Brooks is a genius, but all comedy fans know that already. His humor shines brighter than ever in Men In Tights. Fans of his work will recognize a few "inside jokes" that are dropped occasionally and dropped with such comedic skill that even those unfamiliar with his other works will laugh out loud at the jokes. The actors pull it off effortlessly, this is a great team of well-timed performers and I can't believe they haven't made another film together, they're excellent. Junk food for the brain, but great for the spirit, don't pass up a chance to check this one out!

    This show, directed by a person that did a lot of comedy, Mel Brooks did it again in this funny show. All the acting is pretty funny, from a sword fight, to a love sequence. This movie is made to be funny, which it succeeds, but I feel as if it has too much romance. There is a whole lot of parts that I feel was unnecessary, and disturbing, for example, the part when Robin sings to Marian announcing his love, his sword comes up looking like a ....., and when Mervin, the Sheriff of Nottingham tries to force Marian to have ... with him, and I assume you can if you try, fill in the gaps. I feel those parts should have been left out. Also, there are parts that were a little on the boring side, like the talk Mervin has with this guy, I forgot his name, but I found that, as well as my friends, a little boring. Other than that, this is a truly hilarious movie that everyone should see at some point.

    Mel Brooks may have produced, directed, and starred in some of the funniest movies since the 1960s, but for his final effort, this movie is really sad. Brooks had fallen into the parity genre by this time and while his earlier effort, Spaceballs, had many memorable moments, this is nothing but a series of worn out and rehashed jokes. The same jokes worked in Blazing Saddles and its successors, but by this time they had lost there way. I hope that people don't think that this is the best of Brooks, take time to see Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or the Producers. Skip this one.

    Spoof Director Mel Brooks made a lot of very funny spoof films like Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, SpaceBalls, and Dracula: Dead And Loving It. Robin Hood: Men In Tights is one of my all time favourite spoof films, while I can't really say that it's a masterpiece. It's an Oscar Nominee, when compared to rubbish spoof films like Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet The Spartans by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. The film itself is basically a retelling of the classic tale of Robin Of Loxley, and it's done in the same style as Monty Python And The Holy Grail. Overall; I really enjoyed Robin Hood: Men In Tights, and if you enjoyed Mel Brook's other spoof films, you will be sure to enjoy this! 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I loved the movie and just wanted to share my opinion. Merely giving the movie 10 stars doesn't do it justice. There isn't enough stars in the sky to rate it properly. Brooks is a comical genius and has turned this movie into something very special. I recommend it anyone that loves comedy and/or Mel Brooks. It is easily his best movie, the best comedy and therefore- the best movie ever made. It's a marvel of human ingenuity. It takes a famous and familiar tale and makes it more epic, clever and funny than ever before. It conveys a typical story of good vs evil, but does it in style and class. So what are you waiting for? Go and watch it already!

    While not Mel Brook's funniest movie it is a very good one. Cary Elwes plays a returning crusader who discovers his family castle has been repossessed by a loan shark, played by Avery Schrieber. Richard Lewis plays Prince John and does it extremely well. The Sheriff of Nottingham is played by Roger Rees. He does his usual good job as a foil for most everyone. Dave Chappelle plays a black man in England???? This is the hottest I have ever seen Amy Yasbeck, she plays Maid Marian and she looks very nice in her chastity belt. Patrick Stewart, aka Captain Pecarde, appears at the end as King Richard. He restores things to the norm, gets to kiss the bride and exclaims in a great line "It is good to be the king". Mark Blankenfield plays the faithful but blind, servant Blinkin. Unfortunately he is not that funny. Tracy Ullman plays the witch and while she is not pretty in real life she is super ugly here with the make up, at least I hope it was.

    Despite being almost universally despised by critics everywhere, I think that this is one of the most beloved comedies of all time. Mel Brooks is a genius, but all comedy fans know that already. His humor shines brighter than ever in Men In Tights. Fans of his work will recognize a few "inside jokes" that are dropped occasionally and dropped with such comedic skill that even those unfamiliar with his other works will laugh out loud at the jokes. The actors pull it off effortlessly, this is a great team of well-timed performers and I can't believe they haven't made another film together, they're excellent. Junk food for the brain, but great for the spirit, don't pass up a chance to check this one out!

    This show, directed by a person that did a lot of comedy, Mel Brooks did it again in this funny show. All the acting is pretty funny, from a sword fight, to a love sequence. This movie is made to be funny, which it succeeds, but I feel as if it has too much romance. There is a whole lot of parts that I feel was unnecessary, and disturbing, for example, the part when Robin sings to Marian announcing his love, his sword comes up looking like a ....., and when Mervin, the Sheriff of Nottingham tries to force Marian to have ... with him, and I assume you can if you try, fill in the gaps. I feel those parts should have been left out. Also, there are parts that were a little on the boring side, like the talk Mervin has with this guy, I forgot his name, but I found that, as well as my friends, a little boring. Other than that, this is a truly hilarious movie that everyone should see at some point.

    Mel Brooks may have produced, directed, and starred in some of the funniest movies since the 1960s, but for his final effort, this movie is really sad. Brooks had fallen into the parity genre by this time and while his earlier effort, Spaceballs, had many memorable moments, this is nothing but a series of worn out and rehashed jokes. The same jokes worked in Blazing Saddles and its successors, but by this time they had lost there way. I hope that people don't think that this is the best of Brooks, take time to see Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or the Producers. Skip this one.

    Spoof Director Mel Brooks made a lot of very funny spoof films like Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, SpaceBalls, and Dracula: Dead And Loving It. Robin Hood: Men In Tights is one of my all time favourite spoof films, while I can't really say that it's a masterpiece. It's an Oscar Nominee, when compared to rubbish spoof films like Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet The Spartans by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. The film itself is basically a retelling of the classic tale of Robin Of Loxley, and it's done in the same style as Monty Python And The Holy Grail. Overall; I really enjoyed Robin Hood: Men In Tights, and if you enjoyed Mel Brook's other spoof films, you will be sure to enjoy this! 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I loved the movie and just wanted to share my opinion. Merely giving the movie 10 stars doesn't do it justice. There isn't enough stars in the sky to rate it properly. Brooks is a comical genius and has turned this movie into something very special. I recommend it anyone that loves comedy and/or Mel Brooks. It is easily his best movie, the best comedy and therefore- the best movie ever made. It's a marvel of human ingenuity. It takes a famous and familiar tale and makes it more epic, clever and funny than ever before. It conveys a typical story of good vs evil, but does it in style and class. So what are you waiting for? Go and watch it already!

    While not Mel Brook's funniest movie it is a very good one. Cary Elwes plays a returning crusader who discovers his family castle has been repossessed by a loan shark, played by Avery Schrieber. Richard Lewis plays Prince John and does it extremely well. The Sheriff of Nottingham is played by Roger Rees. He does his usual good job as a foil for most everyone. Dave Chappelle plays a black man in England???? This is the hottest I have ever seen Amy Yasbeck, she plays Maid Marian and she looks very nice in her chastity belt. Patrick Stewart, aka Captain Pecarde, appears at the end as King Richard. He restores things to the norm, gets to kiss the bride and exclaims in a great line "It is good to be the king". Mark Blankenfield plays the faithful but blind, servant Blinkin. Unfortunately he is not that funny. Tracy Ullman plays the witch and while she is not pretty in real life she is super ugly here with the make up, at least I hope it was.

    I hold "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" in higher regards than the Costner and Crowe versions, and note that it's closer to the traditional story than either. Yes, it's satirical because of the mere fact that this one is funny, has intentional anachronisms, and has allusions to 1990s pop culture. I did cringe at a few parts: the rap scene, the Nat-X, and a handful of bad jokes, but here's the catch - they are *supposed* to be bad. Mel Brooks wanted me to squirm at the silly puns. That is not detraction, the movie did *exactly* what it was made to do. If comedy is serious business, then this movie is as serious as the IRS, all the while being as silly as... well, as silly as Mel Brooks. It is, however, no less Robin Hood than Costner's (the Costner version left out the beloved archery contest!) and maybe the best all- around Robin Hood movie since Errol Flynn both in spite of and because of Mel Brooks's unapologetic humour from whom none are safe!

    Robin Hood: Men in Tights stars Cary Elwes, who is definitely one of my favourite actors thanks to this movie and The Princess Bride. This movie is completely silly, but its awesomeness knows hardly any bounds. It never fails to give me a giggle, whether I'm actually watching it or not. I can just think of it and start snickering to myself. This film is a fixture in my DVD collection! And one very good reason for loving it is just how fun it is to sing along with the main theme song - "We're men (manly men!), we're men in tiiii-iiights!" Plus, who could forget the sheer brilliance of a witch called Latrine who requires testicles of a newt to brew up an evil spell? There's just so much goodness to talk when it comes to this movie, about and so little time in each day!

    Nearly twenty years ago, this movie was one that my brother & I deemed worthy enough to pick up on home video (VHS, at the time). Neither of us knew anything about "The Producers", "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", so to us Mel Brooks was just a name. Now, knowing better, I decided to rewatch the movie to see if it really had any merit. In case you couldn't tell from the title, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is a spoof of movies based on the Robin Hood mythology, chiefly the classic "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and the then-recent hit "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves". That's not a bad starting point but the script is a hit and miss affair. Some of the jokes are pretty corny and some then-timely references haven't aged particularly well. It's not all bad, though. The cast is pretty good overall, considering the general mediocrity of the script. Cary Elwes makes out alright in the lead role, though his similar role in "The Princess Bride" is much more satisfying. Tracey Ullman is easily the best of the supporting players in her role as a witch with the hots for the sheriff. Others have their moments, though, including Dave Chappelle (in his first film role), Patrick Stewart (in a memorable cameo) & Dom DeLuise (contributing a credible Godfather impression). Visually, the film is nice and colourful with above average direction from Mel Brooks. The special effects are unimpressive but at least they only see minimal use. Musically, the film's not too bad, either. The theme song ("Men in Tights") is the best of lot but good use is also made of "The Night is Young and You're So Beautiful". As for "Marian" & the "Sherwood Forest Rap", they're decent in a stereotypical sort of way. Ultimately, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is watchable but it's a far cry from Brooks' best. It's a decent diversion for a couple of hours, though I would recommend familiarizing yourself with "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" beforehand. In fact, I'd suggest watching "The Adventures of Robin Hood" regardless of whether or not you're interested in this movie.

Brooks is a comical genius and has turned this movie into something very special. I recommend it anyone that loves comedy and/or Mel Brooks. It is easily his best movie, the best comedy and therefore- the best movie ever made. It's a marvel of human ingenuity. It takes a famous and familiar tale and makes it more epic, clever and funny than ever before. It conveys a typical story of good vs evil, but does it in style and class. So what are you waiting for? Go and watch it already!

    While not Mel Brook's funniest movie it is a very good one. Cary Elwes plays a returning crusader who discovers his family castle has been repossessed by a loan shark, played by Avery Schrieber. Richard Lewis plays Prince John and does it extremely well. The Sheriff of Nottingham is played by Roger Rees. He does his usual good job as a foil for most everyone. Dave Chappelle plays a black man in England???? This is the hottest I have ever seen Amy Yasbeck, she plays Maid Marian and she looks very nice in her chastity belt. Patrick Stewart, aka Captain Pecarde, appears at the end as King Richard. He restores things to the norm, gets to kiss the bride and exclaims in a great line "It is good to be the king". Mark Blankenfield plays the faithful but blind, servant Blinkin. Unfortunately he is not that funny. Tracy Ullman plays the witch and while she is not pretty in real life she is super ugly here with the make up, at least I hope it was.

    I hold "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" in higher regards than the Costner and Crowe versions, and note that it's closer to the traditional story than either. Yes, it's satirical because of the mere fact that this one is funny, has intentional anachronisms, and has allusions to 1990s pop culture. I did cringe at a few parts: the rap scene, the Nat-X, and a handful of bad jokes, but here's the catch - they are *supposed* to be bad. Mel Brooks wanted me to squirm at the silly puns. That is not detraction, the movie did *exactly* what it was made to do. If comedy is serious business, then this movie is as serious as the IRS, all the while being as silly as... well, as silly as Mel Brooks. It is, however, no less Robin Hood than Costner's (the Costner version left out the beloved archery contest!) and maybe the best all- around Robin Hood movie since Errol Flynn both in spite of and because of Mel Brooks's unapologetic humour from whom none are safe!

    Robin Hood: Men in Tights stars Cary Elwes, who is definitely one of my favourite actors thanks to this movie and The Princess Bride. This movie is completely silly, but its awesomeness knows hardly any bounds. It never fails to give me a giggle, whether I'm actually watching it or not. I can just think of it and start snickering to myself. This film is a fixture in my DVD collection! And one very good reason for loving it is just how fun it is to sing along with the main theme song - "We're men (manly men!), we're men in tiiii-iiights!" Plus, who could forget the sheer brilliance of a witch called Latrine who requires testicles of a newt to brew up an evil spell? There's just so much goodness to talk when it comes to this movie, about and so little time in each day!

    Nearly twenty years ago, this movie was one that my brother & I deemed worthy enough to pick up on home video (VHS, at the time). Neither of us knew anything about "The Producers", "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", so to us Mel Brooks was just a name. Now, knowing better, I decided to rewatch the movie to see if it really had any merit. In case you couldn't tell from the title, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is a spoof of movies based on the Robin Hood mythology, chiefly the classic "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and the then-recent hit "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves". That's not a bad starting point but the script is a hit and miss affair. Some of the jokes are pretty corny and some then-timely references haven't aged particularly well. It's not all bad, though. The cast is pretty good overall, considering the general mediocrity of the script. Cary Elwes makes out alright in the lead role, though his similar role in "The Princess Bride" is much more satisfying. Tracey Ullman is easily the best of the supporting players in her role as a witch with the hots for the sheriff. Others have their moments, though, including Dave Chappelle (in his first film role), Patrick Stewart (in a memorable cameo) & Dom DeLuise (contributing a credible Godfather impression). Visually, the film is nice and colourful with above average direction from Mel Brooks. The special effects are unimpressive but at least they only see minimal use. Musically, the film's not too bad, either. The theme song ("Men in Tights") is the best of lot but good use is also made of "The Night is Young and You're So Beautiful". As for "Marian" & the "Sherwood Forest Rap", they're decent in a stereotypical sort of way. Ultimately, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is watchable but it's a far cry from Brooks' best. It's a decent diversion for a couple of hours, though I would recommend familiarizing yourself with "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" beforehand. In fact, I'd suggest watching "The Adventures of Robin Hood" regardless of whether or not you're interested in this movie.

    what can u say about Mel Brooks that hasn't been said before,, well this movie in my opinion tops them all, i don't know why it does,, it just does. his cameo is awesome first of all, i guess for me it's all of the references and one liners.. which of course are commonplace for Mel brooks films,, i just love the pun,, when the guy goes to jump and achoo says,, ah man white man can't jump,, this movie just seems to have so many laughs , i've watched this for like the 5 th time now , and it seems to age like a fine whine.. all of the performances are excellent in my book,, Amy yasbeck,, well all i can say is WOW. dick van Patton , Patrick Stewart, Mel's cameo, all of the quirky character's like achoo, asneeze, little john,, the sheriff of course,, robin hood, with an English accent, uma Thurman, as latrine. i could go on and on forever, with how many laughs this film brings me

    Despite being almost universally despised by critics everywhere, I think that this is one of the most beloved comedies of all time. Mel Brooks is a genius, but all comedy fans know that already. His humor shines brighter than ever in Men In Tights. Fans of his work will recognize a few "inside jokes" that are dropped occasionally and dropped with such comedic skill that even those unfamiliar with his other works will laugh out loud at the jokes. The actors pull it off effortlessly, this is a great team of well-timed performers and I can't believe they haven't made another film together, they're excellent. Junk food for the brain, but great for the spirit, don't pass up a chance to check this one out!

    This show, directed by a person that did a lot of comedy, Mel Brooks did it again in this funny show. All the acting is pretty funny, from a sword fight, to a love sequence. This movie is made to be funny, which it succeeds, but I feel as if it has too much romance. There is a whole lot of parts that I feel was unnecessary, and disturbing, for example, the part when Robin sings to Marian announcing his love, his sword comes up looking like a ....., and when Mervin, the Sheriff of Nottingham tries to force Marian to have ... with him, and I assume you can if you try, fill in the gaps. I feel those parts should have been left out. Also, there are parts that were a little on the boring side, like the talk Mervin has with this guy, I forgot his name, but I found that, as well as my friends, a little boring. Other than that, this is a truly hilarious movie that everyone should see at some point.

    Mel Brooks may have produced, directed, and starred in some of the funniest movies since the 1960s, but for his final effort, this movie is really sad. Brooks had fallen into the parity genre by this time and while his earlier effort, Spaceballs, had many memorable moments, this is nothing but a series of worn out and rehashed jokes. The same jokes worked in Blazing Saddles and its successors, but by this time they had lost there way. I hope that people don't think that this is the best of Brooks, take time to see Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or the Producers. Skip this one.

    Spoof Director Mel Brooks made a lot of very funny spoof films like Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, SpaceBalls, and Dracula: Dead And Loving It. Robin Hood: Men In Tights is one of my all time favourite spoof films, while I can't really say that it's a masterpiece. It's an Oscar Nominee, when compared to rubbish spoof films like Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet The Spartans by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. The film itself is basically a retelling of the classic tale of Robin Of Loxley, and it's done in the same style as Monty Python And The Holy Grail. Overall; I really enjoyed Robin Hood: Men In Tights, and if you enjoyed Mel Brook's other spoof films, you will be sure to enjoy this! 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

Others have their moments, though, including Dave Chappelle (in his first film role), Patrick Stewart (in a memorable cameo) & Dom DeLuise (contributing a credible Godfather impression). Visually, the film is nice and colourful with above average direction from Mel Brooks. The special effects are unimpressive but at least they only see minimal use. Musically, the film's not too bad, either. The theme song ("Men in Tights") is the best of lot but good use is also made of "The Night is Young and You're So Beautiful". As for "Marian" & the "Sherwood Forest Rap", they're decent in a stereotypical sort of way. Ultimately, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is watchable but it's a far cry from Brooks' best. It's a decent diversion for a couple of hours, though I would recommend familiarizing yourself with "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" beforehand. In fact, I'd suggest watching "The Adventures of Robin Hood" regardless of whether or not you're interested in this movie.

    what can u say about Mel Brooks that hasn't been said before,, well this movie in my opinion tops them all, i don't know why it does,, it just does. his cameo is awesome first of all, i guess for me it's all of the references and one liners.. which of course are commonplace for Mel brooks films,, i just love the pun,, when the guy goes to jump and achoo says,, ah man white man can't jump,, this movie just seems to have so many laughs , i've watched this for like the 5 th time now , and it seems to age like a fine whine.. all of the performances are excellent in my book,, Amy yasbeck,, well all i can say is WOW. dick van Patton , Patrick Stewart, Mel's cameo, all of the quirky character's like achoo, asneeze, little john,, the sheriff of course,, robin hood, with an English accent, uma Thurman, as latrine. i could go on and on forever, with how many laughs this film brings me

    Despite being almost universally despised by critics everywhere, I think that this is one of the most beloved comedies of all time. Mel Brooks is a genius, but all comedy fans know that already. His humor shines brighter than ever in Men In Tights. Fans of his work will recognize a few "inside jokes" that are dropped occasionally and dropped with such comedic skill that even those unfamiliar with his other works will laugh out loud at the jokes. The actors pull it off effortlessly, this is a great team of well-timed performers and I can't believe they haven't made another film together, they're excellent. Junk food for the brain, but great for the spirit, don't pass up a chance to check this one out!

    This show, directed by a person that did a lot of comedy, Mel Brooks did it again in this funny show. All the acting is pretty funny, from a sword fight, to a love sequence. This movie is made to be funny, which it succeeds, but I feel as if it has too much romance. There is a whole lot of parts that I feel was unnecessary, and disturbing, for example, the part when Robin sings to Marian announcing his love, his sword comes up looking like a ....., and when Mervin, the Sheriff of Nottingham tries to force Marian to have ... with him, and I assume you can if you try, fill in the gaps. I feel those parts should have been left out. Also, there are parts that were a little on the boring side, like the talk Mervin has with this guy, I forgot his name, but I found that, as well as my friends, a little boring. Other than that, this is a truly hilarious movie that everyone should see at some point.

    Mel Brooks may have produced, directed, and starred in some of the funniest movies since the 1960s, but for his final effort, this movie is really sad. Brooks had fallen into the parity genre by this time and while his earlier effort, Spaceballs, had many memorable moments, this is nothing but a series of worn out and rehashed jokes. The same jokes worked in Blazing Saddles and its successors, but by this time they had lost there way. I hope that people don't think that this is the best of Brooks, take time to see Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or the Producers. Skip this one.
