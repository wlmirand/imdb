    Against popular opinion I don't think this is a awful movie. I hope that we will see a remake of this movie someday. Hollywood instead of remaking for example "Mad Max" should work with movies that had potential like "Water world". Ironically this one is obviously inspired by "Mad Max" , but at least with some originality to it Â– a whole world full of water. It's an really interesting and original idea. "Water world" starts promising with a dark ton (just like "Mad Max" , but unfortunately quickly becomes a fairytale very in Spielberg's style (pirates , orphan , mystical island) . Unfortunately Kevin Reynolds is no Spielberg and "Water world" lacks magic and charm typical for most of Spielberg's movies. Kevin Costner plays here a silent stranger. He's OK as the dead pan, monosyllabic Good Guy. Dennis Hopper gives a hammy , but fun performance as the leader of pirates. Other actors are good. The movie lacks true drama and deeper message . There is some stupidity here (the indestructible raft , the exploding water scooters) still it works as Sunday afternoon entertainment. I give it 5/10.

    Imaginative, But Just A Routine Action/Adventure That Runs Out Of Steam

    "Waterworld" is a very imaginative story. No doubt about that. It's set at some unspecified point in the future on an earth that none of us would recognize. The basic story is that the polar ice caps have completely melted and there's no dry land left - well, except for a perhaps mythical place called - appropriately enough - Dryland. It's implausible (actually, impossible) right from the start. According to my research, even if the polar ice caps did melt the water levels would rise about 200 feet. That's a lot, but there are a lot of things in our world taller than 200 feet - some natural and some man made - so the earth wouldn't be immersed in water to quite this extent. But, hey, it's fiction. It doesn't have to make sense. It has to entertain. For a while, it does that. At first it's interesting enough just to try to get a sense of this world. What's it about? Who lives on it? What sort of "culture" has developed in these conditions? We find out about those things through the eyes of the Mariner (Kevin Costner) - a lone sailor with a pretty interesting boat that seems to have lots of gadgets. Through him we find out about the Smokers - basically pirates - and we discover the atoll - a floating community in the middle of the ocean (but then again, isn't everything in the middle of the ocean if there's only ocean?) where the Mariner comes to trade. Here, he discovers a little girl named Enola (Tina Majorino) and her sort of adoptive mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who want to escape the atoll and search for Dryland. The Mariner gets in trouble, is discovered to be a mutant (with gills and webbed feet) and is about to be killed, when the Smokers attack. They want Enola, because she has a map tattooed on her back that they believe is a map that will lead them to Dryland. Why she has the map tattooed on her back is a bit of a mystery. The first hour or so as we learned about all this was pretty interesting actually. Costner was good; so was Tripplehorn. But the story settled into little more than a routine action/adventure in the last hour or so. Once we had learned the basics about Waterworld, there was nothing more really interesting about it, and action/adventures are pretty commonplace. You need something more to hold the viewers' interest. Yes, there's the search for Dryland, but that really just serves as an excuse for the Smokers to kidnap Enola, and for the Mariner to set out to rescue her. It has all the standard stuff you'd see in any action movie, there's nothing especially dramatic about the end of the search for Dryland, and the plot is full of holes. The first hour isn't too bad; after that I thought this simply ran out of steam. (5/10)

    When I watched this movie, I went in expecting a campy good time with big sets and fun characters. However, when I did see it, I saw an epic character study of not just a small group of people trying to survive, but the entire human race. Actors: Let's face it, there were only two actors in this that you actually wanted to see: Kevin Costner and Dennis Hopper. Kevin Costner: Damn. And I mean damn. This character is a gritty look at what could happen to someone who has been forced into a life of pure hardship because of his differences. While it didn't make too much sense that he was shunned, it still works well. His uncaring attitude reflects his years of isolation out at sea. Dennis Hopper: His rendition of a crazed leader of terrorist-styled organization known as the smokers is just perfect. He's over the top and incredibly hilarious. He really brings something to the performance that I don't think anybody else could have. Script: It's kind of goofy and kid's movie-esque, but, it really brings to light the side of humanity that is still relatively unexplored. You never know how someone might react to something, so really can't say it's too goofy in the context of the film, though. So, while it isn't the best story, it is definitely a worth while story. Overall: Great film. It has its high and low points, but I, personally, think the high points extremely outweigh the low points. Make of it what you will.

    I saw this movie at the drive-in when it first came out. A totally unexpected thrill-ride. I am grateful that films like this exist. Shows the variation in humanity from love and beauty to ugliness and destruction. If somebody gave this film a bad review, it's because they think they think they're smarter than they actually are and they don't know what makes a good film. Kevin Costner, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Dennis Hopper,and Tina Majorino give great performances. I would recommend this film to anybody that is tired of the new film style of quick cut shots, cgi, and unnecessary close ups. The people that gave this movie bad reviews obviously have unreasonable values and expectations, and lack the ability to appreciate a great film. The same people that go through life unhappy, yet telling everybody else how to live.

    The awesome never stops in Waterworld. Costner plays a Man Fish! ...or Merman! Actually considering that he's more mammal than he is fish, he's probably closer to a seal. But then again every homosap is rendered a marine mammal in a big wet world. Costner sails an awesome transformer trimaran that makes the Milleneum Falcon look like a piece of junk. Can the Millennium Falcon sail through space using a giant kite? No! Early in the film, Costner enters a floating junk heap where shark ribs are the meal of the day and dirt is not exactly dirt cheap. But tension rises like a high tide when Costner refuses to whore himself out to a family looking for a seed donor. The water reaches a boiling point when the atollers examine Kevin's ears. Turns out that flotilla folk don't think highly of fish fellas. When Kev has to escape, he gets caught in a particularly clingy relationship with Helen and an unwilling adoptive father of a tatted toddler who has the cutest tattoo you've ever seen. The odd trio find themselves caught between the Deacon and the deep blue sea. The Deacon is a charismatic redneck pirate played here by Dennis Hopper. Problem for Deac is that if Costner's around, these waters are a no smoking zone, so Deacon's Smokers have their waterwork cut out for them. In the eyes of Deacon Hopper, Costner is a turd that won't flush. That's because Costner is a turd that won't go down without a fight. He's a turd that kicks ass. If you're a fan of cute little girls with tattoos, but not in a creepy way, you should check out Waterworld and yes, that is Jack Black as the pilot of the "skyboat."

    I cant even believe that this movie is rated as one of the worst movies, because it really isn't. The atmosphere, music, props, sets is all wonderful. If this movie was so bad, then why is it, or was one of the highest grossing movies ever on home video? Many years ago, i read it grossed over $500 million on home video since its release. For that reason, it also became one of the early releases on the HD-DVD format. I have never seen the much longer director's cut, but Universal should release it as it most likely would push a few copies looking at how popular this movie was at home. The recent Dredd movie flopped at US cinema's, and it still became #1 seller at Amazon USA. It shows that a lot of people waits for the home video release instead of watching them at cinema.

    Earth is engulfed with water when the polar ice caps melts, leaving the lands and civilisation beneath the sea. Drifters sail across the waters, trading for supplies and salvaging what is left of civilisation, survivors live in squalor and pirates called "Smokers" travel across Waterworld in search of a mythical "Dryland". A mysterious drifter called The Mariner is sentenced to death when the community discover he is a mutant. When they are attacked by Smokers led by Deacon, a woman named Helen and her adopted daughter Enola bribe The Mariner to take them to Dryland, believing The Mariner has been there. But the Mariner, Helen and Enola are pursued by Deacon and the Smokers, when The Mariner learns the tattoo on Enola's back is a map that will lead them to Dryland... It's a shame that the controversy of the film outweighs the actual content, because to be fair, it's still a good adventure movie, and given that 1995 had a really poor summer blockbuster output, this was one of the better ones. Costner is as good as always as the loner who doesn't say much, and you can tell where the budget went when you watch the film, its beautiful. It's a little too long, and some of the incidental characters needn't had been included, but we have a great villain thanks to Hopper, and its hilarious to see how many scenes have Costners head to begin with, and then pulling back to see him doing a stunt as if to say 'look! I'm doing this myself!'. The rest of the cast are fine, and the last twenty minutes are brilliant, putting good use to the Exxon Valdez. Forget all the plot holes (cigarettes are really still around), and the fact that Costner is a scapegoat, you will enjoy this for what it is. Pure Sunday afternoon popcorn fodder.

    Dystopian Pirates vs. Reluctant Hero adventure. 5.9 ? That (re)confirms how completely off the mark IMDb ratings can be. I would say this movie is more like a 7.3. Imaginative, captivating premise (irregardless of whether its actually possible). Decent acting. Good spectrum of characters. Big budget. Lots of fun. Yes it's ridden with editorial flops (especially) if you watch the wide screen version. Ex. The famous scene where the bottle of scotch is gets more full as the scene goes on (clearly some thirsty actors!). But really, for me, it didn't detract much from the film.

    This movie isn't so bad. A lot of critics canned the movie for it's over the top material. While some of the cheesy lines can be a bit over the top, it's a great adventure movie. It felt like Road Warrior on Jet Skis. Water world is a unique post-apocalyptic film in which the entire world has become enveloped in water. However, even after the ice caps have melted and flooded the earth, humans have survived. Society continues on man-made floating apparatuses created using pre-apocalyptic ruins. These dwellings can range in size from boats to entire floating fortified communities. No governments exist as we know them now and society has become primitive and brutal and survival is found in strength and numbers. The main character is an abrupt and highly resourceful introvert played by Kevin Costner call 'The Mariner'. A Clint Eastwood 'Man with no name' type of a character, quiet, gruff, eccentric stranger with a strong, but unorthodox sense of justice. He finds himself in conflict with Deacon (Dennis Hooper) the leader of an evil gang call 'Smokers'. They are call 'Smokers' due to the fact, they smoke cigarettes, and use combustion engines to move around while everyone else uses Eco friendly ships. The reason of this conflict is the search of a map to a utopia place call 'Dry Land' which happens to be on the back of annoying young child Enola (Tina Majorino) whom Mariner is taking care of, with her mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) because they help him from escaping from being 'recycled' (death sentence) for being an mutant (Half fish, half man). It's a tug of war between Deacon and the Mariner on whom will find Dry Land first. Much of the movie's entertainment factor is found in the well-choreographed action scenes being presented on exceptional sets, which have a strong and specific theme. The movie had beautiful wide shots of endless oceans, giving the movie its Lawrence in the Arabia moment of survivors living in a harsh environment. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazing, its main theme sounds like a savage epic that can be confused with Jurassic Park. Check out the song 'swimming' I didn't expect it to be quite beautiful. 'Escaping the Smokers' has this cool exotic futuristic swashbuckling tone. I'm still puzzled as to why so many people slag this movie off, as people might think the Mariner was too much of an ass. Let's remember, he was a drifter with long periods of loneness, and trust issues way before the two women enter his life, and after they enter, he doesn't know how to deal with them. There is a redemptive arc to him, as he teaching Enola to swim, and end up protecting her from the Smokers. It is everything I would expect if the world flooded and the survivors had to survive. People would band together and yes, people will have the close mindedness to change (Hating mutations). The pedophilia which the term only exists because of modern day society, in post apocalypse with small numbers, girls would be traded off the moment to rebuild population numbers. It makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is in a world that has been covered by water for hundreds of years, how come people still have items from the 20th century and early 21th century only? Not late 21th century or 22 century? Another is the 177 minute director's cut, don't watch it. You're better off watching the theatric version as the movie is too long, and wear down its welcome. The reasons why fans hate it, because it was average for a blockbuster for the time. Plus, it was the most expensive movie ever made. Hence a colossal failure relative to expectations, which turned into the running joke. People that hate it, probably haven't watch the film. If you haven't saw it. You just need to approach it with an open mind, and don't listen to all the bad hype.

    Very interesting idea of a whole world under the sea and what humanity would do if that happened. I was intrigued in the beginning and expected something major. The boats and the water villages are absolutely nicely designed. Unfortunately the movie itself just boils down to lots of shooting, explosions and people dying for no reason. The main character indeed was more evil than good. The bad guys are bad and attack a water village - why? for what? Where do they get food? Where do they get oil for their tanker and the boats? Where do they get bullets for their assault rifles so as to shoot them in such amounts? The movie becomes more and more stupid and illogical. Looks like someone came with nice idea at first but didn't know what to do with it.

A mysterious drifter called The Mariner is sentenced to death when the community discover he is a mutant. When they are attacked by Smokers led by Deacon, a woman named Helen and her adopted daughter Enola bribe The Mariner to take them to Dryland, believing The Mariner has been there. But the Mariner, Helen and Enola are pursued by Deacon and the Smokers, when The Mariner learns the tattoo on Enola's back is a map that will lead them to Dryland... It's a shame that the controversy of the film outweighs the actual content, because to be fair, it's still a good adventure movie, and given that 1995 had a really poor summer blockbuster output, this was one of the better ones. Costner is as good as always as the loner who doesn't say much, and you can tell where the budget went when you watch the film, its beautiful. It's a little too long, and some of the incidental characters needn't had been included, but we have a great villain thanks to Hopper, and its hilarious to see how many scenes have Costners head to begin with, and then pulling back to see him doing a stunt as if to say 'look! I'm doing this myself!'. The rest of the cast are fine, and the last twenty minutes are brilliant, putting good use to the Exxon Valdez. Forget all the plot holes (cigarettes are really still around), and the fact that Costner is a scapegoat, you will enjoy this for what it is. Pure Sunday afternoon popcorn fodder.

    Dystopian Pirates vs. Reluctant Hero adventure. 5.9 ? That (re)confirms how completely off the mark IMDb ratings can be. I would say this movie is more like a 7.3. Imaginative, captivating premise (irregardless of whether its actually possible). Decent acting. Good spectrum of characters. Big budget. Lots of fun. Yes it's ridden with editorial flops (especially) if you watch the wide screen version. Ex. The famous scene where the bottle of scotch is gets more full as the scene goes on (clearly some thirsty actors!). But really, for me, it didn't detract much from the film.

    This movie isn't so bad. A lot of critics canned the movie for it's over the top material. While some of the cheesy lines can be a bit over the top, it's a great adventure movie. It felt like Road Warrior on Jet Skis. Water world is a unique post-apocalyptic film in which the entire world has become enveloped in water. However, even after the ice caps have melted and flooded the earth, humans have survived. Society continues on man-made floating apparatuses created using pre-apocalyptic ruins. These dwellings can range in size from boats to entire floating fortified communities. No governments exist as we know them now and society has become primitive and brutal and survival is found in strength and numbers. The main character is an abrupt and highly resourceful introvert played by Kevin Costner call 'The Mariner'. A Clint Eastwood 'Man with no name' type of a character, quiet, gruff, eccentric stranger with a strong, but unorthodox sense of justice. He finds himself in conflict with Deacon (Dennis Hooper) the leader of an evil gang call 'Smokers'. They are call 'Smokers' due to the fact, they smoke cigarettes, and use combustion engines to move around while everyone else uses Eco friendly ships. The reason of this conflict is the search of a map to a utopia place call 'Dry Land' which happens to be on the back of annoying young child Enola (Tina Majorino) whom Mariner is taking care of, with her mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) because they help him from escaping from being 'recycled' (death sentence) for being an mutant (Half fish, half man). It's a tug of war between Deacon and the Mariner on whom will find Dry Land first. Much of the movie's entertainment factor is found in the well-choreographed action scenes being presented on exceptional sets, which have a strong and specific theme. The movie had beautiful wide shots of endless oceans, giving the movie its Lawrence in the Arabia moment of survivors living in a harsh environment. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazing, its main theme sounds like a savage epic that can be confused with Jurassic Park. Check out the song 'swimming' I didn't expect it to be quite beautiful. 'Escaping the Smokers' has this cool exotic futuristic swashbuckling tone. I'm still puzzled as to why so many people slag this movie off, as people might think the Mariner was too much of an ass. Let's remember, he was a drifter with long periods of loneness, and trust issues way before the two women enter his life, and after they enter, he doesn't know how to deal with them. There is a redemptive arc to him, as he teaching Enola to swim, and end up protecting her from the Smokers. It is everything I would expect if the world flooded and the survivors had to survive. People would band together and yes, people will have the close mindedness to change (Hating mutations). The pedophilia which the term only exists because of modern day society, in post apocalypse with small numbers, girls would be traded off the moment to rebuild population numbers. It makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is in a world that has been covered by water for hundreds of years, how come people still have items from the 20th century and early 21th century only? Not late 21th century or 22 century? Another is the 177 minute director's cut, don't watch it. You're better off watching the theatric version as the movie is too long, and wear down its welcome. The reasons why fans hate it, because it was average for a blockbuster for the time. Plus, it was the most expensive movie ever made. Hence a colossal failure relative to expectations, which turned into the running joke. People that hate it, probably haven't watch the film. If you haven't saw it. You just need to approach it with an open mind, and don't listen to all the bad hype.

    Very interesting idea of a whole world under the sea and what humanity would do if that happened. I was intrigued in the beginning and expected something major. The boats and the water villages are absolutely nicely designed. Unfortunately the movie itself just boils down to lots of shooting, explosions and people dying for no reason. The main character indeed was more evil than good. The bad guys are bad and attack a water village - why? for what? Where do they get food? Where do they get oil for their tanker and the boats? Where do they get bullets for their assault rifles so as to shoot them in such amounts? The movie becomes more and more stupid and illogical. Looks like someone came with nice idea at first but didn't know what to do with it.

    Against popular opinion I don't think this is a awful movie. I hope that we will see a remake of this movie someday. Hollywood instead of remaking for example "Mad Max" should work with movies that had potential like "Water world". Ironically this one is obviously inspired by "Mad Max" , but at least with some originality to it Â– a whole world full of water. It's an really interesting and original idea. "Water world" starts promising with a dark ton (just like "Mad Max" , but unfortunately quickly becomes a fairytale very in Spielberg's style (pirates , orphan , mystical island) . Unfortunately Kevin Reynolds is no Spielberg and "Water world" lacks magic and charm typical for most of Spielberg's movies. Kevin Costner plays here a silent stranger. He's OK as the dead pan, monosyllabic Good Guy. Dennis Hopper gives a hammy , but fun performance as the leader of pirates. Other actors are good. The movie lacks true drama and deeper message . There is some stupidity here (the indestructible raft , the exploding water scooters) still it works as Sunday afternoon entertainment. I give it 5/10.

    Imaginative, But Just A Routine Action/Adventure That Runs Out Of Steam

    "Waterworld" is a very imaginative story. No doubt about that. It's set at some unspecified point in the future on an earth that none of us would recognize. The basic story is that the polar ice caps have completely melted and there's no dry land left - well, except for a perhaps mythical place called - appropriately enough - Dryland. It's implausible (actually, impossible) right from the start. According to my research, even if the polar ice caps did melt the water levels would rise about 200 feet. That's a lot, but there are a lot of things in our world taller than 200 feet - some natural and some man made - so the earth wouldn't be immersed in water to quite this extent. But, hey, it's fiction. It doesn't have to make sense. It has to entertain. For a while, it does that. At first it's interesting enough just to try to get a sense of this world. What's it about? Who lives on it? What sort of "culture" has developed in these conditions? We find out about those things through the eyes of the Mariner (Kevin Costner) - a lone sailor with a pretty interesting boat that seems to have lots of gadgets. Through him we find out about the Smokers - basically pirates - and we discover the atoll - a floating community in the middle of the ocean (but then again, isn't everything in the middle of the ocean if there's only ocean?) where the Mariner comes to trade. Here, he discovers a little girl named Enola (Tina Majorino) and her sort of adoptive mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who want to escape the atoll and search for Dryland. The Mariner gets in trouble, is discovered to be a mutant (with gills and webbed feet) and is about to be killed, when the Smokers attack. They want Enola, because she has a map tattooed on her back that they believe is a map that will lead them to Dryland. Why she has the map tattooed on her back is a bit of a mystery. The first hour or so as we learned about all this was pretty interesting actually. Costner was good; so was Tripplehorn. But the story settled into little more than a routine action/adventure in the last hour or so. Once we had learned the basics about Waterworld, there was nothing more really interesting about it, and action/adventures are pretty commonplace. You need something more to hold the viewers' interest. Yes, there's the search for Dryland, but that really just serves as an excuse for the Smokers to kidnap Enola, and for the Mariner to set out to rescue her. It has all the standard stuff you'd see in any action movie, there's nothing especially dramatic about the end of the search for Dryland, and the plot is full of holes. The first hour isn't too bad; after that I thought this simply ran out of steam. (5/10)

    When I watched this movie, I went in expecting a campy good time with big sets and fun characters. However, when I did see it, I saw an epic character study of not just a small group of people trying to survive, but the entire human race. Actors: Let's face it, there were only two actors in this that you actually wanted to see: Kevin Costner and Dennis Hopper. Kevin Costner: Damn. And I mean damn. This character is a gritty look at what could happen to someone who has been forced into a life of pure hardship because of his differences. While it didn't make too much sense that he was shunned, it still works well. His uncaring attitude reflects his years of isolation out at sea. Dennis Hopper: His rendition of a crazed leader of terrorist-styled organization known as the smokers is just perfect. He's over the top and incredibly hilarious. He really brings something to the performance that I don't think anybody else could have. Script: It's kind of goofy and kid's movie-esque, but, it really brings to light the side of humanity that is still relatively unexplored. You never know how someone might react to something, so really can't say it's too goofy in the context of the film, though. So, while it isn't the best story, it is definitely a worth while story. Overall: Great film. It has its high and low points, but I, personally, think the high points extremely outweigh the low points. Make of it what you will.

    I saw this movie at the drive-in when it first came out. A totally unexpected thrill-ride. I am grateful that films like this exist. Shows the variation in humanity from love and beauty to ugliness and destruction. If somebody gave this film a bad review, it's because they think they think they're smarter than they actually are and they don't know what makes a good film. Kevin Costner, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Dennis Hopper,and Tina Majorino give great performances. I would recommend this film to anybody that is tired of the new film style of quick cut shots, cgi, and unnecessary close ups. The people that gave this movie bad reviews obviously have unreasonable values and expectations, and lack the ability to appreciate a great film. The same people that go through life unhappy, yet telling everybody else how to live.

    The awesome never stops in Waterworld. Costner plays a Man Fish! ...or Merman! Actually considering that he's more mammal than he is fish, he's probably closer to a seal. But then again every homosap is rendered a marine mammal in a big wet world. Costner sails an awesome transformer trimaran that makes the Milleneum Falcon look like a piece of junk. Can the Millennium Falcon sail through space using a giant kite? No! Early in the film, Costner enters a floating junk heap where shark ribs are the meal of the day and dirt is not exactly dirt cheap. But tension rises like a high tide when Costner refuses to whore himself out to a family looking for a seed donor. The water reaches a boiling point when the atollers examine Kevin's ears. Turns out that flotilla folk don't think highly of fish fellas. When Kev has to escape, he gets caught in a particularly clingy relationship with Helen and an unwilling adoptive father of a tatted toddler who has the cutest tattoo you've ever seen. The odd trio find themselves caught between the Deacon and the deep blue sea. The Deacon is a charismatic redneck pirate played here by Dennis Hopper. Problem for Deac is that if Costner's around, these waters are a no smoking zone, so Deacon's Smokers have their waterwork cut out for them. In the eyes of Deacon Hopper, Costner is a turd that won't flush. That's because Costner is a turd that won't go down without a fight. He's a turd that kicks ass. If you're a fan of cute little girls with tattoos, but not in a creepy way, you should check out Waterworld and yes, that is Jack Black as the pilot of the "skyboat."

    I cant even believe that this movie is rated as one of the worst movies, because it really isn't. The atmosphere, music, props, sets is all wonderful. If this movie was so bad, then why is it, or was one of the highest grossing movies ever on home video? Many years ago, i read it grossed over $500 million on home video since its release. For that reason, it also became one of the early releases on the HD-DVD format. I have never seen the much longer director's cut, but Universal should release it as it most likely would push a few copies looking at how popular this movie was at home. The recent Dredd movie flopped at US cinema's, and it still became #1 seller at Amazon USA. It shows that a lot of people waits for the home video release instead of watching them at cinema.

Script: It's kind of goofy and kid's movie-esque, but, it really brings to light the side of humanity that is still relatively unexplored. You never know how someone might react to something, so really can't say it's too goofy in the context of the film, though. So, while it isn't the best story, it is definitely a worth while story. Overall: Great film. It has its high and low points, but I, personally, think the high points extremely outweigh the low points. Make of it what you will.

    I saw this movie at the drive-in when it first came out. A totally unexpected thrill-ride. I am grateful that films like this exist. Shows the variation in humanity from love and beauty to ugliness and destruction. If somebody gave this film a bad review, it's because they think they think they're smarter than they actually are and they don't know what makes a good film. Kevin Costner, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Dennis Hopper,and Tina Majorino give great performances. I would recommend this film to anybody that is tired of the new film style of quick cut shots, cgi, and unnecessary close ups. The people that gave this movie bad reviews obviously have unreasonable values and expectations, and lack the ability to appreciate a great film. The same people that go through life unhappy, yet telling everybody else how to live.

    The awesome never stops in Waterworld. Costner plays a Man Fish! ...or Merman! Actually considering that he's more mammal than he is fish, he's probably closer to a seal. But then again every homosap is rendered a marine mammal in a big wet world. Costner sails an awesome transformer trimaran that makes the Milleneum Falcon look like a piece of junk. Can the Millennium Falcon sail through space using a giant kite? No! Early in the film, Costner enters a floating junk heap where shark ribs are the meal of the day and dirt is not exactly dirt cheap. But tension rises like a high tide when Costner refuses to whore himself out to a family looking for a seed donor. The water reaches a boiling point when the atollers examine Kevin's ears. Turns out that flotilla folk don't think highly of fish fellas. When Kev has to escape, he gets caught in a particularly clingy relationship with Helen and an unwilling adoptive father of a tatted toddler who has the cutest tattoo you've ever seen. The odd trio find themselves caught between the Deacon and the deep blue sea. The Deacon is a charismatic redneck pirate played here by Dennis Hopper. Problem for Deac is that if Costner's around, these waters are a no smoking zone, so Deacon's Smokers have their waterwork cut out for them. In the eyes of Deacon Hopper, Costner is a turd that won't flush. That's because Costner is a turd that won't go down without a fight. He's a turd that kicks ass. If you're a fan of cute little girls with tattoos, but not in a creepy way, you should check out Waterworld and yes, that is Jack Black as the pilot of the "skyboat."

    I cant even believe that this movie is rated as one of the worst movies, because it really isn't. The atmosphere, music, props, sets is all wonderful. If this movie was so bad, then why is it, or was one of the highest grossing movies ever on home video? Many years ago, i read it grossed over $500 million on home video since its release. For that reason, it also became one of the early releases on the HD-DVD format. I have never seen the much longer director's cut, but Universal should release it as it most likely would push a few copies looking at how popular this movie was at home. The recent Dredd movie flopped at US cinema's, and it still became #1 seller at Amazon USA. It shows that a lot of people waits for the home video release instead of watching them at cinema.

    Earth is engulfed with water when the polar ice caps melts, leaving the lands and civilisation beneath the sea. Drifters sail across the waters, trading for supplies and salvaging what is left of civilisation, survivors live in squalor and pirates called "Smokers" travel across Waterworld in search of a mythical "Dryland". A mysterious drifter called The Mariner is sentenced to death when the community discover he is a mutant. When they are attacked by Smokers led by Deacon, a woman named Helen and her adopted daughter Enola bribe The Mariner to take them to Dryland, believing The Mariner has been there. But the Mariner, Helen and Enola are pursued by Deacon and the Smokers, when The Mariner learns the tattoo on Enola's back is a map that will lead them to Dryland... It's a shame that the controversy of the film outweighs the actual content, because to be fair, it's still a good adventure movie, and given that 1995 had a really poor summer blockbuster output, this was one of the better ones. Costner is as good as always as the loner who doesn't say much, and you can tell where the budget went when you watch the film, its beautiful. It's a little too long, and some of the incidental characters needn't had been included, but we have a great villain thanks to Hopper, and its hilarious to see how many scenes have Costners head to begin with, and then pulling back to see him doing a stunt as if to say 'look! I'm doing this myself!'. The rest of the cast are fine, and the last twenty minutes are brilliant, putting good use to the Exxon Valdez. Forget all the plot holes (cigarettes are really still around), and the fact that Costner is a scapegoat, you will enjoy this for what it is. Pure Sunday afternoon popcorn fodder.

    Dystopian Pirates vs. Reluctant Hero adventure. 5.9 ? That (re)confirms how completely off the mark IMDb ratings can be. I would say this movie is more like a 7.3. Imaginative, captivating premise (irregardless of whether its actually possible). Decent acting. Good spectrum of characters. Big budget. Lots of fun. Yes it's ridden with editorial flops (especially) if you watch the wide screen version. Ex. The famous scene where the bottle of scotch is gets more full as the scene goes on (clearly some thirsty actors!). But really, for me, it didn't detract much from the film.

    This movie isn't so bad. A lot of critics canned the movie for it's over the top material. While some of the cheesy lines can be a bit over the top, it's a great adventure movie. It felt like Road Warrior on Jet Skis. Water world is a unique post-apocalyptic film in which the entire world has become enveloped in water. However, even after the ice caps have melted and flooded the earth, humans have survived. Society continues on man-made floating apparatuses created using pre-apocalyptic ruins. These dwellings can range in size from boats to entire floating fortified communities. No governments exist as we know them now and society has become primitive and brutal and survival is found in strength and numbers. The main character is an abrupt and highly resourceful introvert played by Kevin Costner call 'The Mariner'. A Clint Eastwood 'Man with no name' type of a character, quiet, gruff, eccentric stranger with a strong, but unorthodox sense of justice. He finds himself in conflict with Deacon (Dennis Hooper) the leader of an evil gang call 'Smokers'. They are call 'Smokers' due to the fact, they smoke cigarettes, and use combustion engines to move around while everyone else uses Eco friendly ships. The reason of this conflict is the search of a map to a utopia place call 'Dry Land' which happens to be on the back of annoying young child Enola (Tina Majorino) whom Mariner is taking care of, with her mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) because they help him from escaping from being 'recycled' (death sentence) for being an mutant (Half fish, half man). It's a tug of war between Deacon and the Mariner on whom will find Dry Land first. Much of the movie's entertainment factor is found in the well-choreographed action scenes being presented on exceptional sets, which have a strong and specific theme. The movie had beautiful wide shots of endless oceans, giving the movie its Lawrence in the Arabia moment of survivors living in a harsh environment. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazing, its main theme sounds like a savage epic that can be confused with Jurassic Park. Check out the song 'swimming' I didn't expect it to be quite beautiful. 'Escaping the Smokers' has this cool exotic futuristic swashbuckling tone. I'm still puzzled as to why so many people slag this movie off, as people might think the Mariner was too much of an ass. Let's remember, he was a drifter with long periods of loneness, and trust issues way before the two women enter his life, and after they enter, he doesn't know how to deal with them. There is a redemptive arc to him, as he teaching Enola to swim, and end up protecting her from the Smokers. It is everything I would expect if the world flooded and the survivors had to survive. People would band together and yes, people will have the close mindedness to change (Hating mutations). The pedophilia which the term only exists because of modern day society, in post apocalypse with small numbers, girls would be traded off the moment to rebuild population numbers. It makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is in a world that has been covered by water for hundreds of years, how come people still have items from the 20th century and early 21th century only? Not late 21th century or 22 century? Another is the 177 minute director's cut, don't watch it. You're better off watching the theatric version as the movie is too long, and wear down its welcome. The reasons why fans hate it, because it was average for a blockbuster for the time. Plus, it was the most expensive movie ever made. Hence a colossal failure relative to expectations, which turned into the running joke. People that hate it, probably haven't watch the film. If you haven't saw it. You just need to approach it with an open mind, and don't listen to all the bad hype.

    Very interesting idea of a whole world under the sea and what humanity would do if that happened. I was intrigued in the beginning and expected something major. The boats and the water villages are absolutely nicely designed. Unfortunately the movie itself just boils down to lots of shooting, explosions and people dying for no reason. The main character indeed was more evil than good. The bad guys are bad and attack a water village - why? for what? Where do they get food? Where do they get oil for their tanker and the boats? Where do they get bullets for their assault rifles so as to shoot them in such amounts? The movie becomes more and more stupid and illogical. Looks like someone came with nice idea at first but didn't know what to do with it.

    Against popular opinion I don't think this is a awful movie. I hope that we will see a remake of this movie someday. Hollywood instead of remaking for example "Mad Max" should work with movies that had potential like "Water world". Ironically this one is obviously inspired by "Mad Max" , but at least with some originality to it Â– a whole world full of water. It's an really interesting and original idea. "Water world" starts promising with a dark ton (just like "Mad Max" , but unfortunately quickly becomes a fairytale very in Spielberg's style (pirates , orphan , mystical island) . Unfortunately Kevin Reynolds is no Spielberg and "Water world" lacks magic and charm typical for most of Spielberg's movies. Kevin Costner plays here a silent stranger. He's OK as the dead pan, monosyllabic Good Guy. Dennis Hopper gives a hammy , but fun performance as the leader of pirates. Other actors are good. The movie lacks true drama and deeper message . There is some stupidity here (the indestructible raft , the exploding water scooters) still it works as Sunday afternoon entertainment. I give it 5/10.

    Imaginative, But Just A Routine Action/Adventure That Runs Out Of Steam

    "Waterworld" is a very imaginative story. No doubt about that. It's set at some unspecified point in the future on an earth that none of us would recognize. The basic story is that the polar ice caps have completely melted and there's no dry land left - well, except for a perhaps mythical place called - appropriately enough - Dryland. It's implausible (actually, impossible) right from the start. According to my research, even if the polar ice caps did melt the water levels would rise about 200 feet. That's a lot, but there are a lot of things in our world taller than 200 feet - some natural and some man made - so the earth wouldn't be immersed in water to quite this extent. But, hey, it's fiction. It doesn't have to make sense. It has to entertain. For a while, it does that. At first it's interesting enough just to try to get a sense of this world. What's it about? Who lives on it? What sort of "culture" has developed in these conditions? We find out about those things through the eyes of the Mariner (Kevin Costner) - a lone sailor with a pretty interesting boat that seems to have lots of gadgets. Through him we find out about the Smokers - basically pirates - and we discover the atoll - a floating community in the middle of the ocean (but then again, isn't everything in the middle of the ocean if there's only ocean?) where the Mariner comes to trade. Here, he discovers a little girl named Enola (Tina Majorino) and her sort of adoptive mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who want to escape the atoll and search for Dryland. The Mariner gets in trouble, is discovered to be a mutant (with gills and webbed feet) and is about to be killed, when the Smokers attack. They want Enola, because she has a map tattooed on her back that they believe is a map that will lead them to Dryland. Why she has the map tattooed on her back is a bit of a mystery. The first hour or so as we learned about all this was pretty interesting actually. Costner was good; so was Tripplehorn. But the story settled into little more than a routine action/adventure in the last hour or so. Once we had learned the basics about Waterworld, there was nothing more really interesting about it, and action/adventures are pretty commonplace. You need something more to hold the viewers' interest. Yes, there's the search for Dryland, but that really just serves as an excuse for the Smokers to kidnap Enola, and for the Mariner to set out to rescue her. It has all the standard stuff you'd see in any action movie, there's nothing especially dramatic about the end of the search for Dryland, and the plot is full of holes. The first hour isn't too bad; after that I thought this simply ran out of steam. (5/10)

    When I watched this movie, I went in expecting a campy good time with big sets and fun characters. However, when I did see it, I saw an epic character study of not just a small group of people trying to survive, but the entire human race. Actors: Let's face it, there were only two actors in this that you actually wanted to see: Kevin Costner and Dennis Hopper. Kevin Costner: Damn. And I mean damn. This character is a gritty look at what could happen to someone who has been forced into a life of pure hardship because of his differences. While it didn't make too much sense that he was shunned, it still works well. His uncaring attitude reflects his years of isolation out at sea. Dennis Hopper: His rendition of a crazed leader of terrorist-styled organization known as the smokers is just perfect. He's over the top and incredibly hilarious. He really brings something to the performance that I don't think anybody else could have. Script: It's kind of goofy and kid's movie-esque, but, it really brings to light the side of humanity that is still relatively unexplored. You never know how someone might react to something, so really can't say it's too goofy in the context of the film, though. So, while it isn't the best story, it is definitely a worth while story. Overall: Great film. It has its high and low points, but I, personally, think the high points extremely outweigh the low points. Make of it what you will.

Hollywood instead of remaking for example "Mad Max" should work with movies that had potential like "Water world". Ironically this one is obviously inspired by "Mad Max" , but at least with some originality to it Â– a whole world full of water. It's an really interesting and original idea. "Water world" starts promising with a dark ton (just like "Mad Max" , but unfortunately quickly becomes a fairytale very in Spielberg's style (pirates , orphan , mystical island) . Unfortunately Kevin Reynolds is no Spielberg and "Water world" lacks magic and charm typical for most of Spielberg's movies. Kevin Costner plays here a silent stranger. He's OK as the dead pan, monosyllabic Good Guy. Dennis Hopper gives a hammy , but fun performance as the leader of pirates. Other actors are good. The movie lacks true drama and deeper message . There is some stupidity here (the indestructible raft , the exploding water scooters) still it works as Sunday afternoon entertainment. I give it 5/10.

    Imaginative, But Just A Routine Action/Adventure That Runs Out Of Steam

    "Waterworld" is a very imaginative story. No doubt about that. It's set at some unspecified point in the future on an earth that none of us would recognize. The basic story is that the polar ice caps have completely melted and there's no dry land left - well, except for a perhaps mythical place called - appropriately enough - Dryland. It's implausible (actually, impossible) right from the start. According to my research, even if the polar ice caps did melt the water levels would rise about 200 feet. That's a lot, but there are a lot of things in our world taller than 200 feet - some natural and some man made - so the earth wouldn't be immersed in water to quite this extent. But, hey, it's fiction. It doesn't have to make sense. It has to entertain. For a while, it does that. At first it's interesting enough just to try to get a sense of this world. What's it about? Who lives on it? What sort of "culture" has developed in these conditions? We find out about those things through the eyes of the Mariner (Kevin Costner) - a lone sailor with a pretty interesting boat that seems to have lots of gadgets. Through him we find out about the Smokers - basically pirates - and we discover the atoll - a floating community in the middle of the ocean (but then again, isn't everything in the middle of the ocean if there's only ocean?) where the Mariner comes to trade. Here, he discovers a little girl named Enola (Tina Majorino) and her sort of adoptive mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who want to escape the atoll and search for Dryland. The Mariner gets in trouble, is discovered to be a mutant (with gills and webbed feet) and is about to be killed, when the Smokers attack. They want Enola, because she has a map tattooed on her back that they believe is a map that will lead them to Dryland. Why she has the map tattooed on her back is a bit of a mystery. The first hour or so as we learned about all this was pretty interesting actually. Costner was good; so was Tripplehorn. But the story settled into little more than a routine action/adventure in the last hour or so. Once we had learned the basics about Waterworld, there was nothing more really interesting about it, and action/adventures are pretty commonplace. You need something more to hold the viewers' interest. Yes, there's the search for Dryland, but that really just serves as an excuse for the Smokers to kidnap Enola, and for the Mariner to set out to rescue her. It has all the standard stuff you'd see in any action movie, there's nothing especially dramatic about the end of the search for Dryland, and the plot is full of holes. The first hour isn't too bad; after that I thought this simply ran out of steam. (5/10)

    When I watched this movie, I went in expecting a campy good time with big sets and fun characters. However, when I did see it, I saw an epic character study of not just a small group of people trying to survive, but the entire human race. Actors: Let's face it, there were only two actors in this that you actually wanted to see: Kevin Costner and Dennis Hopper. Kevin Costner: Damn. And I mean damn. This character is a gritty look at what could happen to someone who has been forced into a life of pure hardship because of his differences. While it didn't make too much sense that he was shunned, it still works well. His uncaring attitude reflects his years of isolation out at sea. Dennis Hopper: His rendition of a crazed leader of terrorist-styled organization known as the smokers is just perfect. He's over the top and incredibly hilarious. He really brings something to the performance that I don't think anybody else could have. Script: It's kind of goofy and kid's movie-esque, but, it really brings to light the side of humanity that is still relatively unexplored. You never know how someone might react to something, so really can't say it's too goofy in the context of the film, though. So, while it isn't the best story, it is definitely a worth while story. Overall: Great film. It has its high and low points, but I, personally, think the high points extremely outweigh the low points. Make of it what you will.

    I saw this movie at the drive-in when it first came out. A totally unexpected thrill-ride. I am grateful that films like this exist. Shows the variation in humanity from love and beauty to ugliness and destruction. If somebody gave this film a bad review, it's because they think they think they're smarter than they actually are and they don't know what makes a good film. Kevin Costner, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Dennis Hopper,and Tina Majorino give great performances. I would recommend this film to anybody that is tired of the new film style of quick cut shots, cgi, and unnecessary close ups. The people that gave this movie bad reviews obviously have unreasonable values and expectations, and lack the ability to appreciate a great film. The same people that go through life unhappy, yet telling everybody else how to live.

    The awesome never stops in Waterworld. Costner plays a Man Fish! ...or Merman! Actually considering that he's more mammal than he is fish, he's probably closer to a seal. But then again every homosap is rendered a marine mammal in a big wet world. Costner sails an awesome transformer trimaran that makes the Milleneum Falcon look like a piece of junk. Can the Millennium Falcon sail through space using a giant kite? No! Early in the film, Costner enters a floating junk heap where shark ribs are the meal of the day and dirt is not exactly dirt cheap. But tension rises like a high tide when Costner refuses to whore himself out to a family looking for a seed donor. The water reaches a boiling point when the atollers examine Kevin's ears. Turns out that flotilla folk don't think highly of fish fellas. When Kev has to escape, he gets caught in a particularly clingy relationship with Helen and an unwilling adoptive father of a tatted toddler who has the cutest tattoo you've ever seen. The odd trio find themselves caught between the Deacon and the deep blue sea. The Deacon is a charismatic redneck pirate played here by Dennis Hopper. Problem for Deac is that if Costner's around, these waters are a no smoking zone, so Deacon's Smokers have their waterwork cut out for them. In the eyes of Deacon Hopper, Costner is a turd that won't flush. That's because Costner is a turd that won't go down without a fight. He's a turd that kicks ass. If you're a fan of cute little girls with tattoos, but not in a creepy way, you should check out Waterworld and yes, that is Jack Black as the pilot of the "skyboat."

    I cant even believe that this movie is rated as one of the worst movies, because it really isn't. The atmosphere, music, props, sets is all wonderful. If this movie was so bad, then why is it, or was one of the highest grossing movies ever on home video? Many years ago, i read it grossed over $500 million on home video since its release. For that reason, it also became one of the early releases on the HD-DVD format. I have never seen the much longer director's cut, but Universal should release it as it most likely would push a few copies looking at how popular this movie was at home. The recent Dredd movie flopped at US cinema's, and it still became #1 seller at Amazon USA. It shows that a lot of people waits for the home video release instead of watching them at cinema.

    Earth is engulfed with water when the polar ice caps melts, leaving the lands and civilisation beneath the sea. Drifters sail across the waters, trading for supplies and salvaging what is left of civilisation, survivors live in squalor and pirates called "Smokers" travel across Waterworld in search of a mythical "Dryland". A mysterious drifter called The Mariner is sentenced to death when the community discover he is a mutant. When they are attacked by Smokers led by Deacon, a woman named Helen and her adopted daughter Enola bribe The Mariner to take them to Dryland, believing The Mariner has been there. But the Mariner, Helen and Enola are pursued by Deacon and the Smokers, when The Mariner learns the tattoo on Enola's back is a map that will lead them to Dryland... It's a shame that the controversy of the film outweighs the actual content, because to be fair, it's still a good adventure movie, and given that 1995 had a really poor summer blockbuster output, this was one of the better ones. Costner is as good as always as the loner who doesn't say much, and you can tell where the budget went when you watch the film, its beautiful. It's a little too long, and some of the incidental characters needn't had been included, but we have a great villain thanks to Hopper, and its hilarious to see how many scenes have Costners head to begin with, and then pulling back to see him doing a stunt as if to say 'look! I'm doing this myself!'. The rest of the cast are fine, and the last twenty minutes are brilliant, putting good use to the Exxon Valdez. Forget all the plot holes (cigarettes are really still around), and the fact that Costner is a scapegoat, you will enjoy this for what it is. Pure Sunday afternoon popcorn fodder.

    Dystopian Pirates vs. Reluctant Hero adventure. 5.9 ? That (re)confirms how completely off the mark IMDb ratings can be. I would say this movie is more like a 7.3. Imaginative, captivating premise (irregardless of whether its actually possible). Decent acting. Good spectrum of characters. Big budget. Lots of fun. Yes it's ridden with editorial flops (especially) if you watch the wide screen version. Ex. The famous scene where the bottle of scotch is gets more full as the scene goes on (clearly some thirsty actors!). But really, for me, it didn't detract much from the film.

    This movie isn't so bad. A lot of critics canned the movie for it's over the top material. While some of the cheesy lines can be a bit over the top, it's a great adventure movie. It felt like Road Warrior on Jet Skis. Water world is a unique post-apocalyptic film in which the entire world has become enveloped in water. However, even after the ice caps have melted and flooded the earth, humans have survived. Society continues on man-made floating apparatuses created using pre-apocalyptic ruins. These dwellings can range in size from boats to entire floating fortified communities. No governments exist as we know them now and society has become primitive and brutal and survival is found in strength and numbers. The main character is an abrupt and highly resourceful introvert played by Kevin Costner call 'The Mariner'. A Clint Eastwood 'Man with no name' type of a character, quiet, gruff, eccentric stranger with a strong, but unorthodox sense of justice. He finds himself in conflict with Deacon (Dennis Hooper) the leader of an evil gang call 'Smokers'. They are call 'Smokers' due to the fact, they smoke cigarettes, and use combustion engines to move around while everyone else uses Eco friendly ships. The reason of this conflict is the search of a map to a utopia place call 'Dry Land' which happens to be on the back of annoying young child Enola (Tina Majorino) whom Mariner is taking care of, with her mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) because they help him from escaping from being 'recycled' (death sentence) for being an mutant (Half fish, half man). It's a tug of war between Deacon and the Mariner on whom will find Dry Land first. Much of the movie's entertainment factor is found in the well-choreographed action scenes being presented on exceptional sets, which have a strong and specific theme. The movie had beautiful wide shots of endless oceans, giving the movie its Lawrence in the Arabia moment of survivors living in a harsh environment. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazing, its main theme sounds like a savage epic that can be confused with Jurassic Park. Check out the song 'swimming' I didn't expect it to be quite beautiful. 'Escaping the Smokers' has this cool exotic futuristic swashbuckling tone. I'm still puzzled as to why so many people slag this movie off, as people might think the Mariner was too much of an ass. Let's remember, he was a drifter with long periods of loneness, and trust issues way before the two women enter his life, and after they enter, he doesn't know how to deal with them. There is a redemptive arc to him, as he teaching Enola to swim, and end up protecting her from the Smokers. It is everything I would expect if the world flooded and the survivors had to survive. People would band together and yes, people will have the close mindedness to change (Hating mutations). The pedophilia which the term only exists because of modern day society, in post apocalypse with small numbers, girls would be traded off the moment to rebuild population numbers. It makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is in a world that has been covered by water for hundreds of years, how come people still have items from the 20th century and early 21th century only? Not late 21th century or 22 century? Another is the 177 minute director's cut, don't watch it. You're better off watching the theatric version as the movie is too long, and wear down its welcome. The reasons why fans hate it, because it was average for a blockbuster for the time. Plus, it was the most expensive movie ever made. Hence a colossal failure relative to expectations, which turned into the running joke. People that hate it, probably haven't watch the film. If you haven't saw it. You just need to approach it with an open mind, and don't listen to all the bad hype.

    Very interesting idea of a whole world under the sea and what humanity would do if that happened. I was intrigued in the beginning and expected something major. The boats and the water villages are absolutely nicely designed. Unfortunately the movie itself just boils down to lots of shooting, explosions and people dying for no reason. The main character indeed was more evil than good. The bad guys are bad and attack a water village - why? for what? Where do they get food? Where do they get oil for their tanker and the boats? Where do they get bullets for their assault rifles so as to shoot them in such amounts? The movie becomes more and more stupid and illogical. Looks like someone came with nice idea at first but didn't know what to do with it.

    This movie isn't so bad. A lot of critics canned the movie for it's over the top material. While some of the cheesy lines can be a bit over the top, it's a great adventure movie. It felt like Road Warrior on Jet Skis. Water world is a unique post-apocalyptic film in which the entire world has become enveloped in water. However, even after the ice caps have melted and flooded the earth, humans have survived. Society continues on man-made floating apparatuses created using pre-apocalyptic ruins. These dwellings can range in size from boats to entire floating fortified communities. No governments exist as we know them now and society has become primitive and brutal and survival is found in strength and numbers. The main character is an abrupt and highly resourceful introvert played by Kevin Costner call 'The Mariner'. A Clint Eastwood 'Man with no name' type of a character, quiet, gruff, eccentric stranger with a strong, but unorthodox sense of justice. He finds himself in conflict with Deacon (Dennis Hooper) the leader of an evil gang call 'Smokers'. They are call 'Smokers' due to the fact, they smoke cigarettes, and use combustion engines to move around while everyone else uses Eco friendly ships. The reason of this conflict is the search of a map to a utopia place call 'Dry Land' which happens to be on the back of annoying young child Enola (Tina Majorino) whom Mariner is taking care of, with her mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) because they help him from escaping from being 'recycled' (death sentence) for being an mutant (Half fish, half man). It's a tug of war between Deacon and the Mariner on whom will find Dry Land first. Much of the movie's entertainment factor is found in the well-choreographed action scenes being presented on exceptional sets, which have a strong and specific theme. The movie had beautiful wide shots of endless oceans, giving the movie its Lawrence in the Arabia moment of survivors living in a harsh environment. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazing, its main theme sounds like a savage epic that can be confused with Jurassic Park. Check out the song 'swimming' I didn't expect it to be quite beautiful. 'Escaping the Smokers' has this cool exotic futuristic swashbuckling tone. I'm still puzzled as to why so many people slag this movie off, as people might think the Mariner was too much of an ass. Let's remember, he was a drifter with long periods of loneness, and trust issues way before the two women enter his life, and after they enter, he doesn't know how to deal with them. There is a redemptive arc to him, as he teaching Enola to swim, and end up protecting her from the Smokers. It is everything I would expect if the world flooded and the survivors had to survive. People would band together and yes, people will have the close mindedness to change (Hating mutations). The pedophilia which the term only exists because of modern day society, in post apocalypse with small numbers, girls would be traded off the moment to rebuild population numbers. It makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is in a world that has been covered by water for hundreds of years, how come people still have items from the 20th century and early 21th century only? Not late 21th century or 22 century? Another is the 177 minute director's cut, don't watch it. You're better off watching the theatric version as the movie is too long, and wear down its welcome. The reasons why fans hate it, because it was average for a blockbuster for the time. Plus, it was the most expensive movie ever made. Hence a colossal failure relative to expectations, which turned into the running joke. People that hate it, probably haven't watch the film. If you haven't saw it. You just need to approach it with an open mind, and don't listen to all the bad hype.

    Very interesting idea of a whole world under the sea and what humanity would do if that happened. I was intrigued in the beginning and expected something major. The boats and the water villages are absolutely nicely designed. Unfortunately the movie itself just boils down to lots of shooting, explosions and people dying for no reason. The main character indeed was more evil than good. The bad guys are bad and attack a water village - why? for what? Where do they get food? Where do they get oil for their tanker and the boats? Where do they get bullets for their assault rifles so as to shoot them in such amounts? The movie becomes more and more stupid and illogical. Looks like someone came with nice idea at first but didn't know what to do with it.

    Against popular opinion I don't think this is a awful movie. I hope that we will see a remake of this movie someday. Hollywood instead of remaking for example "Mad Max" should work with movies that had potential like "Water world". Ironically this one is obviously inspired by "Mad Max" , but at least with some originality to it Â– a whole world full of water. It's an really interesting and original idea. "Water world" starts promising with a dark ton (just like "Mad Max" , but unfortunately quickly becomes a fairytale very in Spielberg's style (pirates , orphan , mystical island) . Unfortunately Kevin Reynolds is no Spielberg and "Water world" lacks magic and charm typical for most of Spielberg's movies. Kevin Costner plays here a silent stranger. He's OK as the dead pan, monosyllabic Good Guy. Dennis Hopper gives a hammy , but fun performance as the leader of pirates. Other actors are good. The movie lacks true drama and deeper message . There is some stupidity here (the indestructible raft , the exploding water scooters) still it works as Sunday afternoon entertainment. I give it 5/10.

    Imaginative, But Just A Routine Action/Adventure That Runs Out Of Steam

    "Waterworld" is a very imaginative story. No doubt about that. It's set at some unspecified point in the future on an earth that none of us would recognize. The basic story is that the polar ice caps have completely melted and there's no dry land left - well, except for a perhaps mythical place called - appropriately enough - Dryland. It's implausible (actually, impossible) right from the start. According to my research, even if the polar ice caps did melt the water levels would rise about 200 feet. That's a lot, but there are a lot of things in our world taller than 200 feet - some natural and some man made - so the earth wouldn't be immersed in water to quite this extent. But, hey, it's fiction. It doesn't have to make sense. It has to entertain. For a while, it does that. At first it's interesting enough just to try to get a sense of this world. What's it about? Who lives on it? What sort of "culture" has developed in these conditions? We find out about those things through the eyes of the Mariner (Kevin Costner) - a lone sailor with a pretty interesting boat that seems to have lots of gadgets. Through him we find out about the Smokers - basically pirates - and we discover the atoll - a floating community in the middle of the ocean (but then again, isn't everything in the middle of the ocean if there's only ocean?) where the Mariner comes to trade. Here, he discovers a little girl named Enola (Tina Majorino) and her sort of adoptive mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who want to escape the atoll and search for Dryland. The Mariner gets in trouble, is discovered to be a mutant (with gills and webbed feet) and is about to be killed, when the Smokers attack. They want Enola, because she has a map tattooed on her back that they believe is a map that will lead them to Dryland. Why she has the map tattooed on her back is a bit of a mystery. The first hour or so as we learned about all this was pretty interesting actually. Costner was good; so was Tripplehorn. But the story settled into little more than a routine action/adventure in the last hour or so. Once we had learned the basics about Waterworld, there was nothing more really interesting about it, and action/adventures are pretty commonplace. You need something more to hold the viewers' interest. Yes, there's the search for Dryland, but that really just serves as an excuse for the Smokers to kidnap Enola, and for the Mariner to set out to rescue her. It has all the standard stuff you'd see in any action movie, there's nothing especially dramatic about the end of the search for Dryland, and the plot is full of holes. The first hour isn't too bad; after that I thought this simply ran out of steam. (5/10)

    When I watched this movie, I went in expecting a campy good time with big sets and fun characters. However, when I did see it, I saw an epic character study of not just a small group of people trying to survive, but the entire human race. Actors: Let's face it, there were only two actors in this that you actually wanted to see: Kevin Costner and Dennis Hopper. Kevin Costner: Damn. And I mean damn. This character is a gritty look at what could happen to someone who has been forced into a life of pure hardship because of his differences. While it didn't make too much sense that he was shunned, it still works well. His uncaring attitude reflects his years of isolation out at sea. Dennis Hopper: His rendition of a crazed leader of terrorist-styled organization known as the smokers is just perfect. He's over the top and incredibly hilarious. He really brings something to the performance that I don't think anybody else could have. Script: It's kind of goofy and kid's movie-esque, but, it really brings to light the side of humanity that is still relatively unexplored. You never know how someone might react to something, so really can't say it's too goofy in the context of the film, though. So, while it isn't the best story, it is definitely a worth while story. Overall: Great film. It has its high and low points, but I, personally, think the high points extremely outweigh the low points. Make of it what you will.

    I saw this movie at the drive-in when it first came out. A totally unexpected thrill-ride. I am grateful that films like this exist. Shows the variation in humanity from love and beauty to ugliness and destruction. If somebody gave this film a bad review, it's because they think they think they're smarter than they actually are and they don't know what makes a good film. Kevin Costner, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Dennis Hopper,and Tina Majorino give great performances. I would recommend this film to anybody that is tired of the new film style of quick cut shots, cgi, and unnecessary close ups. The people that gave this movie bad reviews obviously have unreasonable values and expectations, and lack the ability to appreciate a great film. The same people that go through life unhappy, yet telling everybody else how to live.

    The awesome never stops in Waterworld. Costner plays a Man Fish! ...or Merman! Actually considering that he's more mammal than he is fish, he's probably closer to a seal. But then again every homosap is rendered a marine mammal in a big wet world. Costner sails an awesome transformer trimaran that makes the Milleneum Falcon look like a piece of junk. Can the Millennium Falcon sail through space using a giant kite? No! Early in the film, Costner enters a floating junk heap where shark ribs are the meal of the day and dirt is not exactly dirt cheap. But tension rises like a high tide when Costner refuses to whore himself out to a family looking for a seed donor. The water reaches a boiling point when the atollers examine Kevin's ears. Turns out that flotilla folk don't think highly of fish fellas. When Kev has to escape, he gets caught in a particularly clingy relationship with Helen and an unwilling adoptive father of a tatted toddler who has the cutest tattoo you've ever seen. The odd trio find themselves caught between the Deacon and the deep blue sea. The Deacon is a charismatic redneck pirate played here by Dennis Hopper. Problem for Deac is that if Costner's around, these waters are a no smoking zone, so Deacon's Smokers have their waterwork cut out for them. In the eyes of Deacon Hopper, Costner is a turd that won't flush. That's because Costner is a turd that won't go down without a fight. He's a turd that kicks ass. If you're a fan of cute little girls with tattoos, but not in a creepy way, you should check out Waterworld and yes, that is Jack Black as the pilot of the "skyboat."

    I cant even believe that this movie is rated as one of the worst movies, because it really isn't. The atmosphere, music, props, sets is all wonderful. If this movie was so bad, then why is it, or was one of the highest grossing movies ever on home video? Many years ago, i read it grossed over $500 million on home video since its release. For that reason, it also became one of the early releases on the HD-DVD format. I have never seen the much longer director's cut, but Universal should release it as it most likely would push a few copies looking at how popular this movie was at home. The recent Dredd movie flopped at US cinema's, and it still became #1 seller at Amazon USA. It shows that a lot of people waits for the home video release instead of watching them at cinema.

    Earth is engulfed with water when the polar ice caps melts, leaving the lands and civilisation beneath the sea. Drifters sail across the waters, trading for supplies and salvaging what is left of civilisation, survivors live in squalor and pirates called "Smokers" travel across Waterworld in search of a mythical "Dryland". A mysterious drifter called The Mariner is sentenced to death when the community discover he is a mutant. When they are attacked by Smokers led by Deacon, a woman named Helen and her adopted daughter Enola bribe The Mariner to take them to Dryland, believing The Mariner has been there. But the Mariner, Helen and Enola are pursued by Deacon and the Smokers, when The Mariner learns the tattoo on Enola's back is a map that will lead them to Dryland... It's a shame that the controversy of the film outweighs the actual content, because to be fair, it's still a good adventure movie, and given that 1995 had a really poor summer blockbuster output, this was one of the better ones. Costner is as good as always as the loner who doesn't say much, and you can tell where the budget went when you watch the film, its beautiful. It's a little too long, and some of the incidental characters needn't had been included, but we have a great villain thanks to Hopper, and its hilarious to see how many scenes have Costners head to begin with, and then pulling back to see him doing a stunt as if to say 'look! I'm doing this myself!'. The rest of the cast are fine, and the last twenty minutes are brilliant, putting good use to the Exxon Valdez. Forget all the plot holes (cigarettes are really still around), and the fact that Costner is a scapegoat, you will enjoy this for what it is. Pure Sunday afternoon popcorn fodder.

    Dystopian Pirates vs. Reluctant Hero adventure. 5.9 ? That (re)confirms how completely off the mark IMDb ratings can be. I would say this movie is more like a 7.3. Imaginative, captivating premise (irregardless of whether its actually possible). Decent acting. Good spectrum of characters. Big budget. Lots of fun. Yes it's ridden with editorial flops (especially) if you watch the wide screen version. Ex. The famous scene where the bottle of scotch is gets more full as the scene goes on (clearly some thirsty actors!). But really, for me, it didn't detract much from the film.

The odd trio find themselves caught between the Deacon and the deep blue sea. The Deacon is a charismatic redneck pirate played here by Dennis Hopper. Problem for Deac is that if Costner's around, these waters are a no smoking zone, so Deacon's Smokers have their waterwork cut out for them. In the eyes of Deacon Hopper, Costner is a turd that won't flush. That's because Costner is a turd that won't go down without a fight. He's a turd that kicks ass. If you're a fan of cute little girls with tattoos, but not in a creepy way, you should check out Waterworld and yes, that is Jack Black as the pilot of the "skyboat."

    I cant even believe that this movie is rated as one of the worst movies, because it really isn't. The atmosphere, music, props, sets is all wonderful. If this movie was so bad, then why is it, or was one of the highest grossing movies ever on home video? Many years ago, i read it grossed over $500 million on home video since its release. For that reason, it also became one of the early releases on the HD-DVD format. I have never seen the much longer director's cut, but Universal should release it as it most likely would push a few copies looking at how popular this movie was at home. The recent Dredd movie flopped at US cinema's, and it still became #1 seller at Amazon USA. It shows that a lot of people waits for the home video release instead of watching them at cinema.

    Earth is engulfed with water when the polar ice caps melts, leaving the lands and civilisation beneath the sea. Drifters sail across the waters, trading for supplies and salvaging what is left of civilisation, survivors live in squalor and pirates called "Smokers" travel across Waterworld in search of a mythical "Dryland". A mysterious drifter called The Mariner is sentenced to death when the community discover he is a mutant. When they are attacked by Smokers led by Deacon, a woman named Helen and her adopted daughter Enola bribe The Mariner to take them to Dryland, believing The Mariner has been there. But the Mariner, Helen and Enola are pursued by Deacon and the Smokers, when The Mariner learns the tattoo on Enola's back is a map that will lead them to Dryland... It's a shame that the controversy of the film outweighs the actual content, because to be fair, it's still a good adventure movie, and given that 1995 had a really poor summer blockbuster output, this was one of the better ones. Costner is as good as always as the loner who doesn't say much, and you can tell where the budget went when you watch the film, its beautiful. It's a little too long, and some of the incidental characters needn't had been included, but we have a great villain thanks to Hopper, and its hilarious to see how many scenes have Costners head to begin with, and then pulling back to see him doing a stunt as if to say 'look! I'm doing this myself!'. The rest of the cast are fine, and the last twenty minutes are brilliant, putting good use to the Exxon Valdez. Forget all the plot holes (cigarettes are really still around), and the fact that Costner is a scapegoat, you will enjoy this for what it is. Pure Sunday afternoon popcorn fodder.

    Dystopian Pirates vs. Reluctant Hero adventure. 5.9 ? That (re)confirms how completely off the mark IMDb ratings can be. I would say this movie is more like a 7.3. Imaginative, captivating premise (irregardless of whether its actually possible). Decent acting. Good spectrum of characters. Big budget. Lots of fun. Yes it's ridden with editorial flops (especially) if you watch the wide screen version. Ex. The famous scene where the bottle of scotch is gets more full as the scene goes on (clearly some thirsty actors!). But really, for me, it didn't detract much from the film.

    This movie isn't so bad. A lot of critics canned the movie for it's over the top material. While some of the cheesy lines can be a bit over the top, it's a great adventure movie. It felt like Road Warrior on Jet Skis. Water world is a unique post-apocalyptic film in which the entire world has become enveloped in water. However, even after the ice caps have melted and flooded the earth, humans have survived. Society continues on man-made floating apparatuses created using pre-apocalyptic ruins. These dwellings can range in size from boats to entire floating fortified communities. No governments exist as we know them now and society has become primitive and brutal and survival is found in strength and numbers. The main character is an abrupt and highly resourceful introvert played by Kevin Costner call 'The Mariner'. A Clint Eastwood 'Man with no name' type of a character, quiet, gruff, eccentric stranger with a strong, but unorthodox sense of justice. He finds himself in conflict with Deacon (Dennis Hooper) the leader of an evil gang call 'Smokers'. They are call 'Smokers' due to the fact, they smoke cigarettes, and use combustion engines to move around while everyone else uses Eco friendly ships. The reason of this conflict is the search of a map to a utopia place call 'Dry Land' which happens to be on the back of annoying young child Enola (Tina Majorino) whom Mariner is taking care of, with her mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) because they help him from escaping from being 'recycled' (death sentence) for being an mutant (Half fish, half man). It's a tug of war between Deacon and the Mariner on whom will find Dry Land first. Much of the movie's entertainment factor is found in the well-choreographed action scenes being presented on exceptional sets, which have a strong and specific theme. The movie had beautiful wide shots of endless oceans, giving the movie its Lawrence in the Arabia moment of survivors living in a harsh environment. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazing, its main theme sounds like a savage epic that can be confused with Jurassic Park. Check out the song 'swimming' I didn't expect it to be quite beautiful. 'Escaping the Smokers' has this cool exotic futuristic swashbuckling tone. I'm still puzzled as to why so many people slag this movie off, as people might think the Mariner was too much of an ass. Let's remember, he was a drifter with long periods of loneness, and trust issues way before the two women enter his life, and after they enter, he doesn't know how to deal with them. There is a redemptive arc to him, as he teaching Enola to swim, and end up protecting her from the Smokers. It is everything I would expect if the world flooded and the survivors had to survive. People would band together and yes, people will have the close mindedness to change (Hating mutations). The pedophilia which the term only exists because of modern day society, in post apocalypse with small numbers, girls would be traded off the moment to rebuild population numbers. It makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is in a world that has been covered by water for hundreds of years, how come people still have items from the 20th century and early 21th century only? Not late 21th century or 22 century? Another is the 177 minute director's cut, don't watch it. You're better off watching the theatric version as the movie is too long, and wear down its welcome. The reasons why fans hate it, because it was average for a blockbuster for the time. Plus, it was the most expensive movie ever made. Hence a colossal failure relative to expectations, which turned into the running joke. People that hate it, probably haven't watch the film. If you haven't saw it. You just need to approach it with an open mind, and don't listen to all the bad hype.

    Very interesting idea of a whole world under the sea and what humanity would do if that happened. I was intrigued in the beginning and expected something major. The boats and the water villages are absolutely nicely designed. Unfortunately the movie itself just boils down to lots of shooting, explosions and people dying for no reason. The main character indeed was more evil than good. The bad guys are bad and attack a water village - why? for what? Where do they get food? Where do they get oil for their tanker and the boats? Where do they get bullets for their assault rifles so as to shoot them in such amounts? The movie becomes more and more stupid and illogical. Looks like someone came with nice idea at first but didn't know what to do with it.

    Against popular opinion I don't think this is a awful movie. I hope that we will see a remake of this movie someday. Hollywood instead of remaking for example "Mad Max" should work with movies that had potential like "Water world". Ironically this one is obviously inspired by "Mad Max" , but at least with some originality to it Â– a whole world full of water. It's an really interesting and original idea. "Water world" starts promising with a dark ton (just like "Mad Max" , but unfortunately quickly becomes a fairytale very in Spielberg's style (pirates , orphan , mystical island) . Unfortunately Kevin Reynolds is no Spielberg and "Water world" lacks magic and charm typical for most of Spielberg's movies. Kevin Costner plays here a silent stranger. He's OK as the dead pan, monosyllabic Good Guy. Dennis Hopper gives a hammy , but fun performance as the leader of pirates. Other actors are good. The movie lacks true drama and deeper message . There is some stupidity here (the indestructible raft , the exploding water scooters) still it works as Sunday afternoon entertainment. I give it 5/10.

    Imaginative, But Just A Routine Action/Adventure That Runs Out Of Steam

    "Waterworld" is a very imaginative story. No doubt about that. It's set at some unspecified point in the future on an earth that none of us would recognize. The basic story is that the polar ice caps have completely melted and there's no dry land left - well, except for a perhaps mythical place called - appropriately enough - Dryland. It's implausible (actually, impossible) right from the start. According to my research, even if the polar ice caps did melt the water levels would rise about 200 feet. That's a lot, but there are a lot of things in our world taller than 200 feet - some natural and some man made - so the earth wouldn't be immersed in water to quite this extent. But, hey, it's fiction. It doesn't have to make sense. It has to entertain. For a while, it does that. At first it's interesting enough just to try to get a sense of this world. What's it about? Who lives on it? What sort of "culture" has developed in these conditions? We find out about those things through the eyes of the Mariner (Kevin Costner) - a lone sailor with a pretty interesting boat that seems to have lots of gadgets. Through him we find out about the Smokers - basically pirates - and we discover the atoll - a floating community in the middle of the ocean (but then again, isn't everything in the middle of the ocean if there's only ocean?) where the Mariner comes to trade. Here, he discovers a little girl named Enola (Tina Majorino) and her sort of adoptive mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who want to escape the atoll and search for Dryland. The Mariner gets in trouble, is discovered to be a mutant (with gills and webbed feet) and is about to be killed, when the Smokers attack. They want Enola, because she has a map tattooed on her back that they believe is a map that will lead them to Dryland. Why she has the map tattooed on her back is a bit of a mystery. The first hour or so as we learned about all this was pretty interesting actually. Costner was good; so was Tripplehorn. But the story settled into little more than a routine action/adventure in the last hour or so. Once we had learned the basics about Waterworld, there was nothing more really interesting about it, and action/adventures are pretty commonplace. You need something more to hold the viewers' interest. Yes, there's the search for Dryland, but that really just serves as an excuse for the Smokers to kidnap Enola, and for the Mariner to set out to rescue her. It has all the standard stuff you'd see in any action movie, there's nothing especially dramatic about the end of the search for Dryland, and the plot is full of holes. The first hour isn't too bad; after that I thought this simply ran out of steam. (5/10)

    When I watched this movie, I went in expecting a campy good time with big sets and fun characters. However, when I did see it, I saw an epic character study of not just a small group of people trying to survive, but the entire human race. Actors: Let's face it, there were only two actors in this that you actually wanted to see: Kevin Costner and Dennis Hopper. Kevin Costner: Damn. And I mean damn. This character is a gritty look at what could happen to someone who has been forced into a life of pure hardship because of his differences. While it didn't make too much sense that he was shunned, it still works well. His uncaring attitude reflects his years of isolation out at sea. Dennis Hopper: His rendition of a crazed leader of terrorist-styled organization known as the smokers is just perfect. He's over the top and incredibly hilarious. He really brings something to the performance that I don't think anybody else could have. Script: It's kind of goofy and kid's movie-esque, but, it really brings to light the side of humanity that is still relatively unexplored. You never know how someone might react to something, so really can't say it's too goofy in the context of the film, though. So, while it isn't the best story, it is definitely a worth while story. Overall: Great film. It has its high and low points, but I, personally, think the high points extremely outweigh the low points. Make of it what you will.

    I saw this movie at the drive-in when it first came out. A totally unexpected thrill-ride. I am grateful that films like this exist. Shows the variation in humanity from love and beauty to ugliness and destruction. If somebody gave this film a bad review, it's because they think they think they're smarter than they actually are and they don't know what makes a good film. Kevin Costner, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Dennis Hopper,and Tina Majorino give great performances. I would recommend this film to anybody that is tired of the new film style of quick cut shots, cgi, and unnecessary close ups. The people that gave this movie bad reviews obviously have unreasonable values and expectations, and lack the ability to appreciate a great film. The same people that go through life unhappy, yet telling everybody else how to live.

    The awesome never stops in Waterworld. Costner plays a Man Fish! ...or Merman! Actually considering that he's more mammal than he is fish, he's probably closer to a seal. But then again every homosap is rendered a marine mammal in a big wet world. Costner sails an awesome transformer trimaran that makes the Milleneum Falcon look like a piece of junk. Can the Millennium Falcon sail through space using a giant kite? No! Early in the film, Costner enters a floating junk heap where shark ribs are the meal of the day and dirt is not exactly dirt cheap. But tension rises like a high tide when Costner refuses to whore himself out to a family looking for a seed donor. The water reaches a boiling point when the atollers examine Kevin's ears. Turns out that flotilla folk don't think highly of fish fellas. When Kev has to escape, he gets caught in a particularly clingy relationship with Helen and an unwilling adoptive father of a tatted toddler who has the cutest tattoo you've ever seen. The odd trio find themselves caught between the Deacon and the deep blue sea. The Deacon is a charismatic redneck pirate played here by Dennis Hopper. Problem for Deac is that if Costner's around, these waters are a no smoking zone, so Deacon's Smokers have their waterwork cut out for them. In the eyes of Deacon Hopper, Costner is a turd that won't flush. That's because Costner is a turd that won't go down without a fight. He's a turd that kicks ass. If you're a fan of cute little girls with tattoos, but not in a creepy way, you should check out Waterworld and yes, that is Jack Black as the pilot of the "skyboat."
