    In "Spawn," a pedestrian fantasy thriller, Todd McFarlane's ghoulish menagerie of apocalyptic characters wage the perennial battle of good versus evil. Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping "Spawn" as the next generation super-hero beyond "Batman & Robin." Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as "Spawn" is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions. Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc&eacute;e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of "Beverly Hills Cop 3"). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of "The Pest") forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon. Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of "Excalibur") competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in "Spawn" long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in "Spawn" has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's "Batman." Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of "Darkman" and "The Crow." Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him. If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the "Spawn" characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one. The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, "Spawn" amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of "Spawn" may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

    Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Nicol Williamson, Melinda Clarke and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd McFarlane's comic book. This focuses on government mercenary/assassin, Al Simmons (White) who wants to spend the rest of his life with fianc&eacute;e, Wanda (Randle). After a mission goes unexpectedly, Al tells his corrupt boss, Jason Wynn (Sheen) he wants out, but Wynn asks him to do one last mission in North Korea. Wynn sets him up and has him killed by his right-hand assassin, Priest (Clarke). Al discovers he's been chosen to be hell's ultimate weapon and guided by a demonic clown (Leguizamo). After 5 years, Al returns home badly burned learning that Wanda is married to his best friend, Terry (Sweeney) and have a daughter. Williamson (Return to Oz) plays Cogliostro, a mysterious old man who tries to help Al do good and overcome his hatred and revenge. This isn't great, but not bad and the cast is good in it. I like how some of the characters are named after McFarlane's real-life friends and still recommend this, especially if you're a comic book fan.

    While CG has had an immeasurable effect on movies, it is some debate whether it has been for good or for ill. Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot "Sin City" in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if "Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones" had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly. Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well? "Spawn" is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of "Playing Villains For Dummies" handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read "Faust") while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects. I actually wanted to like "Spawn" but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), "Spawn" might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action "Guyver: Dark Hero" movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then "Spawn" might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based "The Matrix". Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

    I didn't get how this movie wasn't that good well i know why. It was the crappy affect of the monsters. When the clown changed i did not like it cgf. I also did not like the thing that told spawn to lead an army it looked more like a monster in sheep clothing than a big fire demon. Though there were some good parts like the part were spawn fought clown and fought the evil guy. Although the clown was really goofy for a villain the joker is way better than him he would when both killjoy and that clown in a clowning around battle. Killjoy has his own movie too it is not worth renting. I also liked the part were the clown farted and putted stains in his underwear. my brother doe's that it is strange. My rating overall is 6 out of 10 it is worth a c+

    Spawn is an odd film indeed. Taken from a lesser known comic book character this film seemed to come out of nowhere in the late 90's and for all it's worth it does exactly what it say on the tin. Comic book films weren't as widespread as they are now. With the obvious Superman/Batman franchises there wan't much going around that was true comic book material. It's certainly not a great film. The acting s pretty below par (but never truly terrible). Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere. The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are. The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes? As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

    Before I review this, I just want to ask has anybody actually read Spawn? And if so, did you like it? When I mention Spawn to people, they go "Huh?" They never even heard of it. It was a movie not many people saw, based on a comic book not many people read. Good points: Has a good idea. An man gets sent to Hell because he's an assassin and will lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend again. The Alley scenes look cool, the soundtrack's lethal and John Leguizamo's great as Clown. Not to mention him and Michael Jai White had to sit 3 hours in the make up chairs and the prosthetics were a nightmare to wear. Bad points: The acting is terrible. Michael Jai White is great as Al Simmons, but as Spawn, he's too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible. At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers. But is it enjoyable? I thought it was okay. If want to see a good comic book adaptation, then rent a Marvel film out.

    If you've seen the animated series or you've read the comics you know what I mean. Where to start... First of all the cheesiness is just too much to bare and Michael Jai White is awful as spawn and Martin sheen is really bad too,Hell looks awful and the plot is rushed, not very well thought out and not explained very well leaving the viewer confused especially if they haven't read the comics or watched the animated series So why did I gave it 5*? Well I think 3 things saved this from garbage. 1. Clown is awesome in this movie whenever I see this character I forget how bad the film is. 2. The special effects in some off these scenes are really awesome such as when spawn comes crashing through the roof, spawns chains and spawns spikes however the effects of malebolgia and hell are really bad 3. The action scenes are really enjoyable and fun to watch. I really feel if they made a much more serious, longer and better thought out film this movie could have been incredible and I think if this film gets a reboot with the right team it could be a 9 or 10* movie. I highly recommend watching the animated serious over this.

    I remember back in the late 90s, "Spawn" was one of those films that just looked really cool, in the same vein as "Blade" or "The Matrix" (or maybe it's because they all had similar-looking DVD releases). Films like these capitalized greatly on then-impressive special effects, slick cinematic style, frequent action, a dark and Gothic subject matter, and really awesome soundtracks. As cool as "Spawn" seems, however, it's nowhere near as cool as these other films. The coolness of "Spawn" is that it has a lot of action. It doesn't really drag all that much. It has a cool concept behind its antihero character and the overall story; one that offers potential for some epic special effects and some interesting plot twists. And, it has one of the coolest soundtracks on the market. The lameness of "Spawn" is that the dialogue is often very corny, the villains are standard megalomaniacs, the special effects are horrid (even by 1997 standards), a few parts are way too cartoony for its own good (especially regarding the clown character), the style of editing can be pretty erratic and weird, and the film overall is watered down for a PG-13 rating (even the R-rated cut doesn't really push the boundaries much). The thing I find most disconcerting is the execution of the story. The original story for "Spawn" is a pretty dark and compelling drama, on a level similar to "The Crow." It was handled with just the perfect level of respect and quality with the HBO animation. This film takes the material, keeps the core story, but skims over a huge amount of the plot in a short runtime. As such, parts of it are rushed and choppy. Regardless, it does handle a few aspects appropriately. It is inherently compelling to watch the main character suffering betrayal and loss, before being forced to choose between vengeance and morality. It is a story with promise; it's just told in a goofy way. For what it's worth, the photography is not bad. The film is edited with some really weird and fancy editing effects, which can be erratic at times and stylish in others. With the iffy special effects, the film sometimes comes off as appearing rather gaudy. Still, the actors do their best: Michael Jai White brings the Spawn character to life with just the right amount of emotional punch and machismo, while Martin Sheen, John Leguizamo, and Nicol Williamson all put on very hammy performances (for better or for worse). Despite the gaudy CGI, this production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes. Music is really awesome. I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of "Spawn" first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)

    (Note: This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.) 1997's New Line Cinema release "Spawn" is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy. Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light. Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic "Necro-flesh" body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans. The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called "The Violator"). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character. The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background. My major problems with this film fall into several big points. First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and "movie-like" during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time. Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give "Spawn" an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

    The only reason I'm not giving this waste of celluloid a single point is because it is not the worst comic book adaptation. I think that goes got Captain America. Not Joe Johnston's, but Albert Pyun's in 1990. Anyway, this crap is what happens when you get someone like Dippe who came in off Jurassic Park and T2... For CGI. Needless to say, Sheen was seemingly hired to have an A-list name attached. Jai White is at his worst with his best Shatner impersonation, he comes off as surprised he even got the role and it appears that he was picked because he wasn't asking much for a salary. Actually, with his portrayal, he should have done a respectable thing and returned some of it. The "movie" depends too heavily on the outdated CGI and the production design than the actors and story. Then there's Leguizamo who seems so insecure that Dippe told him he was "doing good. Keep that momentum. I see Oscars!" And Leguizamo seems so gullible to believe he was actually stealing the show. There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy.

    In "Spawn," a pedestrian fantasy thriller, Todd McFarlane's ghoulish menagerie of apocalyptic characters wage the perennial battle of good versus evil. Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping "Spawn" as the next generation super-hero beyond "Batman & Robin." Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as "Spawn" is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions. Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc&eacute;e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of "Beverly Hills Cop 3"). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of "The Pest") forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon. Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of "Excalibur") competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in "Spawn" long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in "Spawn" has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's "Batman." Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of "Darkman" and "The Crow." Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him. If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the "Spawn" characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one. The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, "Spawn" amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of "Spawn" may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

    Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Nicol Williamson, Melinda Clarke and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd McFarlane's comic book. This focuses on government mercenary/assassin, Al Simmons (White) who wants to spend the rest of his life with fianc&eacute;e, Wanda (Randle). After a mission goes unexpectedly, Al tells his corrupt boss, Jason Wynn (Sheen) he wants out, but Wynn asks him to do one last mission in North Korea. Wynn sets him up and has him killed by his right-hand assassin, Priest (Clarke). Al discovers he's been chosen to be hell's ultimate weapon and guided by a demonic clown (Leguizamo). After 5 years, Al returns home badly burned learning that Wanda is married to his best friend, Terry (Sweeney) and have a daughter. Williamson (Return to Oz) plays Cogliostro, a mysterious old man who tries to help Al do good and overcome his hatred and revenge. This isn't great, but not bad and the cast is good in it. I like how some of the characters are named after McFarlane's real-life friends and still recommend this, especially if you're a comic book fan.

    While CG has had an immeasurable effect on movies, it is some debate whether it has been for good or for ill. Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot "Sin City" in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if "Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones" had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly. Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well? "Spawn" is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of "Playing Villains For Dummies" handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read "Faust") while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects. I actually wanted to like "Spawn" but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), "Spawn" might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action "Guyver: Dark Hero" movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then "Spawn" might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based "The Matrix". Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

    I didn't get how this movie wasn't that good well i know why. It was the crappy affect of the monsters. When the clown changed i did not like it cgf. I also did not like the thing that told spawn to lead an army it looked more like a monster in sheep clothing than a big fire demon. Though there were some good parts like the part were spawn fought clown and fought the evil guy. Although the clown was really goofy for a villain the joker is way better than him he would when both killjoy and that clown in a clowning around battle. Killjoy has his own movie too it is not worth renting. I also liked the part were the clown farted and putted stains in his underwear. my brother doe's that it is strange. My rating overall is 6 out of 10 it is worth a c+

    Spawn is an odd film indeed. Taken from a lesser known comic book character this film seemed to come out of nowhere in the late 90's and for all it's worth it does exactly what it say on the tin. Comic book films weren't as widespread as they are now. With the obvious Superman/Batman franchises there wan't much going around that was true comic book material. It's certainly not a great film. The acting s pretty below par (but never truly terrible). Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere. The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are. The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes? As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

    Before I review this, I just want to ask has anybody actually read Spawn? And if so, did you like it? When I mention Spawn to people, they go "Huh?" They never even heard of it. It was a movie not many people saw, based on a comic book not many people read. Good points: Has a good idea. An man gets sent to Hell because he's an assassin and will lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend again. The Alley scenes look cool, the soundtrack's lethal and John Leguizamo's great as Clown. Not to mention him and Michael Jai White had to sit 3 hours in the make up chairs and the prosthetics were a nightmare to wear. Bad points: The acting is terrible. Michael Jai White is great as Al Simmons, but as Spawn, he's too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible. At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers. But is it enjoyable? I thought it was okay. If want to see a good comic book adaptation, then rent a Marvel film out.

    If you've seen the animated series or you've read the comics you know what I mean. Where to start... First of all the cheesiness is just too much to bare and Michael Jai White is awful as spawn and Martin sheen is really bad too,Hell looks awful and the plot is rushed, not very well thought out and not explained very well leaving the viewer confused especially if they haven't read the comics or watched the animated series So why did I gave it 5*? Well I think 3 things saved this from garbage. 1. Clown is awesome in this movie whenever I see this character I forget how bad the film is. 2. The special effects in some off these scenes are really awesome such as when spawn comes crashing through the roof, spawns chains and spawns spikes however the effects of malebolgia and hell are really bad 3. The action scenes are really enjoyable and fun to watch. I really feel if they made a much more serious, longer and better thought out film this movie could have been incredible and I think if this film gets a reboot with the right team it could be a 9 or 10* movie. I highly recommend watching the animated serious over this.

    I remember back in the late 90s, "Spawn" was one of those films that just looked really cool, in the same vein as "Blade" or "The Matrix" (or maybe it's because they all had similar-looking DVD releases). Films like these capitalized greatly on then-impressive special effects, slick cinematic style, frequent action, a dark and Gothic subject matter, and really awesome soundtracks. As cool as "Spawn" seems, however, it's nowhere near as cool as these other films. The coolness of "Spawn" is that it has a lot of action. It doesn't really drag all that much. It has a cool concept behind its antihero character and the overall story; one that offers potential for some epic special effects and some interesting plot twists. And, it has one of the coolest soundtracks on the market. The lameness of "Spawn" is that the dialogue is often very corny, the villains are standard megalomaniacs, the special effects are horrid (even by 1997 standards), a few parts are way too cartoony for its own good (especially regarding the clown character), the style of editing can be pretty erratic and weird, and the film overall is watered down for a PG-13 rating (even the R-rated cut doesn't really push the boundaries much). The thing I find most disconcerting is the execution of the story. The original story for "Spawn" is a pretty dark and compelling drama, on a level similar to "The Crow." It was handled with just the perfect level of respect and quality with the HBO animation. This film takes the material, keeps the core story, but skims over a huge amount of the plot in a short runtime. As such, parts of it are rushed and choppy. Regardless, it does handle a few aspects appropriately. It is inherently compelling to watch the main character suffering betrayal and loss, before being forced to choose between vengeance and morality. It is a story with promise; it's just told in a goofy way. For what it's worth, the photography is not bad. The film is edited with some really weird and fancy editing effects, which can be erratic at times and stylish in others. With the iffy special effects, the film sometimes comes off as appearing rather gaudy. Still, the actors do their best: Michael Jai White brings the Spawn character to life with just the right amount of emotional punch and machismo, while Martin Sheen, John Leguizamo, and Nicol Williamson all put on very hammy performances (for better or for worse). Despite the gaudy CGI, this production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes. Music is really awesome. I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of "Spawn" first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)

    (Note: This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.) 1997's New Line Cinema release "Spawn" is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy. Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light. Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic "Necro-flesh" body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans. The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called "The Violator"). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character. The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background. My major problems with this film fall into several big points. First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and "movie-like" during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time. Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give "Spawn" an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

    The only reason I'm not giving this waste of celluloid a single point is because it is not the worst comic book adaptation. I think that goes got Captain America. Not Joe Johnston's, but Albert Pyun's in 1990. Anyway, this crap is what happens when you get someone like Dippe who came in off Jurassic Park and T2... For CGI. Needless to say, Sheen was seemingly hired to have an A-list name attached. Jai White is at his worst with his best Shatner impersonation, he comes off as surprised he even got the role and it appears that he was picked because he wasn't asking much for a salary. Actually, with his portrayal, he should have done a respectable thing and returned some of it. The "movie" depends too heavily on the outdated CGI and the production design than the actors and story. Then there's Leguizamo who seems so insecure that Dippe told him he was "doing good. Keep that momentum. I see Oscars!" And Leguizamo seems so gullible to believe he was actually stealing the show. There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy.

    In "Spawn," a pedestrian fantasy thriller, Todd McFarlane's ghoulish menagerie of apocalyptic characters wage the perennial battle of good versus evil. Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping "Spawn" as the next generation super-hero beyond "Batman & Robin." Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as "Spawn" is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions. Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc&eacute;e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of "Beverly Hills Cop 3"). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of "The Pest") forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon. Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of "Excalibur") competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in "Spawn" long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in "Spawn" has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's "Batman." Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of "Darkman" and "The Crow." Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him. If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the "Spawn" characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one. The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, "Spawn" amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of "Spawn" may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

    Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Nicol Williamson, Melinda Clarke and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd McFarlane's comic book. This focuses on government mercenary/assassin, Al Simmons (White) who wants to spend the rest of his life with fianc&eacute;e, Wanda (Randle). After a mission goes unexpectedly, Al tells his corrupt boss, Jason Wynn (Sheen) he wants out, but Wynn asks him to do one last mission in North Korea. Wynn sets him up and has him killed by his right-hand assassin, Priest (Clarke). Al discovers he's been chosen to be hell's ultimate weapon and guided by a demonic clown (Leguizamo). After 5 years, Al returns home badly burned learning that Wanda is married to his best friend, Terry (Sweeney) and have a daughter. Williamson (Return to Oz) plays Cogliostro, a mysterious old man who tries to help Al do good and overcome his hatred and revenge. This isn't great, but not bad and the cast is good in it. I like how some of the characters are named after McFarlane's real-life friends and still recommend this, especially if you're a comic book fan.

    While CG has had an immeasurable effect on movies, it is some debate whether it has been for good or for ill. Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot "Sin City" in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if "Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones" had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly. Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well? "Spawn" is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of "Playing Villains For Dummies" handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read "Faust") while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects. I actually wanted to like "Spawn" but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), "Spawn" might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action "Guyver: Dark Hero" movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then "Spawn" might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based "The Matrix". Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

    I didn't get how this movie wasn't that good well i know why. It was the crappy affect of the monsters. When the clown changed i did not like it cgf. I also did not like the thing that told spawn to lead an army it looked more like a monster in sheep clothing than a big fire demon. Though there were some good parts like the part were spawn fought clown and fought the evil guy. Although the clown was really goofy for a villain the joker is way better than him he would when both killjoy and that clown in a clowning around battle. Killjoy has his own movie too it is not worth renting. I also liked the part were the clown farted and putted stains in his underwear. my brother doe's that it is strange. My rating overall is 6 out of 10 it is worth a c+

    Spawn is an odd film indeed. Taken from a lesser known comic book character this film seemed to come out of nowhere in the late 90's and for all it's worth it does exactly what it say on the tin. Comic book films weren't as widespread as they are now. With the obvious Superman/Batman franchises there wan't much going around that was true comic book material. It's certainly not a great film. The acting s pretty below par (but never truly terrible). Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere. The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are. The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes? As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

    Before I review this, I just want to ask has anybody actually read Spawn? And if so, did you like it? When I mention Spawn to people, they go "Huh?" They never even heard of it. It was a movie not many people saw, based on a comic book not many people read. Good points: Has a good idea. An man gets sent to Hell because he's an assassin and will lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend again. The Alley scenes look cool, the soundtrack's lethal and John Leguizamo's great as Clown. Not to mention him and Michael Jai White had to sit 3 hours in the make up chairs and the prosthetics were a nightmare to wear. Bad points: The acting is terrible. Michael Jai White is great as Al Simmons, but as Spawn, he's too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible. At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers. But is it enjoyable? I thought it was okay. If want to see a good comic book adaptation, then rent a Marvel film out.

    If you've seen the animated series or you've read the comics you know what I mean. Where to start... First of all the cheesiness is just too much to bare and Michael Jai White is awful as spawn and Martin sheen is really bad too,Hell looks awful and the plot is rushed, not very well thought out and not explained very well leaving the viewer confused especially if they haven't read the comics or watched the animated series So why did I gave it 5*? Well I think 3 things saved this from garbage. 1. Clown is awesome in this movie whenever I see this character I forget how bad the film is. 2. The special effects in some off these scenes are really awesome such as when spawn comes crashing through the roof, spawns chains and spawns spikes however the effects of malebolgia and hell are really bad 3. The action scenes are really enjoyable and fun to watch. I really feel if they made a much more serious, longer and better thought out film this movie could have been incredible and I think if this film gets a reboot with the right team it could be a 9 or 10* movie. I highly recommend watching the animated serious over this.

    I remember back in the late 90s, "Spawn" was one of those films that just looked really cool, in the same vein as "Blade" or "The Matrix" (or maybe it's because they all had similar-looking DVD releases). Films like these capitalized greatly on then-impressive special effects, slick cinematic style, frequent action, a dark and Gothic subject matter, and really awesome soundtracks. As cool as "Spawn" seems, however, it's nowhere near as cool as these other films. The coolness of "Spawn" is that it has a lot of action. It doesn't really drag all that much. It has a cool concept behind its antihero character and the overall story; one that offers potential for some epic special effects and some interesting plot twists. And, it has one of the coolest soundtracks on the market. The lameness of "Spawn" is that the dialogue is often very corny, the villains are standard megalomaniacs, the special effects are horrid (even by 1997 standards), a few parts are way too cartoony for its own good (especially regarding the clown character), the style of editing can be pretty erratic and weird, and the film overall is watered down for a PG-13 rating (even the R-rated cut doesn't really push the boundaries much). The thing I find most disconcerting is the execution of the story. The original story for "Spawn" is a pretty dark and compelling drama, on a level similar to "The Crow." It was handled with just the perfect level of respect and quality with the HBO animation. This film takes the material, keeps the core story, but skims over a huge amount of the plot in a short runtime. As such, parts of it are rushed and choppy. Regardless, it does handle a few aspects appropriately. It is inherently compelling to watch the main character suffering betrayal and loss, before being forced to choose between vengeance and morality. It is a story with promise; it's just told in a goofy way. For what it's worth, the photography is not bad. The film is edited with some really weird and fancy editing effects, which can be erratic at times and stylish in others. With the iffy special effects, the film sometimes comes off as appearing rather gaudy. Still, the actors do their best: Michael Jai White brings the Spawn character to life with just the right amount of emotional punch and machismo, while Martin Sheen, John Leguizamo, and Nicol Williamson all put on very hammy performances (for better or for worse). Despite the gaudy CGI, this production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes. Music is really awesome. I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of "Spawn" first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)

    (Note: This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.) 1997's New Line Cinema release "Spawn" is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy. Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light. Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic "Necro-flesh" body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans. The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called "The Violator"). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character. The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background. My major problems with this film fall into several big points. First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and "movie-like" during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time. Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give "Spawn" an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

    The only reason I'm not giving this waste of celluloid a single point is because it is not the worst comic book adaptation. I think that goes got Captain America. Not Joe Johnston's, but Albert Pyun's in 1990. Anyway, this crap is what happens when you get someone like Dippe who came in off Jurassic Park and T2... For CGI. Needless to say, Sheen was seemingly hired to have an A-list name attached. Jai White is at his worst with his best Shatner impersonation, he comes off as surprised he even got the role and it appears that he was picked because he wasn't asking much for a salary. Actually, with his portrayal, he should have done a respectable thing and returned some of it. The "movie" depends too heavily on the outdated CGI and the production design than the actors and story. Then there's Leguizamo who seems so insecure that Dippe told him he was "doing good. Keep that momentum. I see Oscars!" And Leguizamo seems so gullible to believe he was actually stealing the show. There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy.

    In "Spawn," a pedestrian fantasy thriller, Todd McFarlane's ghoulish menagerie of apocalyptic characters wage the perennial battle of good versus evil. Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping "Spawn" as the next generation super-hero beyond "Batman & Robin." Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as "Spawn" is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions. Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc&eacute;e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of "Beverly Hills Cop 3"). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of "The Pest") forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon. Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of "Excalibur") competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in "Spawn" long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in "Spawn" has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's "Batman." Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of "Darkman" and "The Crow." Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him. If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the "Spawn" characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one. The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, "Spawn" amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of "Spawn" may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

    Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Nicol Williamson, Melinda Clarke and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd McFarlane's comic book. This focuses on government mercenary/assassin, Al Simmons (White) who wants to spend the rest of his life with fianc&eacute;e, Wanda (Randle). After a mission goes unexpectedly, Al tells his corrupt boss, Jason Wynn (Sheen) he wants out, but Wynn asks him to do one last mission in North Korea. Wynn sets him up and has him killed by his right-hand assassin, Priest (Clarke). Al discovers he's been chosen to be hell's ultimate weapon and guided by a demonic clown (Leguizamo). After 5 years, Al returns home badly burned learning that Wanda is married to his best friend, Terry (Sweeney) and have a daughter. Williamson (Return to Oz) plays Cogliostro, a mysterious old man who tries to help Al do good and overcome his hatred and revenge. This isn't great, but not bad and the cast is good in it. I like how some of the characters are named after McFarlane's real-life friends and still recommend this, especially if you're a comic book fan.

    While CG has had an immeasurable effect on movies, it is some debate whether it has been for good or for ill. Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot "Sin City" in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if "Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones" had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly. Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well? "Spawn" is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of "Playing Villains For Dummies" handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read "Faust") while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects. I actually wanted to like "Spawn" but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), "Spawn" might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action "Guyver: Dark Hero" movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then "Spawn" might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based "The Matrix". Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere. The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are. The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes? As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

    Before I review this, I just want to ask has anybody actually read Spawn? And if so, did you like it? When I mention Spawn to people, they go "Huh?" They never even heard of it. It was a movie not many people saw, based on a comic book not many people read. Good points: Has a good idea. An man gets sent to Hell because he's an assassin and will lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend again. The Alley scenes look cool, the soundtrack's lethal and John Leguizamo's great as Clown. Not to mention him and Michael Jai White had to sit 3 hours in the make up chairs and the prosthetics were a nightmare to wear. Bad points: The acting is terrible. Michael Jai White is great as Al Simmons, but as Spawn, he's too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible. At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers. But is it enjoyable? I thought it was okay. If want to see a good comic book adaptation, then rent a Marvel film out.

    If you've seen the animated series or you've read the comics you know what I mean. Where to start... First of all the cheesiness is just too much to bare and Michael Jai White is awful as spawn and Martin sheen is really bad too,Hell looks awful and the plot is rushed, not very well thought out and not explained very well leaving the viewer confused especially if they haven't read the comics or watched the animated series So why did I gave it 5*? Well I think 3 things saved this from garbage. 1. Clown is awesome in this movie whenever I see this character I forget how bad the film is. 2. The special effects in some off these scenes are really awesome such as when spawn comes crashing through the roof, spawns chains and spawns spikes however the effects of malebolgia and hell are really bad 3. The action scenes are really enjoyable and fun to watch. I really feel if they made a much more serious, longer and better thought out film this movie could have been incredible and I think if this film gets a reboot with the right team it could be a 9 or 10* movie. I highly recommend watching the animated serious over this.

    I remember back in the late 90s, "Spawn" was one of those films that just looked really cool, in the same vein as "Blade" or "The Matrix" (or maybe it's because they all had similar-looking DVD releases). Films like these capitalized greatly on then-impressive special effects, slick cinematic style, frequent action, a dark and Gothic subject matter, and really awesome soundtracks. As cool as "Spawn" seems, however, it's nowhere near as cool as these other films. The coolness of "Spawn" is that it has a lot of action. It doesn't really drag all that much. It has a cool concept behind its antihero character and the overall story; one that offers potential for some epic special effects and some interesting plot twists. And, it has one of the coolest soundtracks on the market. The lameness of "Spawn" is that the dialogue is often very corny, the villains are standard megalomaniacs, the special effects are horrid (even by 1997 standards), a few parts are way too cartoony for its own good (especially regarding the clown character), the style of editing can be pretty erratic and weird, and the film overall is watered down for a PG-13 rating (even the R-rated cut doesn't really push the boundaries much). The thing I find most disconcerting is the execution of the story. The original story for "Spawn" is a pretty dark and compelling drama, on a level similar to "The Crow." It was handled with just the perfect level of respect and quality with the HBO animation. This film takes the material, keeps the core story, but skims over a huge amount of the plot in a short runtime. As such, parts of it are rushed and choppy. Regardless, it does handle a few aspects appropriately. It is inherently compelling to watch the main character suffering betrayal and loss, before being forced to choose between vengeance and morality. It is a story with promise; it's just told in a goofy way. For what it's worth, the photography is not bad. The film is edited with some really weird and fancy editing effects, which can be erratic at times and stylish in others. With the iffy special effects, the film sometimes comes off as appearing rather gaudy. Still, the actors do their best: Michael Jai White brings the Spawn character to life with just the right amount of emotional punch and machismo, while Martin Sheen, John Leguizamo, and Nicol Williamson all put on very hammy performances (for better or for worse). Despite the gaudy CGI, this production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes. Music is really awesome. I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of "Spawn" first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)

    (Note: This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.) 1997's New Line Cinema release "Spawn" is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy. Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light. Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic "Necro-flesh" body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans. The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called "The Violator"). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character. The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background. My major problems with this film fall into several big points. First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and "movie-like" during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time. Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give "Spawn" an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

    The only reason I'm not giving this waste of celluloid a single point is because it is not the worst comic book adaptation. I think that goes got Captain America. Not Joe Johnston's, but Albert Pyun's in 1990. Anyway, this crap is what happens when you get someone like Dippe who came in off Jurassic Park and T2... For CGI. Needless to say, Sheen was seemingly hired to have an A-list name attached. Jai White is at his worst with his best Shatner impersonation, he comes off as surprised he even got the role and it appears that he was picked because he wasn't asking much for a salary. Actually, with his portrayal, he should have done a respectable thing and returned some of it. The "movie" depends too heavily on the outdated CGI and the production design than the actors and story. Then there's Leguizamo who seems so insecure that Dippe told him he was "doing good. Keep that momentum. I see Oscars!" And Leguizamo seems so gullible to believe he was actually stealing the show. There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy.

    In "Spawn," a pedestrian fantasy thriller, Todd McFarlane's ghoulish menagerie of apocalyptic characters wage the perennial battle of good versus evil. Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping "Spawn" as the next generation super-hero beyond "Batman & Robin." Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as "Spawn" is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions. Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc&eacute;e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of "Beverly Hills Cop 3"). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of "The Pest") forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon. Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of "Excalibur") competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in "Spawn" long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in "Spawn" has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's "Batman." Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of "Darkman" and "The Crow." Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him. If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the "Spawn" characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one. The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, "Spawn" amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of "Spawn" may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

    Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Nicol Williamson, Melinda Clarke and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd McFarlane's comic book. This focuses on government mercenary/assassin, Al Simmons (White) who wants to spend the rest of his life with fianc&eacute;e, Wanda (Randle). After a mission goes unexpectedly, Al tells his corrupt boss, Jason Wynn (Sheen) he wants out, but Wynn asks him to do one last mission in North Korea. Wynn sets him up and has him killed by his right-hand assassin, Priest (Clarke). Al discovers he's been chosen to be hell's ultimate weapon and guided by a demonic clown (Leguizamo). After 5 years, Al returns home badly burned learning that Wanda is married to his best friend, Terry (Sweeney) and have a daughter. Williamson (Return to Oz) plays Cogliostro, a mysterious old man who tries to help Al do good and overcome his hatred and revenge. This isn't great, but not bad and the cast is good in it. I like how some of the characters are named after McFarlane's real-life friends and still recommend this, especially if you're a comic book fan.

    While CG has had an immeasurable effect on movies, it is some debate whether it has been for good or for ill. Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot "Sin City" in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if "Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones" had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly. Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well? "Spawn" is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of "Playing Villains For Dummies" handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read "Faust") while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects. I actually wanted to like "Spawn" but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), "Spawn" might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action "Guyver: Dark Hero" movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then "Spawn" might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based "The Matrix". Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

    I didn't get how this movie wasn't that good well i know why. It was the crappy affect of the monsters. When the clown changed i did not like it cgf. I also did not like the thing that told spawn to lead an army it looked more like a monster in sheep clothing than a big fire demon. Though there were some good parts like the part were spawn fought clown and fought the evil guy. Although the clown was really goofy for a villain the joker is way better than him he would when both killjoy and that clown in a clowning around battle. Killjoy has his own movie too it is not worth renting. I also liked the part were the clown farted and putted stains in his underwear. my brother doe's that it is strange. My rating overall is 6 out of 10 it is worth a c+

    Spawn is an odd film indeed. Taken from a lesser known comic book character this film seemed to come out of nowhere in the late 90's and for all it's worth it does exactly what it say on the tin. Comic book films weren't as widespread as they are now. With the obvious Superman/Batman franchises there wan't much going around that was true comic book material. It's certainly not a great film. The acting s pretty below par (but never truly terrible). Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere. The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are. The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes? As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

    Before I review this, I just want to ask has anybody actually read Spawn? And if so, did you like it? When I mention Spawn to people, they go "Huh?" They never even heard of it. It was a movie not many people saw, based on a comic book not many people read. Good points: Has a good idea. An man gets sent to Hell because he's an assassin and will lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend again. The Alley scenes look cool, the soundtrack's lethal and John Leguizamo's great as Clown. Not to mention him and Michael Jai White had to sit 3 hours in the make up chairs and the prosthetics were a nightmare to wear. Bad points: The acting is terrible. Michael Jai White is great as Al Simmons, but as Spawn, he's too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible. At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers. But is it enjoyable? I thought it was okay. If want to see a good comic book adaptation, then rent a Marvel film out.

The action scenes are really enjoyable and fun to watch. I really feel if they made a much more serious, longer and better thought out film this movie could have been incredible and I think if this film gets a reboot with the right team it could be a 9 or 10* movie. I highly recommend watching the animated serious over this.

    I remember back in the late 90s, "Spawn" was one of those films that just looked really cool, in the same vein as "Blade" or "The Matrix" (or maybe it's because they all had similar-looking DVD releases). Films like these capitalized greatly on then-impressive special effects, slick cinematic style, frequent action, a dark and Gothic subject matter, and really awesome soundtracks. As cool as "Spawn" seems, however, it's nowhere near as cool as these other films. The coolness of "Spawn" is that it has a lot of action. It doesn't really drag all that much. It has a cool concept behind its antihero character and the overall story; one that offers potential for some epic special effects and some interesting plot twists. And, it has one of the coolest soundtracks on the market. The lameness of "Spawn" is that the dialogue is often very corny, the villains are standard megalomaniacs, the special effects are horrid (even by 1997 standards), a few parts are way too cartoony for its own good (especially regarding the clown character), the style of editing can be pretty erratic and weird, and the film overall is watered down for a PG-13 rating (even the R-rated cut doesn't really push the boundaries much). The thing I find most disconcerting is the execution of the story. The original story for "Spawn" is a pretty dark and compelling drama, on a level similar to "The Crow." It was handled with just the perfect level of respect and quality with the HBO animation. This film takes the material, keeps the core story, but skims over a huge amount of the plot in a short runtime. As such, parts of it are rushed and choppy. Regardless, it does handle a few aspects appropriately. It is inherently compelling to watch the main character suffering betrayal and loss, before being forced to choose between vengeance and morality. It is a story with promise; it's just told in a goofy way. For what it's worth, the photography is not bad. The film is edited with some really weird and fancy editing effects, which can be erratic at times and stylish in others. With the iffy special effects, the film sometimes comes off as appearing rather gaudy. Still, the actors do their best: Michael Jai White brings the Spawn character to life with just the right amount of emotional punch and machismo, while Martin Sheen, John Leguizamo, and Nicol Williamson all put on very hammy performances (for better or for worse). Despite the gaudy CGI, this production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes. Music is really awesome. I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of "Spawn" first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)

    (Note: This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.) 1997's New Line Cinema release "Spawn" is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy. Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light. Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic "Necro-flesh" body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans. The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called "The Violator"). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character. The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background. My major problems with this film fall into several big points. First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and "movie-like" during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time. Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give "Spawn" an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

    The only reason I'm not giving this waste of celluloid a single point is because it is not the worst comic book adaptation. I think that goes got Captain America. Not Joe Johnston's, but Albert Pyun's in 1990. Anyway, this crap is what happens when you get someone like Dippe who came in off Jurassic Park and T2... For CGI. Needless to say, Sheen was seemingly hired to have an A-list name attached. Jai White is at his worst with his best Shatner impersonation, he comes off as surprised he even got the role and it appears that he was picked because he wasn't asking much for a salary. Actually, with his portrayal, he should have done a respectable thing and returned some of it. The "movie" depends too heavily on the outdated CGI and the production design than the actors and story. Then there's Leguizamo who seems so insecure that Dippe told him he was "doing good. Keep that momentum. I see Oscars!" And Leguizamo seems so gullible to believe he was actually stealing the show. There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy.

    In "Spawn," a pedestrian fantasy thriller, Todd McFarlane's ghoulish menagerie of apocalyptic characters wage the perennial battle of good versus evil. Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping "Spawn" as the next generation super-hero beyond "Batman & Robin." Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as "Spawn" is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions. Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc&eacute;e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of "Beverly Hills Cop 3"). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of "The Pest") forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon. Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of "Excalibur") competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in "Spawn" long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in "Spawn" has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's "Batman." Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of "Darkman" and "The Crow." Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him. If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the "Spawn" characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one. The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, "Spawn" amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of "Spawn" may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

    Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Nicol Williamson, Melinda Clarke and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd McFarlane's comic book. This focuses on government mercenary/assassin, Al Simmons (White) who wants to spend the rest of his life with fianc&eacute;e, Wanda (Randle). After a mission goes unexpectedly, Al tells his corrupt boss, Jason Wynn (Sheen) he wants out, but Wynn asks him to do one last mission in North Korea. Wynn sets him up and has him killed by his right-hand assassin, Priest (Clarke). Al discovers he's been chosen to be hell's ultimate weapon and guided by a demonic clown (Leguizamo). After 5 years, Al returns home badly burned learning that Wanda is married to his best friend, Terry (Sweeney) and have a daughter. Williamson (Return to Oz) plays Cogliostro, a mysterious old man who tries to help Al do good and overcome his hatred and revenge. This isn't great, but not bad and the cast is good in it. I like how some of the characters are named after McFarlane's real-life friends and still recommend this, especially if you're a comic book fan.

    While CG has had an immeasurable effect on movies, it is some debate whether it has been for good or for ill. Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot "Sin City" in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if "Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones" had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly. Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well? "Spawn" is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of "Playing Villains For Dummies" handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read "Faust") while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects. I actually wanted to like "Spawn" but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), "Spawn" might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action "Guyver: Dark Hero" movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then "Spawn" might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based "The Matrix". Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

    I didn't get how this movie wasn't that good well i know why. It was the crappy affect of the monsters. When the clown changed i did not like it cgf. I also did not like the thing that told spawn to lead an army it looked more like a monster in sheep clothing than a big fire demon. Though there were some good parts like the part were spawn fought clown and fought the evil guy. Although the clown was really goofy for a villain the joker is way better than him he would when both killjoy and that clown in a clowning around battle. Killjoy has his own movie too it is not worth renting. I also liked the part were the clown farted and putted stains in his underwear. my brother doe's that it is strange. My rating overall is 6 out of 10 it is worth a c+

    Spawn is an odd film indeed. Taken from a lesser known comic book character this film seemed to come out of nowhere in the late 90's and for all it's worth it does exactly what it say on the tin. Comic book films weren't as widespread as they are now. With the obvious Superman/Batman franchises there wan't much going around that was true comic book material. It's certainly not a great film. The acting s pretty below par (but never truly terrible). Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere. The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are. The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes? As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

    Before I review this, I just want to ask has anybody actually read Spawn? And if so, did you like it? When I mention Spawn to people, they go "Huh?" They never even heard of it. It was a movie not many people saw, based on a comic book not many people read. Good points: Has a good idea. An man gets sent to Hell because he's an assassin and will lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend again. The Alley scenes look cool, the soundtrack's lethal and John Leguizamo's great as Clown. Not to mention him and Michael Jai White had to sit 3 hours in the make up chairs and the prosthetics were a nightmare to wear. Bad points: The acting is terrible. Michael Jai White is great as Al Simmons, but as Spawn, he's too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible. At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers. But is it enjoyable? I thought it was okay. If want to see a good comic book adaptation, then rent a Marvel film out.

    If you've seen the animated series or you've read the comics you know what I mean. Where to start... First of all the cheesiness is just too much to bare and Michael Jai White is awful as spawn and Martin sheen is really bad too,Hell looks awful and the plot is rushed, not very well thought out and not explained very well leaving the viewer confused especially if they haven't read the comics or watched the animated series So why did I gave it 5*? Well I think 3 things saved this from garbage. 1. Clown is awesome in this movie whenever I see this character I forget how bad the film is. 2. The special effects in some off these scenes are really awesome such as when spawn comes crashing through the roof, spawns chains and spawns spikes however the effects of malebolgia and hell are really bad 3. The action scenes are really enjoyable and fun to watch. I really feel if they made a much more serious, longer and better thought out film this movie could have been incredible and I think if this film gets a reboot with the right team it could be a 9 or 10* movie. I highly recommend watching the animated serious over this.

I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of "Spawn" first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)

    (Note: This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.) 1997's New Line Cinema release "Spawn" is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy. Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light. Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic "Necro-flesh" body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans. The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called "The Violator"). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character. The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background. My major problems with this film fall into several big points. First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and "movie-like" during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time. Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give "Spawn" an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

    The only reason I'm not giving this waste of celluloid a single point is because it is not the worst comic book adaptation. I think that goes got Captain America. Not Joe Johnston's, but Albert Pyun's in 1990. Anyway, this crap is what happens when you get someone like Dippe who came in off Jurassic Park and T2... For CGI. Needless to say, Sheen was seemingly hired to have an A-list name attached. Jai White is at his worst with his best Shatner impersonation, he comes off as surprised he even got the role and it appears that he was picked because he wasn't asking much for a salary. Actually, with his portrayal, he should have done a respectable thing and returned some of it. The "movie" depends too heavily on the outdated CGI and the production design than the actors and story. Then there's Leguizamo who seems so insecure that Dippe told him he was "doing good. Keep that momentum. I see Oscars!" And Leguizamo seems so gullible to believe he was actually stealing the show. There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy.

    In "Spawn," a pedestrian fantasy thriller, Todd McFarlane's ghoulish menagerie of apocalyptic characters wage the perennial battle of good versus evil. Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping "Spawn" as the next generation super-hero beyond "Batman & Robin." Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as "Spawn" is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions. Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc&eacute;e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of "Beverly Hills Cop 3"). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of "The Pest") forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon. Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of "Excalibur") competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in "Spawn" long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in "Spawn" has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's "Batman." Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of "Darkman" and "The Crow." Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him. If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the "Spawn" characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one. The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, "Spawn" amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of "Spawn" may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

    Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Nicol Williamson, Melinda Clarke and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd McFarlane's comic book. This focuses on government mercenary/assassin, Al Simmons (White) who wants to spend the rest of his life with fianc&eacute;e, Wanda (Randle). After a mission goes unexpectedly, Al tells his corrupt boss, Jason Wynn (Sheen) he wants out, but Wynn asks him to do one last mission in North Korea. Wynn sets him up and has him killed by his right-hand assassin, Priest (Clarke). Al discovers he's been chosen to be hell's ultimate weapon and guided by a demonic clown (Leguizamo). After 5 years, Al returns home badly burned learning that Wanda is married to his best friend, Terry (Sweeney) and have a daughter. Williamson (Return to Oz) plays Cogliostro, a mysterious old man who tries to help Al do good and overcome his hatred and revenge. This isn't great, but not bad and the cast is good in it. I like how some of the characters are named after McFarlane's real-life friends and still recommend this, especially if you're a comic book fan.

    While CG has had an immeasurable effect on movies, it is some debate whether it has been for good or for ill. Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot "Sin City" in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if "Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones" had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly. Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well? "Spawn" is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of "Playing Villains For Dummies" handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read "Faust") while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects. I actually wanted to like "Spawn" but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), "Spawn" might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action "Guyver: Dark Hero" movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then "Spawn" might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based "The Matrix". Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

    I didn't get how this movie wasn't that good well i know why. It was the crappy affect of the monsters. When the clown changed i did not like it cgf. I also did not like the thing that told spawn to lead an army it looked more like a monster in sheep clothing than a big fire demon. Though there were some good parts like the part were spawn fought clown and fought the evil guy. Although the clown was really goofy for a villain the joker is way better than him he would when both killjoy and that clown in a clowning around battle. Killjoy has his own movie too it is not worth renting. I also liked the part were the clown farted and putted stains in his underwear. my brother doe's that it is strange. My rating overall is 6 out of 10 it is worth a c+

    Spawn is an odd film indeed. Taken from a lesser known comic book character this film seemed to come out of nowhere in the late 90's and for all it's worth it does exactly what it say on the tin. Comic book films weren't as widespread as they are now. With the obvious Superman/Batman franchises there wan't much going around that was true comic book material. It's certainly not a great film. The acting s pretty below par (but never truly terrible). Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere. The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are. The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes? As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

    Before I review this, I just want to ask has anybody actually read Spawn? And if so, did you like it? When I mention Spawn to people, they go "Huh?" They never even heard of it. It was a movie not many people saw, based on a comic book not many people read. Good points: Has a good idea. An man gets sent to Hell because he's an assassin and will lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend again. The Alley scenes look cool, the soundtrack's lethal and John Leguizamo's great as Clown. Not to mention him and Michael Jai White had to sit 3 hours in the make up chairs and the prosthetics were a nightmare to wear. Bad points: The acting is terrible. Michael Jai White is great as Al Simmons, but as Spawn, he's too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible. At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers. But is it enjoyable? I thought it was okay. If want to see a good comic book adaptation, then rent a Marvel film out.

    If you've seen the animated series or you've read the comics you know what I mean. Where to start... First of all the cheesiness is just too much to bare and Michael Jai White is awful as spawn and Martin sheen is really bad too,Hell looks awful and the plot is rushed, not very well thought out and not explained very well leaving the viewer confused especially if they haven't read the comics or watched the animated series So why did I gave it 5*? Well I think 3 things saved this from garbage. 1. Clown is awesome in this movie whenever I see this character I forget how bad the film is. 2. The special effects in some off these scenes are really awesome such as when spawn comes crashing through the roof, spawns chains and spawns spikes however the effects of malebolgia and hell are really bad 3. The action scenes are really enjoyable and fun to watch. I really feel if they made a much more serious, longer and better thought out film this movie could have been incredible and I think if this film gets a reboot with the right team it could be a 9 or 10* movie. I highly recommend watching the animated serious over this.

    I remember back in the late 90s, "Spawn" was one of those films that just looked really cool, in the same vein as "Blade" or "The Matrix" (or maybe it's because they all had similar-looking DVD releases). Films like these capitalized greatly on then-impressive special effects, slick cinematic style, frequent action, a dark and Gothic subject matter, and really awesome soundtracks. As cool as "Spawn" seems, however, it's nowhere near as cool as these other films. The coolness of "Spawn" is that it has a lot of action. It doesn't really drag all that much. It has a cool concept behind its antihero character and the overall story; one that offers potential for some epic special effects and some interesting plot twists. And, it has one of the coolest soundtracks on the market. The lameness of "Spawn" is that the dialogue is often very corny, the villains are standard megalomaniacs, the special effects are horrid (even by 1997 standards), a few parts are way too cartoony for its own good (especially regarding the clown character), the style of editing can be pretty erratic and weird, and the film overall is watered down for a PG-13 rating (even the R-rated cut doesn't really push the boundaries much). The thing I find most disconcerting is the execution of the story. The original story for "Spawn" is a pretty dark and compelling drama, on a level similar to "The Crow." It was handled with just the perfect level of respect and quality with the HBO animation. This film takes the material, keeps the core story, but skims over a huge amount of the plot in a short runtime. As such, parts of it are rushed and choppy. Regardless, it does handle a few aspects appropriately. It is inherently compelling to watch the main character suffering betrayal and loss, before being forced to choose between vengeance and morality. It is a story with promise; it's just told in a goofy way. For what it's worth, the photography is not bad. The film is edited with some really weird and fancy editing effects, which can be erratic at times and stylish in others. With the iffy special effects, the film sometimes comes off as appearing rather gaudy. Still, the actors do their best: Michael Jai White brings the Spawn character to life with just the right amount of emotional punch and machismo, while Martin Sheen, John Leguizamo, and Nicol Williamson all put on very hammy performances (for better or for worse). Despite the gaudy CGI, this production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes. Music is really awesome. I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of "Spawn" first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)

    (Note: This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.) 1997's New Line Cinema release "Spawn" is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy. Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light. Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic "Necro-flesh" body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans. The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called "The Violator"). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character. The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background. My major problems with this film fall into several big points. First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and "movie-like" during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time. Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give "Spawn" an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy.

    In "Spawn," a pedestrian fantasy thriller, Todd McFarlane's ghoulish menagerie of apocalyptic characters wage the perennial battle of good versus evil. Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping "Spawn" as the next generation super-hero beyond "Batman & Robin." Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as "Spawn" is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions. Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc&eacute;e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of "Beverly Hills Cop 3"). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of "The Pest") forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon. Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of "Excalibur") competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in "Spawn" long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in "Spawn" has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's "Batman." Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of "Darkman" and "The Crow." Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him. If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the "Spawn" characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one. The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, "Spawn" amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of "Spawn" may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

    Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Nicol Williamson, Melinda Clarke and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd McFarlane's comic book. This focuses on government mercenary/assassin, Al Simmons (White) who wants to spend the rest of his life with fianc&eacute;e, Wanda (Randle). After a mission goes unexpectedly, Al tells his corrupt boss, Jason Wynn (Sheen) he wants out, but Wynn asks him to do one last mission in North Korea. Wynn sets him up and has him killed by his right-hand assassin, Priest (Clarke). Al discovers he's been chosen to be hell's ultimate weapon and guided by a demonic clown (Leguizamo). After 5 years, Al returns home badly burned learning that Wanda is married to his best friend, Terry (Sweeney) and have a daughter. Williamson (Return to Oz) plays Cogliostro, a mysterious old man who tries to help Al do good and overcome his hatred and revenge. This isn't great, but not bad and the cast is good in it. I like how some of the characters are named after McFarlane's real-life friends and still recommend this, especially if you're a comic book fan.

    While CG has had an immeasurable effect on movies, it is some debate whether it has been for good or for ill. Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot "Sin City" in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if "Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones" had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly. Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well? "Spawn" is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of "Playing Villains For Dummies" handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read "Faust") while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects. I actually wanted to like "Spawn" but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), "Spawn" might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action "Guyver: Dark Hero" movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then "Spawn" might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based "The Matrix". Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

    I didn't get how this movie wasn't that good well i know why. It was the crappy affect of the monsters. When the clown changed i did not like it cgf. I also did not like the thing that told spawn to lead an army it looked more like a monster in sheep clothing than a big fire demon. Though there were some good parts like the part were spawn fought clown and fought the evil guy. Although the clown was really goofy for a villain the joker is way better than him he would when both killjoy and that clown in a clowning around battle. Killjoy has his own movie too it is not worth renting. I also liked the part were the clown farted and putted stains in his underwear. my brother doe's that it is strange. My rating overall is 6 out of 10 it is worth a c+

    Spawn is an odd film indeed. Taken from a lesser known comic book character this film seemed to come out of nowhere in the late 90's and for all it's worth it does exactly what it say on the tin. Comic book films weren't as widespread as they are now. With the obvious Superman/Batman franchises there wan't much going around that was true comic book material. It's certainly not a great film. The acting s pretty below par (but never truly terrible). Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere. The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are. The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes? As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

    Before I review this, I just want to ask has anybody actually read Spawn? And if so, did you like it? When I mention Spawn to people, they go "Huh?" They never even heard of it. It was a movie not many people saw, based on a comic book not many people read. Good points: Has a good idea. An man gets sent to Hell because he's an assassin and will lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend again. The Alley scenes look cool, the soundtrack's lethal and John Leguizamo's great as Clown. Not to mention him and Michael Jai White had to sit 3 hours in the make up chairs and the prosthetics were a nightmare to wear. Bad points: The acting is terrible. Michael Jai White is great as Al Simmons, but as Spawn, he's too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible. At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers. But is it enjoyable? I thought it was okay. If want to see a good comic book adaptation, then rent a Marvel film out.

    If you've seen the animated series or you've read the comics you know what I mean. Where to start... First of all the cheesiness is just too much to bare and Michael Jai White is awful as spawn and Martin sheen is really bad too,Hell looks awful and the plot is rushed, not very well thought out and not explained very well leaving the viewer confused especially if they haven't read the comics or watched the animated series So why did I gave it 5*? Well I think 3 things saved this from garbage. 1. Clown is awesome in this movie whenever I see this character I forget how bad the film is. 2. The special effects in some off these scenes are really awesome such as when spawn comes crashing through the roof, spawns chains and spawns spikes however the effects of malebolgia and hell are really bad 3. The action scenes are really enjoyable and fun to watch. I really feel if they made a much more serious, longer and better thought out film this movie could have been incredible and I think if this film gets a reboot with the right team it could be a 9 or 10* movie. I highly recommend watching the animated serious over this.

    I remember back in the late 90s, "Spawn" was one of those films that just looked really cool, in the same vein as "Blade" or "The Matrix" (or maybe it's because they all had similar-looking DVD releases). Films like these capitalized greatly on then-impressive special effects, slick cinematic style, frequent action, a dark and Gothic subject matter, and really awesome soundtracks. As cool as "Spawn" seems, however, it's nowhere near as cool as these other films. The coolness of "Spawn" is that it has a lot of action. It doesn't really drag all that much. It has a cool concept behind its antihero character and the overall story; one that offers potential for some epic special effects and some interesting plot twists. And, it has one of the coolest soundtracks on the market. The lameness of "Spawn" is that the dialogue is often very corny, the villains are standard megalomaniacs, the special effects are horrid (even by 1997 standards), a few parts are way too cartoony for its own good (especially regarding the clown character), the style of editing can be pretty erratic and weird, and the film overall is watered down for a PG-13 rating (even the R-rated cut doesn't really push the boundaries much). The thing I find most disconcerting is the execution of the story. The original story for "Spawn" is a pretty dark and compelling drama, on a level similar to "The Crow." It was handled with just the perfect level of respect and quality with the HBO animation. This film takes the material, keeps the core story, but skims over a huge amount of the plot in a short runtime. As such, parts of it are rushed and choppy. Regardless, it does handle a few aspects appropriately. It is inherently compelling to watch the main character suffering betrayal and loss, before being forced to choose between vengeance and morality. It is a story with promise; it's just told in a goofy way. For what it's worth, the photography is not bad. The film is edited with some really weird and fancy editing effects, which can be erratic at times and stylish in others. With the iffy special effects, the film sometimes comes off as appearing rather gaudy. Still, the actors do their best: Michael Jai White brings the Spawn character to life with just the right amount of emotional punch and machismo, while Martin Sheen, John Leguizamo, and Nicol Williamson all put on very hammy performances (for better or for worse). Despite the gaudy CGI, this production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes. Music is really awesome. I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of "Spawn" first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)

    (Note: This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.) 1997's New Line Cinema release "Spawn" is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy. Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light. Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic "Necro-flesh" body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans. The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called "The Violator"). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character. The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background. My major problems with this film fall into several big points. First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and "movie-like" during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time. Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give "Spawn" an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

    The only reason I'm not giving this waste of celluloid a single point is because it is not the worst comic book adaptation. I think that goes got Captain America. Not Joe Johnston's, but Albert Pyun's in 1990. Anyway, this crap is what happens when you get someone like Dippe who came in off Jurassic Park and T2... For CGI. Needless to say, Sheen was seemingly hired to have an A-list name attached. Jai White is at his worst with his best Shatner impersonation, he comes off as surprised he even got the role and it appears that he was picked because he wasn't asking much for a salary. Actually, with his portrayal, he should have done a respectable thing and returned some of it. The "movie" depends too heavily on the outdated CGI and the production design than the actors and story. Then there's Leguizamo who seems so insecure that Dippe told him he was "doing good. Keep that momentum. I see Oscars!" And Leguizamo seems so gullible to believe he was actually stealing the show. There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy.

    In "Spawn," a pedestrian fantasy thriller, Todd McFarlane's ghoulish menagerie of apocalyptic characters wage the perennial battle of good versus evil. Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping "Spawn" as the next generation super-hero beyond "Batman & Robin." Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as "Spawn" is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions. Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc&eacute;e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of "Beverly Hills Cop 3"). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of "The Pest") forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon. Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of "Excalibur") competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in "Spawn" long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in "Spawn" has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's "Batman." Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of "Darkman" and "The Crow." Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him. If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the "Spawn" characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one. The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, "Spawn" amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of "Spawn" may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

    Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Nicol Williamson, Melinda Clarke and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd McFarlane's comic book. This focuses on government mercenary/assassin, Al Simmons (White) who wants to spend the rest of his life with fianc&eacute;e, Wanda (Randle). After a mission goes unexpectedly, Al tells his corrupt boss, Jason Wynn (Sheen) he wants out, but Wynn asks him to do one last mission in North Korea. Wynn sets him up and has him killed by his right-hand assassin, Priest (Clarke). Al discovers he's been chosen to be hell's ultimate weapon and guided by a demonic clown (Leguizamo). After 5 years, Al returns home badly burned learning that Wanda is married to his best friend, Terry (Sweeney) and have a daughter. Williamson (Return to Oz) plays Cogliostro, a mysterious old man who tries to help Al do good and overcome his hatred and revenge. This isn't great, but not bad and the cast is good in it. I like how some of the characters are named after McFarlane's real-life friends and still recommend this, especially if you're a comic book fan.

    While CG has had an immeasurable effect on movies, it is some debate whether it has been for good or for ill. Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot "Sin City" in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if "Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones" had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly. Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well? "Spawn" is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of "Playing Villains For Dummies" handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read "Faust") while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects. I actually wanted to like "Spawn" but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), "Spawn" might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action "Guyver: Dark Hero" movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then "Spawn" might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based "The Matrix". Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

    I didn't get how this movie wasn't that good well i know why. It was the crappy affect of the monsters. When the clown changed i did not like it cgf. I also did not like the thing that told spawn to lead an army it looked more like a monster in sheep clothing than a big fire demon. Though there were some good parts like the part were spawn fought clown and fought the evil guy. Although the clown was really goofy for a villain the joker is way better than him he would when both killjoy and that clown in a clowning around battle. Killjoy has his own movie too it is not worth renting. I also liked the part were the clown farted and putted stains in his underwear. my brother doe's that it is strange. My rating overall is 6 out of 10 it is worth a c+

    Spawn is an odd film indeed. Taken from a lesser known comic book character this film seemed to come out of nowhere in the late 90's and for all it's worth it does exactly what it say on the tin. Comic book films weren't as widespread as they are now. With the obvious Superman/Batman franchises there wan't much going around that was true comic book material. It's certainly not a great film. The acting s pretty below par (but never truly terrible). Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere. The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are. The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes? As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

    Before I review this, I just want to ask has anybody actually read Spawn? And if so, did you like it? When I mention Spawn to people, they go "Huh?" They never even heard of it. It was a movie not many people saw, based on a comic book not many people read. Good points: Has a good idea. An man gets sent to Hell because he's an assassin and will lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend again. The Alley scenes look cool, the soundtrack's lethal and John Leguizamo's great as Clown. Not to mention him and Michael Jai White had to sit 3 hours in the make up chairs and the prosthetics were a nightmare to wear. Bad points: The acting is terrible. Michael Jai White is great as Al Simmons, but as Spawn, he's too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible. At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers. But is it enjoyable? I thought it was okay. If want to see a good comic book adaptation, then rent a Marvel film out.

    If you've seen the animated series or you've read the comics you know what I mean. Where to start... First of all the cheesiness is just too much to bare and Michael Jai White is awful as spawn and Martin sheen is really bad too,Hell looks awful and the plot is rushed, not very well thought out and not explained very well leaving the viewer confused especially if they haven't read the comics or watched the animated series So why did I gave it 5*? Well I think 3 things saved this from garbage. 1. Clown is awesome in this movie whenever I see this character I forget how bad the film is. 2. The special effects in some off these scenes are really awesome such as when spawn comes crashing through the roof, spawns chains and spawns spikes however the effects of malebolgia and hell are really bad 3. The action scenes are really enjoyable and fun to watch. I really feel if they made a much more serious, longer and better thought out film this movie could have been incredible and I think if this film gets a reboot with the right team it could be a 9 or 10* movie. I highly recommend watching the animated serious over this.

    I remember back in the late 90s, "Spawn" was one of those films that just looked really cool, in the same vein as "Blade" or "The Matrix" (or maybe it's because they all had similar-looking DVD releases). Films like these capitalized greatly on then-impressive special effects, slick cinematic style, frequent action, a dark and Gothic subject matter, and really awesome soundtracks. As cool as "Spawn" seems, however, it's nowhere near as cool as these other films. The coolness of "Spawn" is that it has a lot of action. It doesn't really drag all that much. It has a cool concept behind its antihero character and the overall story; one that offers potential for some epic special effects and some interesting plot twists. And, it has one of the coolest soundtracks on the market. The lameness of "Spawn" is that the dialogue is often very corny, the villains are standard megalomaniacs, the special effects are horrid (even by 1997 standards), a few parts are way too cartoony for its own good (especially regarding the clown character), the style of editing can be pretty erratic and weird, and the film overall is watered down for a PG-13 rating (even the R-rated cut doesn't really push the boundaries much). The thing I find most disconcerting is the execution of the story. The original story for "Spawn" is a pretty dark and compelling drama, on a level similar to "The Crow." It was handled with just the perfect level of respect and quality with the HBO animation. This film takes the material, keeps the core story, but skims over a huge amount of the plot in a short runtime. As such, parts of it are rushed and choppy. Regardless, it does handle a few aspects appropriately. It is inherently compelling to watch the main character suffering betrayal and loss, before being forced to choose between vengeance and morality. It is a story with promise; it's just told in a goofy way. For what it's worth, the photography is not bad. The film is edited with some really weird and fancy editing effects, which can be erratic at times and stylish in others. With the iffy special effects, the film sometimes comes off as appearing rather gaudy. Still, the actors do their best: Michael Jai White brings the Spawn character to life with just the right amount of emotional punch and machismo, while Martin Sheen, John Leguizamo, and Nicol Williamson all put on very hammy performances (for better or for worse). Despite the gaudy CGI, this production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes. Music is really awesome. I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of "Spawn" first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)

    (Note: This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.) 1997's New Line Cinema release "Spawn" is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy. Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light. Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic "Necro-flesh" body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans. The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called "The Violator"). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character. The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background. My major problems with this film fall into several big points. First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and "movie-like" during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time. Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give "Spawn" an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

    The only reason I'm not giving this waste of celluloid a single point is because it is not the worst comic book adaptation. I think that goes got Captain America. Not Joe Johnston's, but Albert Pyun's in 1990. Anyway, this crap is what happens when you get someone like Dippe who came in off Jurassic Park and T2... For CGI. Needless to say, Sheen was seemingly hired to have an A-list name attached. Jai White is at his worst with his best Shatner impersonation, he comes off as surprised he even got the role and it appears that he was picked because he wasn't asking much for a salary. Actually, with his portrayal, he should have done a respectable thing and returned some of it. The "movie" depends too heavily on the outdated CGI and the production design than the actors and story. Then there's Leguizamo who seems so insecure that Dippe told him he was "doing good. Keep that momentum. I see Oscars!" And Leguizamo seems so gullible to believe he was actually stealing the show. There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy.

    In "Spawn," a pedestrian fantasy thriller, Todd McFarlane's ghoulish menagerie of apocalyptic characters wage the perennial battle of good versus evil. Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping "Spawn" as the next generation super-hero beyond "Batman & Robin." Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as "Spawn" is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions. Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc&eacute;e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of "Beverly Hills Cop 3"). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of "The Pest") forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon. Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of "Excalibur") competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in "Spawn" long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in "Spawn" has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's "Batman." Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of "Darkman" and "The Crow." Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him. If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the "Spawn" characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one. The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, "Spawn" amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of "Spawn" may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

    Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Nicol Williamson, Melinda Clarke and Martin Sheen star in this 1997 action film based on Todd McFarlane's comic book. This focuses on government mercenary/assassin, Al Simmons (White) who wants to spend the rest of his life with fianc&eacute;e, Wanda (Randle). After a mission goes unexpectedly, Al tells his corrupt boss, Jason Wynn (Sheen) he wants out, but Wynn asks him to do one last mission in North Korea. Wynn sets him up and has him killed by his right-hand assassin, Priest (Clarke). Al discovers he's been chosen to be hell's ultimate weapon and guided by a demonic clown (Leguizamo). After 5 years, Al returns home badly burned learning that Wanda is married to his best friend, Terry (Sweeney) and have a daughter. Williamson (Return to Oz) plays Cogliostro, a mysterious old man who tries to help Al do good and overcome his hatred and revenge. This isn't great, but not bad and the cast is good in it. I like how some of the characters are named after McFarlane's real-life friends and still recommend this, especially if you're a comic book fan.

    While CG has had an immeasurable effect on movies, it is some debate whether it has been for good or for ill. Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot "Sin City" in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if "Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones" had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly. Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well? "Spawn" is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of "Playing Villains For Dummies" handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read "Faust") while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects. I actually wanted to like "Spawn" but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), "Spawn" might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action "Guyver: Dark Hero" movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then "Spawn" might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based "The Matrix". Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

I also did not like the thing that told spawn to lead an army it looked more like a monster in sheep clothing than a big fire demon. Though there were some good parts like the part were spawn fought clown and fought the evil guy. Although the clown was really goofy for a villain the joker is way better than him he would when both killjoy and that clown in a clowning around battle. Killjoy has his own movie too it is not worth renting. I also liked the part were the clown farted and putted stains in his underwear. my brother doe's that it is strange. My rating overall is 6 out of 10 it is worth a c+

    Spawn is an odd film indeed. Taken from a lesser known comic book character this film seemed to come out of nowhere in the late 90's and for all it's worth it does exactly what it say on the tin. Comic book films weren't as widespread as they are now. With the obvious Superman/Batman franchises there wan't much going around that was true comic book material. It's certainly not a great film. The acting s pretty below par (but never truly terrible). Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere. The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are. The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes? As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

    Before I review this, I just want to ask has anybody actually read Spawn? And if so, did you like it? When I mention Spawn to people, they go "Huh?" They never even heard of it. It was a movie not many people saw, based on a comic book not many people read. Good points: Has a good idea. An man gets sent to Hell because he's an assassin and will lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend again. The Alley scenes look cool, the soundtrack's lethal and John Leguizamo's great as Clown. Not to mention him and Michael Jai White had to sit 3 hours in the make up chairs and the prosthetics were a nightmare to wear. Bad points: The acting is terrible. Michael Jai White is great as Al Simmons, but as Spawn, he's too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible. At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers. But is it enjoyable? I thought it was okay. If want to see a good comic book adaptation, then rent a Marvel film out.

    If you've seen the animated series or you've read the comics you know what I mean. Where to start... First of all the cheesiness is just too much to bare and Michael Jai White is awful as spawn and Martin sheen is really bad too,Hell looks awful and the plot is rushed, not very well thought out and not explained very well leaving the viewer confused especially if they haven't read the comics or watched the animated series So why did I gave it 5*? Well I think 3 things saved this from garbage. 1. Clown is awesome in this movie whenever I see this character I forget how bad the film is. 2. The special effects in some off these scenes are really awesome such as when spawn comes crashing through the roof, spawns chains and spawns spikes however the effects of malebolgia and hell are really bad 3. The action scenes are really enjoyable and fun to watch. I really feel if they made a much more serious, longer and better thought out film this movie could have been incredible and I think if this film gets a reboot with the right team it could be a 9 or 10* movie. I highly recommend watching the animated serious over this.

    I remember back in the late 90s, "Spawn" was one of those films that just looked really cool, in the same vein as "Blade" or "The Matrix" (or maybe it's because they all had similar-looking DVD releases). Films like these capitalized greatly on then-impressive special effects, slick cinematic style, frequent action, a dark and Gothic subject matter, and really awesome soundtracks. As cool as "Spawn" seems, however, it's nowhere near as cool as these other films. The coolness of "Spawn" is that it has a lot of action. It doesn't really drag all that much. It has a cool concept behind its antihero character and the overall story; one that offers potential for some epic special effects and some interesting plot twists. And, it has one of the coolest soundtracks on the market. The lameness of "Spawn" is that the dialogue is often very corny, the villains are standard megalomaniacs, the special effects are horrid (even by 1997 standards), a few parts are way too cartoony for its own good (especially regarding the clown character), the style of editing can be pretty erratic and weird, and the film overall is watered down for a PG-13 rating (even the R-rated cut doesn't really push the boundaries much). The thing I find most disconcerting is the execution of the story. The original story for "Spawn" is a pretty dark and compelling drama, on a level similar to "The Crow." It was handled with just the perfect level of respect and quality with the HBO animation. This film takes the material, keeps the core story, but skims over a huge amount of the plot in a short runtime. As such, parts of it are rushed and choppy. Regardless, it does handle a few aspects appropriately. It is inherently compelling to watch the main character suffering betrayal and loss, before being forced to choose between vengeance and morality. It is a story with promise; it's just told in a goofy way. For what it's worth, the photography is not bad. The film is edited with some really weird and fancy editing effects, which can be erratic at times and stylish in others. With the iffy special effects, the film sometimes comes off as appearing rather gaudy. Still, the actors do their best: Michael Jai White brings the Spawn character to life with just the right amount of emotional punch and machismo, while Martin Sheen, John Leguizamo, and Nicol Williamson all put on very hammy performances (for better or for worse). Despite the gaudy CGI, this production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes. Music is really awesome. I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of "Spawn" first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds. 3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)

    "Spawn" is a fun (but deeply flawed) little comic book film from yester-year... Doesn't hold a candle to the comic or cartoon...

    (Note: This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.) 1997's New Line Cinema release "Spawn" is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy. Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light. Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic "Necro-flesh" body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans. The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called "The Violator"). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character. The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background. My major problems with this film fall into several big points. First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and "movie-like" during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time. Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give "Spawn" an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

    The only reason I'm not giving this waste of celluloid a single point is because it is not the worst comic book adaptation. I think that goes got Captain America. Not Joe Johnston's, but Albert Pyun's in 1990. Anyway, this crap is what happens when you get someone like Dippe who came in off Jurassic Park and T2... For CGI. Needless to say, Sheen was seemingly hired to have an A-list name attached. Jai White is at his worst with his best Shatner impersonation, he comes off as surprised he even got the role and it appears that he was picked because he wasn't asking much for a salary. Actually, with his portrayal, he should have done a respectable thing and returned some of it. The "movie" depends too heavily on the outdated CGI and the production design than the actors and story. Then there's Leguizamo who seems so insecure that Dippe told him he was "doing good. Keep that momentum. I see Oscars!" And Leguizamo seems so gullible to believe he was actually stealing the show. There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy.
