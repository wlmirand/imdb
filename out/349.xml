    In rain-drenched Huntingburg, Indiana, "Armored Transport" guard Christian Slater (as Tom) loads over $3 million dollars in his truck. While trying to transport the money out of town during a particularly wicked storm, Mr. Slater's truck gets stuck in rising rain waters. This makes the money an easy target for crooked Morgan Freeman (as Jim) and his gang; they move to rob the truck, but Slater escapes with the cash. Slater stashes the money and is picked up by sheriff Randy Quaid (as Mike) and his deputies. Everyone wants the money, but the entire town is flooding fast... "Hard Rain" is presented by the successful "Speed" driven (1994) team of Mark Gordon and Graham Yost, and it features even more of the same non-stop high energy. Mikael Salomon makes the action look good. Characterization is secondary. You don't care about the leading men (and woman) - although, there must be some points given to Slater trying to escape from a jail cell while flood waters rise, and love interest Minnie Driver (as Karen) suffering through an attempted rape by "Penthouse" forum reader Mark Rolston (as Wayne) while she is handcuffed to a banister... Otherwise, the only thing noteworthy about the bigger cast names is their various levels of profanity. As you might expect, Betty White (as Doreen) comes out swinging, but Mr. Quaid finishes strong. Unfortunately, Ms. White and Edward "Ed" Asner (as Charlie) share no scenes; it would have been nice to see the two "Mary Tyler Moore" alumni together. More impressive are the lesser-known players, like trigger-happy Michael Goorjian (as Kenny) and distinctly featured Peter Murnik (as Phil). Action is more exciting when accompanied by strong characterization. ***** Hard Rain (1/16/98) Mikael Salomon ~ Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver, Randy Quaid

    Finally caught this film on cable and thoroughly enjoyed it. A rain drenched town flooded to the gills with Christian Slater as an armored truck guard protecting three million from a band of outlaws. This is a suburban Poseidon Adventure with many superb set pieces that continuously entertains and includes some great moments of suspense. Watching bandits blaze through high school corridors on Jet Skis in pursuit of Slater was a great highlight. In an age before CGI dominated every film it is refreshing to see practical - not animated effects with actual water flooding the roads, homes, alleys and buildings of a small Indiana town. Slater and Minnie Driver have a nice chemistry and Morgan Freeman always strong turns in a top notch performance. Some nice cameo appearance from Betty White and Richard Dysart liven up the action and add a few chuckles along the way. There are few adventure films today that provide the same escapist entertainment as Hard Rain. Put this one in your queue, it's solid entertainment where action and suspense reign hard.

    Sometimes a movie will appear that nobody has heard anything about; there is no hype nor is there any expectations. Even moreso, these movies will be brilliant, as is Hard Rain. I first heard about this movie on an add the day it opened in the cinema and thought "this might be good." I went and saw it and said, "This is brilliant". Hard Rain is an action movie. It could be a disaster movie with a plot, but it is not. The disaster has already happened. A huge torrent of rain has descended upon a town and has flooded it out and everybody has evacuated. The banks need their money moved to dry ground, so an armoured car comes and picks it up. With three million dollars in the back of this car, somebody is going to want it. That is were Jim (Morgan Freeman) and his gang of thieves come into the movie. They plan to steal the money, but the driver Tom (Christian Slater) manages to get away with it and hide it. Thus a chase across a flooded town where the waters are slowly rising begins. But it is not simply just that because the plot begins to twist, but I won't say anything about it. They say that movies which involve lots of water, such as Titanic and Waterworld, cost a lot of money to make. They also say that rain is very expensive. This movie floods out an entire town, to a point where the statue in the town square is completely inundated, and it rains continuously. The only scenes were it is not raining is when people are inside. This movie is definitely big budget, but it is well worth the price of a cinema ticket. Another thing a friend said. Most Hollywood movies you know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are within the first few minutes. Some movies, like Terminator II, you are not meant to know, but you do anyway. One of the major themes with the movie is that people are not who they seem and first impressions are not always the ones you count on. Everybody in this movie has a part of them that we do not expect. It is not an unrealistic change, but rather a change that comes over people when the opportunity appears. Three Million Dollars is a lot of money, and only the most honest person will not part with it. It is also how the relationships between the characters change. Karen (Minnie Driver) first takes Tom to be a looter who broke into her church to steal money, but what she doesn't know is that he is being chased by crooks. Jim is a crook and Tom takes him to be a killer. He believes that it was Jim that killed his uncle and that Jim would kill him to as soon as he found the money. The other characters are interesting as well, with the hotheaded young crook who acts on instinct. Jim expects this heist to go off perfect, but the youth, with is quick thinking and itchy trigger finger, creates a big problem. The Negro is also an interesting character for he quotes bible verses that relate to floods. This is not to say that he is a Christian, but rather that he has a mystical aura about him. Karen has also changed, though not on screen. She left town a girl and returned a woman. She used to be wild at heart, according to the deputy, and has now returned a woman too good for anybody else.

    As a movie with water, lots and lots and water, it's actually not that bad. But as a typical action picture, it's got villains that aren't mean enough, and don't seem quite determined enough (to get what they want, that is) for this movie to be something truly exciting. It's nice to see Morgan Freeman playing a bad guy, but he smiles a couple times (and I'm not talking about evil smiles), which is kind of a cheat. Give the characters a little more personality, ratchet the suspense a little, speed up the action, and this could have been a top-notch movie. And aside from comic relief, the two elderly characters (one of them played by Betty White), are unnecessary. *** out of ****

    Hard Rain comes at us like a rigid and thoroughly uneven, although enjoyable in that way things that are less than perfect sometimes are, soft-back pulp novel; a heist story with a twist and its own unique selling point; in this case, the fact that it will rain just as much as throughout the piece it has done the last week leading up to these events, which in turn will lead to rising water levels no doubt destined to prove a problem to those within. The film's catalyst is the robbing of an armoured van, a heist movie idea which, chances are, isn't anything we haven't seen before, and yet we smile at the places the film takes us; enjoy the application of this idea that the water levels are rising at a gross rate and have fun with this hybridisation of the varying disaster movie conventions which rear up with crime movie archetypes. Swedish director Mikael Salomon is having fun, and we're having fun with him; he seems to spend most of the film channelling a kind of mock-Western genre aesthetic to the overall film. Such a thing begins with the opening shot, a heck of an opening shot in truth during which a long tracking shot begins in the sky and floats across the more rural parts of the town before arriving in the centre within which we observe people being evacuated. Flying down to ground level, we note the harmonica music and the boarded up windows belonging to varying businesses in what is a launching of the film's Western tendencies. It is perhaps true to say the film's ambition does not match this opening. The film comes to unfold within a locale very much cut off from the rest of the world; under the characters' feet, water replaces sand and dirt but a small isolated town eventually succumbs to corruption and two people whom are initially at odds must pool resources to survive. One character, the instigator of the heist played by Morgan Freeman, waltzes throughout the film donning a stetson, whereas the hapless lead, a victim of this van robbery played by Christian Slater, even finds time to bury the treasures numerous parties are gunning for in a graveyard evoking Leone's The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. We begin with the Sheriff of the town directing traffic away from the town; he is Randy Quaid's Mike Collins, and works with a number of deputies. After an establishment of some of his more pleasant; more helping characteristics, the temperature of his presence on screen briefly changes when the town's mayor drives by and off, and Collins briefly reveals a franker nature when he expresses his disdain for the man. Not so far away is Slater's character, a young armoured van guard named Tom standing in a bank lugging large bags of money with an accomplice in a faceless and anonymous fashion. It is revealed they are not robbing, but removing; so as to transport the cash away from the soon to be water-logged town to safety. The initial establishment of these people as folk to be wary of precedes a revealing of their more genuine nature, in that they are upstanding and present on justified terms; something that encapsulates this idea of transition later becoming more prominent and standing in equal measure to that of Collins and his deputies, whose natures began as helping and unassuming before taking a nastier turn. Tom reiterates that there is little adventure in his life, although he would like there to be, while his partner in security points out that when he was Tom's age, he too suffered from a great lack of 'happening' in his life. This alludes to an apparent lack of life experience, and aids in increasing tension as later events play out  events of which we doubt Tom will be able to rise to. Then there is Freeman's character, Jim - an ageing man seemingly too embittered to even raise his voice; a man whom forms a posse with three others, each epitomising varying clich&eacute;s in that the glasses wearing nerd; the wise-cracking, bible-quoting African American and the hot-headed kid make up his troup&eacute;. They plan to hit the truck, the cash being Jim's "retirement fund" in the fleeting few hours he'll probably get to spend it out of dropping dead with hypothermia. When he stands in a sparsely populated bar early on, he deals with a situation involving one of his gang and their exuberance with a crossword puzzle in a newspaper, in what is an instance of the man dealing with a scenario in a calm; creative and intuitional manner which should bode well for certain later exchanges. The bulk of the film consists of surprisingly engrossing chase as well as neatly unfolded allegiances which come to differ throughout; Salomon's film a series of really rather well constructed set pieces involving causality, rescue and evasion which come together and work much more than they have any right to. The director, a man whose work I had not come across in any other capacity prior to first seeing this guilty pleasure several years ago, nor indeed have I experience any since, keeps things chugging along without trying to dress it up as anything it isn't. Hard Rain is a film difficult not to get into, and tough to really dislike.

    Hard Rain is an action adventure thriller movie. The main thrust of the plot concerns the efforts of security guard Tom (Christian Slater) to prevent assorted hoodlums from stealing the money he and his partner are transporting. The unusual element of this movie is that it takes place during a deluge which has resulted in extensive flooding, so most of the action takes place in and around a town which is almost underwater. Considering that the main appeal of the movie is the water-based locations, action and stunts, the film-makers have done quite a good job in providing a plot with a number of twists, and characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs. OK, so not much more, admittedly, but there is still an element of depth to them (the water in town is deeper)(sorry). But the semi-aquatic realm in which the movie is set is flawlessly realised. The main track through town (along which boats race), and the water-filled interiors of the school, the jail, a church, and assorted houses - all are absolutely convincing, as is the action which takes place in them. This is a very enjoyable movie with a most unusual premise.

    It's an armoured-car heist. And apparently, the villains not only knew when it was going to set off, how much was in it, and which way it was going; they also knew what the weather would be like en-route. Now that's forward planning! The old geezer driving it is apparently the villains' inside man. He drives the truck into a road flood, stalling the engine. Now all the gang have to do is turn-up in a boat and help themselves. Starring Pixie-faced Christian Slater as the honest sidekick; he puts up a fight which results in the old guy being gunned-down. After that, he hides the money and runs. The villains give chase. They need him alive in order to know where he's hidden it. Cue all manner of water sports. The rain is incessant (though not heavy enough to put out a simple church-roof fire). Flooding worsens. The dam breaks. Minnie (donkey jaws) Driver appears as a restorer of stained-glass windows, giving her usual acting-by-numbers turn. The sheriff goes crooked at the thought of $3 million, so enmity and loyalty become ambiguous though offer few additional thrills. Shooting gets almost incessant, mostly to little effect. In the end; it's boring. For me, the biggest problem is that non of the characters move me to care for them. The old guy, who might have excited sympathy, was one of the gang. Slater's and Driver's characters both incline towards the unbelievable. The rest are mostly just cameos of one particular human trait or another. The most heavyweight and potentially likable character is that of Morgan Freeman. But he is the lead baddie. And while he may not have wanted anyone hurt, it nevertheless happens and on his watch. If you don't care about the characters, then you don't care what happens to them, so there's no story to speak of. It's basically a thick slice of robbery ham, to which floods of water do not bring the additional drama its makers had hoped. One-watch hokum, can't recommend it. Incidentally; by 1998, armoured cars in Britain contained 'a locked safe to which the crew had no access', a homing device that was tamper-proof, explosive dye-bags that would render money un-useable, and 'smart-water' contaminants. Apparently the Yanks need to modernise. Mind how you go.

    I discovered this movie because there is Minnie Driver in it and i must say that this is a great one! Except "War of worlds" by Spielberg, i don't know a movie with such an apocalyptic setting: Mother Nature is set loose and threatens to flood everything. But instead of focusing with megalopolises (NY, LA) and calling for the President, this realistic movie happens in a little town of Indiana. Thus, it is closes to our every day life and we can better understand the threat. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but there is a Gothic feeling here that enhances everything. It's the night, the town is surrounded by forest, and a lot of action happens on the cemetery and the church. And if it's an action / thriller movie, actually, some shoots reminds me of the best horror movies. Then, i found all the characters very attractive: you either care for them or despise them at once. And, they aren't one-sided characters because along the movie, their polarity changes: good guys become bad, and bad guys become good. Thus, it is very interesting to see that and the cast does have mention because they make that happen. As a fan of Minnie, i found that she has truly something because she is 100% believable in this action / comedy part whereas other actress would have failed. I never heard of the director before but he knows how to deliver great sequences: the opening credits give the mood for the entire movie and you will find all the threats from flooding. In conclusion, this upside down "Abyss" is an excellent tale and if you can find it, dive in it !

    Tom (Christian Slater), is a guard-jury that leads with his partner a van armored transport of money. Approximately giant floods in the city by the have to go through and it is evacuated. Tom and his partner they will be guarding three million dollars pursued by criminals. It is an exciting film of action that gives no respite, hectic from beginning to end, with excellent scenes full of vertigo and extreme tension. Action is pure, to entertain and pass the time. The look from the gender, the film plays very well with the goal. In this genre what more is to be assessed are the sensations, and this is an objective widely exceeded. The atmosphere anguish of a people under the threat of flooding by the breaking of a dam. coupled with a plan to steal a van armored, is a situation in which you can take advantage easily. Mikael Salomon in this movie get his work. Film it wanted take advantage of the strain that had once again the disaster movie in the mid 1990, this time, with the disastrous panorama that cause a flood, although its authors carried the story more by the gender police. One of the changes that occurred in the film was the title, because they went through several, the most considered "The Flood" in reference to the catastrophe in question, but changed in the last time by "Hard Rain", title more police. The script is the strong point, no lapses at any time, and is appreciated that is not so predictable. It is easy to follow, entertaining and fluid, without such drastic changes so disconcerting and occasionally credible. Good visual effects in the parties that truly movie needed. A ambiance and mounting distinguished. We really immersed in the scenario that we proposed Mikael Solomon. The performances are very good. Randy Quaid "Independence Day" with magnificent performance as corrupt police and greedy, Morgan Freeman always sober and blunt .Christian Slater confirms that he's more than a simple actor from " Der Name der Rose " with Sean Connery). The rest of the cast is makes a performance acceptable.

    Hard Rain is something different than your average disaster movie. It takes place in a small town in Indiana. Where remaining survivors are scavenging to save what they have left before the flood. And when two "armor truck guard" buddies are in center of a plot to heist the armor truck for 3 million dollars. All heck becomes a desperate plan to survive for Hale(Christian Slater) when a crew of hired arms lead by Jim(Morgan Freeman) who have mistakenly sidetracked their plan and have to chase him through the flood of the entire town... Lots of action, thrills, and some surprisingly amazing acting from Randy Quaid as the sheriff. Along with cast as Mini Driver, Christian Slater, Ed Asner, and of course Morgan Freeman.. One of my top favorites and a enjoyable movie..

    Hard Rain comes at us like a rigid and thoroughly uneven, although enjoyable in that way things that are less than perfect sometimes are, soft-back pulp novel; a heist story with a twist and its own unique selling point; in this case, the fact that it will rain just as much as throughout the piece it has done the last week leading up to these events, which in turn will lead to rising water levels no doubt destined to prove a problem to those within. The film's catalyst is the robbing of an armoured van, a heist movie idea which, chances are, isn't anything we haven't seen before, and yet we smile at the places the film takes us; enjoy the application of this idea that the water levels are rising at a gross rate and have fun with this hybridisation of the varying disaster movie conventions which rear up with crime movie archetypes. Swedish director Mikael Salomon is having fun, and we're having fun with him; he seems to spend most of the film channelling a kind of mock-Western genre aesthetic to the overall film. Such a thing begins with the opening shot, a heck of an opening shot in truth during which a long tracking shot begins in the sky and floats across the more rural parts of the town before arriving in the centre within which we observe people being evacuated. Flying down to ground level, we note the harmonica music and the boarded up windows belonging to varying businesses in what is a launching of the film's Western tendencies. It is perhaps true to say the film's ambition does not match this opening. The film comes to unfold within a locale very much cut off from the rest of the world; under the characters' feet, water replaces sand and dirt but a small isolated town eventually succumbs to corruption and two people whom are initially at odds must pool resources to survive. One character, the instigator of the heist played by Morgan Freeman, waltzes throughout the film donning a stetson, whereas the hapless lead, a victim of this van robbery played by Christian Slater, even finds time to bury the treasures numerous parties are gunning for in a graveyard evoking Leone's The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. We begin with the Sheriff of the town directing traffic away from the town; he is Randy Quaid's Mike Collins, and works with a number of deputies. After an establishment of some of his more pleasant; more helping characteristics, the temperature of his presence on screen briefly changes when the town's mayor drives by and off, and Collins briefly reveals a franker nature when he expresses his disdain for the man. Not so far away is Slater's character, a young armoured van guard named Tom standing in a bank lugging large bags of money with an accomplice in a faceless and anonymous fashion. It is revealed they are not robbing, but removing; so as to transport the cash away from the soon to be water-logged town to safety. The initial establishment of these people as folk to be wary of precedes a revealing of their more genuine nature, in that they are upstanding and present on justified terms; something that encapsulates this idea of transition later becoming more prominent and standing in equal measure to that of Collins and his deputies, whose natures began as helping and unassuming before taking a nastier turn. Tom reiterates that there is little adventure in his life, although he would like there to be, while his partner in security points out that when he was Tom's age, he too suffered from a great lack of 'happening' in his life. This alludes to an apparent lack of life experience, and aids in increasing tension as later events play out  events of which we doubt Tom will be able to rise to. Then there is Freeman's character, Jim - an ageing man seemingly too embittered to even raise his voice; a man whom forms a posse with three others, each epitomising varying clich&eacute;s in that the glasses wearing nerd; the wise-cracking, bible-quoting African American and the hot-headed kid make up his troup&eacute;. They plan to hit the truck, the cash being Jim's "retirement fund" in the fleeting few hours he'll probably get to spend it out of dropping dead with hypothermia. When he stands in a sparsely populated bar early on, he deals with a situation involving one of his gang and their exuberance with a crossword puzzle in a newspaper, in what is an instance of the man dealing with a scenario in a calm; creative and intuitional manner which should bode well for certain later exchanges. The bulk of the film consists of surprisingly engrossing chase as well as neatly unfolded allegiances which come to differ throughout; Salomon's film a series of really rather well constructed set pieces involving causality, rescue and evasion which come together and work much more than they have any right to. The director, a man whose work I had not come across in any other capacity prior to first seeing this guilty pleasure several years ago, nor indeed have I experience any since, keeps things chugging along without trying to dress it up as anything it isn't. Hard Rain is a film difficult not to get into, and tough to really dislike.

    Hard Rain is an action adventure thriller movie. The main thrust of the plot concerns the efforts of security guard Tom (Christian Slater) to prevent assorted hoodlums from stealing the money he and his partner are transporting. The unusual element of this movie is that it takes place during a deluge which has resulted in extensive flooding, so most of the action takes place in and around a town which is almost underwater. Considering that the main appeal of the movie is the water-based locations, action and stunts, the film-makers have done quite a good job in providing a plot with a number of twists, and characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs. OK, so not much more, admittedly, but there is still an element of depth to them (the water in town is deeper)(sorry). But the semi-aquatic realm in which the movie is set is flawlessly realised. The main track through town (along which boats race), and the water-filled interiors of the school, the jail, a church, and assorted houses - all are absolutely convincing, as is the action which takes place in them. This is a very enjoyable movie with a most unusual premise.

    It's an armoured-car heist. And apparently, the villains not only knew when it was going to set off, how much was in it, and which way it was going; they also knew what the weather would be like en-route. Now that's forward planning! The old geezer driving it is apparently the villains' inside man. He drives the truck into a road flood, stalling the engine. Now all the gang have to do is turn-up in a boat and help themselves. Starring Pixie-faced Christian Slater as the honest sidekick; he puts up a fight which results in the old guy being gunned-down. After that, he hides the money and runs. The villains give chase. They need him alive in order to know where he's hidden it. Cue all manner of water sports. The rain is incessant (though not heavy enough to put out a simple church-roof fire). Flooding worsens. The dam breaks. Minnie (donkey jaws) Driver appears as a restorer of stained-glass windows, giving her usual acting-by-numbers turn. The sheriff goes crooked at the thought of $3 million, so enmity and loyalty become ambiguous though offer few additional thrills. Shooting gets almost incessant, mostly to little effect. In the end; it's boring. For me, the biggest problem is that non of the characters move me to care for them. The old guy, who might have excited sympathy, was one of the gang. Slater's and Driver's characters both incline towards the unbelievable. The rest are mostly just cameos of one particular human trait or another. The most heavyweight and potentially likable character is that of Morgan Freeman. But he is the lead baddie. And while he may not have wanted anyone hurt, it nevertheless happens and on his watch. If you don't care about the characters, then you don't care what happens to them, so there's no story to speak of. It's basically a thick slice of robbery ham, to which floods of water do not bring the additional drama its makers had hoped. One-watch hokum, can't recommend it. Incidentally; by 1998, armoured cars in Britain contained 'a locked safe to which the crew had no access', a homing device that was tamper-proof, explosive dye-bags that would render money un-useable, and 'smart-water' contaminants. Apparently the Yanks need to modernise. Mind how you go.

    I discovered this movie because there is Minnie Driver in it and i must say that this is a great one! Except "War of worlds" by Spielberg, i don't know a movie with such an apocalyptic setting: Mother Nature is set loose and threatens to flood everything. But instead of focusing with megalopolises (NY, LA) and calling for the President, this realistic movie happens in a little town of Indiana. Thus, it is closes to our every day life and we can better understand the threat. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but there is a Gothic feeling here that enhances everything. It's the night, the town is surrounded by forest, and a lot of action happens on the cemetery and the church. And if it's an action / thriller movie, actually, some shoots reminds me of the best horror movies. Then, i found all the characters very attractive: you either care for them or despise them at once. And, they aren't one-sided characters because along the movie, their polarity changes: good guys become bad, and bad guys become good. Thus, it is very interesting to see that and the cast does have mention because they make that happen. As a fan of Minnie, i found that she has truly something because she is 100% believable in this action / comedy part whereas other actress would have failed. I never heard of the director before but he knows how to deliver great sequences: the opening credits give the mood for the entire movie and you will find all the threats from flooding. In conclusion, this upside down "Abyss" is an excellent tale and if you can find it, dive in it !

    Tom (Christian Slater), is a guard-jury that leads with his partner a van armored transport of money. Approximately giant floods in the city by the have to go through and it is evacuated. Tom and his partner they will be guarding three million dollars pursued by criminals. It is an exciting film of action that gives no respite, hectic from beginning to end, with excellent scenes full of vertigo and extreme tension. Action is pure, to entertain and pass the time. The look from the gender, the film plays very well with the goal. In this genre what more is to be assessed are the sensations, and this is an objective widely exceeded. The atmosphere anguish of a people under the threat of flooding by the breaking of a dam. coupled with a plan to steal a van armored, is a situation in which you can take advantage easily. Mikael Salomon in this movie get his work. Film it wanted take advantage of the strain that had once again the disaster movie in the mid 1990, this time, with the disastrous panorama that cause a flood, although its authors carried the story more by the gender police. One of the changes that occurred in the film was the title, because they went through several, the most considered "The Flood" in reference to the catastrophe in question, but changed in the last time by "Hard Rain", title more police. The script is the strong point, no lapses at any time, and is appreciated that is not so predictable. It is easy to follow, entertaining and fluid, without such drastic changes so disconcerting and occasionally credible. Good visual effects in the parties that truly movie needed. A ambiance and mounting distinguished. We really immersed in the scenario that we proposed Mikael Solomon. The performances are very good. Randy Quaid "Independence Day" with magnificent performance as corrupt police and greedy, Morgan Freeman always sober and blunt .Christian Slater confirms that he's more than a simple actor from " Der Name der Rose " with Sean Connery). The rest of the cast is makes a performance acceptable.

    Hard Rain is something different than your average disaster movie. It takes place in a small town in Indiana. Where remaining survivors are scavenging to save what they have left before the flood. And when two "armor truck guard" buddies are in center of a plot to heist the armor truck for 3 million dollars. All heck becomes a desperate plan to survive for Hale(Christian Slater) when a crew of hired arms lead by Jim(Morgan Freeman) who have mistakenly sidetracked their plan and have to chase him through the flood of the entire town... Lots of action, thrills, and some surprisingly amazing acting from Randy Quaid as the sheriff. Along with cast as Mini Driver, Christian Slater, Ed Asner, and of course Morgan Freeman.. One of my top favorites and a enjoyable movie..

    In rain-drenched Huntingburg, Indiana, "Armored Transport" guard Christian Slater (as Tom) loads over $3 million dollars in his truck. While trying to transport the money out of town during a particularly wicked storm, Mr. Slater's truck gets stuck in rising rain waters. This makes the money an easy target for crooked Morgan Freeman (as Jim) and his gang; they move to rob the truck, but Slater escapes with the cash. Slater stashes the money and is picked up by sheriff Randy Quaid (as Mike) and his deputies. Everyone wants the money, but the entire town is flooding fast... "Hard Rain" is presented by the successful "Speed" driven (1994) team of Mark Gordon and Graham Yost, and it features even more of the same non-stop high energy. Mikael Salomon makes the action look good. Characterization is secondary. You don't care about the leading men (and woman) - although, there must be some points given to Slater trying to escape from a jail cell while flood waters rise, and love interest Minnie Driver (as Karen) suffering through an attempted rape by "Penthouse" forum reader Mark Rolston (as Wayne) while she is handcuffed to a banister... Otherwise, the only thing noteworthy about the bigger cast names is their various levels of profanity. As you might expect, Betty White (as Doreen) comes out swinging, but Mr. Quaid finishes strong. Unfortunately, Ms. White and Edward "Ed" Asner (as Charlie) share no scenes; it would have been nice to see the two "Mary Tyler Moore" alumni together. More impressive are the lesser-known players, like trigger-happy Michael Goorjian (as Kenny) and distinctly featured Peter Murnik (as Phil). Action is more exciting when accompanied by strong characterization. ***** Hard Rain (1/16/98) Mikael Salomon ~ Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver, Randy Quaid

    Finally caught this film on cable and thoroughly enjoyed it. A rain drenched town flooded to the gills with Christian Slater as an armored truck guard protecting three million from a band of outlaws. This is a suburban Poseidon Adventure with many superb set pieces that continuously entertains and includes some great moments of suspense. Watching bandits blaze through high school corridors on Jet Skis in pursuit of Slater was a great highlight. In an age before CGI dominated every film it is refreshing to see practical - not animated effects with actual water flooding the roads, homes, alleys and buildings of a small Indiana town. Slater and Minnie Driver have a nice chemistry and Morgan Freeman always strong turns in a top notch performance. Some nice cameo appearance from Betty White and Richard Dysart liven up the action and add a few chuckles along the way. There are few adventure films today that provide the same escapist entertainment as Hard Rain. Put this one in your queue, it's solid entertainment where action and suspense reign hard.

    Sometimes a movie will appear that nobody has heard anything about; there is no hype nor is there any expectations. Even moreso, these movies will be brilliant, as is Hard Rain. I first heard about this movie on an add the day it opened in the cinema and thought "this might be good." I went and saw it and said, "This is brilliant". Hard Rain is an action movie. It could be a disaster movie with a plot, but it is not. The disaster has already happened. A huge torrent of rain has descended upon a town and has flooded it out and everybody has evacuated. The banks need their money moved to dry ground, so an armoured car comes and picks it up. With three million dollars in the back of this car, somebody is going to want it. That is were Jim (Morgan Freeman) and his gang of thieves come into the movie. They plan to steal the money, but the driver Tom (Christian Slater) manages to get away with it and hide it. Thus a chase across a flooded town where the waters are slowly rising begins. But it is not simply just that because the plot begins to twist, but I won't say anything about it. They say that movies which involve lots of water, such as Titanic and Waterworld, cost a lot of money to make. They also say that rain is very expensive. This movie floods out an entire town, to a point where the statue in the town square is completely inundated, and it rains continuously. The only scenes were it is not raining is when people are inside. This movie is definitely big budget, but it is well worth the price of a cinema ticket. Another thing a friend said. Most Hollywood movies you know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are within the first few minutes. Some movies, like Terminator II, you are not meant to know, but you do anyway. One of the major themes with the movie is that people are not who they seem and first impressions are not always the ones you count on. Everybody in this movie has a part of them that we do not expect. It is not an unrealistic change, but rather a change that comes over people when the opportunity appears. Three Million Dollars is a lot of money, and only the most honest person will not part with it. It is also how the relationships between the characters change. Karen (Minnie Driver) first takes Tom to be a looter who broke into her church to steal money, but what she doesn't know is that he is being chased by crooks. Jim is a crook and Tom takes him to be a killer. He believes that it was Jim that killed his uncle and that Jim would kill him to as soon as he found the money. The other characters are interesting as well, with the hotheaded young crook who acts on instinct. Jim expects this heist to go off perfect, but the youth, with is quick thinking and itchy trigger finger, creates a big problem. The Negro is also an interesting character for he quotes bible verses that relate to floods. This is not to say that he is a Christian, but rather that he has a mystical aura about him. Karen has also changed, though not on screen. She left town a girl and returned a woman. She used to be wild at heart, according to the deputy, and has now returned a woman too good for anybody else.

    As a movie with water, lots and lots and water, it's actually not that bad. But as a typical action picture, it's got villains that aren't mean enough, and don't seem quite determined enough (to get what they want, that is) for this movie to be something truly exciting. It's nice to see Morgan Freeman playing a bad guy, but he smiles a couple times (and I'm not talking about evil smiles), which is kind of a cheat. Give the characters a little more personality, ratchet the suspense a little, speed up the action, and this could have been a top-notch movie. And aside from comic relief, the two elderly characters (one of them played by Betty White), are unnecessary. *** out of ****

    Tom (Christian Slater), is a guard-jury that leads with his partner a van armored transport of money. Approximately giant floods in the city by the have to go through and it is evacuated. Tom and his partner they will be guarding three million dollars pursued by criminals. It is an exciting film of action that gives no respite, hectic from beginning to end, with excellent scenes full of vertigo and extreme tension. Action is pure, to entertain and pass the time. The look from the gender, the film plays very well with the goal. In this genre what more is to be assessed are the sensations, and this is an objective widely exceeded. The atmosphere anguish of a people under the threat of flooding by the breaking of a dam. coupled with a plan to steal a van armored, is a situation in which you can take advantage easily. Mikael Salomon in this movie get his work. Film it wanted take advantage of the strain that had once again the disaster movie in the mid 1990, this time, with the disastrous panorama that cause a flood, although its authors carried the story more by the gender police. One of the changes that occurred in the film was the title, because they went through several, the most considered "The Flood" in reference to the catastrophe in question, but changed in the last time by "Hard Rain", title more police. The script is the strong point, no lapses at any time, and is appreciated that is not so predictable. It is easy to follow, entertaining and fluid, without such drastic changes so disconcerting and occasionally credible. Good visual effects in the parties that truly movie needed. A ambiance and mounting distinguished. We really immersed in the scenario that we proposed Mikael Solomon. The performances are very good. Randy Quaid "Independence Day" with magnificent performance as corrupt police and greedy, Morgan Freeman always sober and blunt .Christian Slater confirms that he's more than a simple actor from " Der Name der Rose " with Sean Connery). The rest of the cast is makes a performance acceptable.

    Hard Rain is something different than your average disaster movie. It takes place in a small town in Indiana. Where remaining survivors are scavenging to save what they have left before the flood. And when two "armor truck guard" buddies are in center of a plot to heist the armor truck for 3 million dollars. All heck becomes a desperate plan to survive for Hale(Christian Slater) when a crew of hired arms lead by Jim(Morgan Freeman) who have mistakenly sidetracked their plan and have to chase him through the flood of the entire town... Lots of action, thrills, and some surprisingly amazing acting from Randy Quaid as the sheriff. Along with cast as Mini Driver, Christian Slater, Ed Asner, and of course Morgan Freeman.. One of my top favorites and a enjoyable movie..

    In rain-drenched Huntingburg, Indiana, "Armored Transport" guard Christian Slater (as Tom) loads over $3 million dollars in his truck. While trying to transport the money out of town during a particularly wicked storm, Mr. Slater's truck gets stuck in rising rain waters. This makes the money an easy target for crooked Morgan Freeman (as Jim) and his gang; they move to rob the truck, but Slater escapes with the cash. Slater stashes the money and is picked up by sheriff Randy Quaid (as Mike) and his deputies. Everyone wants the money, but the entire town is flooding fast... "Hard Rain" is presented by the successful "Speed" driven (1994) team of Mark Gordon and Graham Yost, and it features even more of the same non-stop high energy. Mikael Salomon makes the action look good. Characterization is secondary. You don't care about the leading men (and woman) - although, there must be some points given to Slater trying to escape from a jail cell while flood waters rise, and love interest Minnie Driver (as Karen) suffering through an attempted rape by "Penthouse" forum reader Mark Rolston (as Wayne) while she is handcuffed to a banister... Otherwise, the only thing noteworthy about the bigger cast names is their various levels of profanity. As you might expect, Betty White (as Doreen) comes out swinging, but Mr. Quaid finishes strong. Unfortunately, Ms. White and Edward "Ed" Asner (as Charlie) share no scenes; it would have been nice to see the two "Mary Tyler Moore" alumni together. More impressive are the lesser-known players, like trigger-happy Michael Goorjian (as Kenny) and distinctly featured Peter Murnik (as Phil). Action is more exciting when accompanied by strong characterization. ***** Hard Rain (1/16/98) Mikael Salomon ~ Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver, Randy Quaid

    Finally caught this film on cable and thoroughly enjoyed it. A rain drenched town flooded to the gills with Christian Slater as an armored truck guard protecting three million from a band of outlaws. This is a suburban Poseidon Adventure with many superb set pieces that continuously entertains and includes some great moments of suspense. Watching bandits blaze through high school corridors on Jet Skis in pursuit of Slater was a great highlight. In an age before CGI dominated every film it is refreshing to see practical - not animated effects with actual water flooding the roads, homes, alleys and buildings of a small Indiana town. Slater and Minnie Driver have a nice chemistry and Morgan Freeman always strong turns in a top notch performance. Some nice cameo appearance from Betty White and Richard Dysart liven up the action and add a few chuckles along the way. There are few adventure films today that provide the same escapist entertainment as Hard Rain. Put this one in your queue, it's solid entertainment where action and suspense reign hard.

    Sometimes a movie will appear that nobody has heard anything about; there is no hype nor is there any expectations. Even moreso, these movies will be brilliant, as is Hard Rain. I first heard about this movie on an add the day it opened in the cinema and thought "this might be good." I went and saw it and said, "This is brilliant". Hard Rain is an action movie. It could be a disaster movie with a plot, but it is not. The disaster has already happened. A huge torrent of rain has descended upon a town and has flooded it out and everybody has evacuated. The banks need their money moved to dry ground, so an armoured car comes and picks it up. With three million dollars in the back of this car, somebody is going to want it. That is were Jim (Morgan Freeman) and his gang of thieves come into the movie. They plan to steal the money, but the driver Tom (Christian Slater) manages to get away with it and hide it. Thus a chase across a flooded town where the waters are slowly rising begins. But it is not simply just that because the plot begins to twist, but I won't say anything about it. They say that movies which involve lots of water, such as Titanic and Waterworld, cost a lot of money to make. They also say that rain is very expensive. This movie floods out an entire town, to a point where the statue in the town square is completely inundated, and it rains continuously. The only scenes were it is not raining is when people are inside. This movie is definitely big budget, but it is well worth the price of a cinema ticket. Another thing a friend said. Most Hollywood movies you know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are within the first few minutes. Some movies, like Terminator II, you are not meant to know, but you do anyway. One of the major themes with the movie is that people are not who they seem and first impressions are not always the ones you count on. Everybody in this movie has a part of them that we do not expect. It is not an unrealistic change, but rather a change that comes over people when the opportunity appears. Three Million Dollars is a lot of money, and only the most honest person will not part with it. It is also how the relationships between the characters change. Karen (Minnie Driver) first takes Tom to be a looter who broke into her church to steal money, but what she doesn't know is that he is being chased by crooks. Jim is a crook and Tom takes him to be a killer. He believes that it was Jim that killed his uncle and that Jim would kill him to as soon as he found the money. The other characters are interesting as well, with the hotheaded young crook who acts on instinct. Jim expects this heist to go off perfect, but the youth, with is quick thinking and itchy trigger finger, creates a big problem. The Negro is also an interesting character for he quotes bible verses that relate to floods. This is not to say that he is a Christian, but rather that he has a mystical aura about him. Karen has also changed, though not on screen. She left town a girl and returned a woman. She used to be wild at heart, according to the deputy, and has now returned a woman too good for anybody else.

    As a movie with water, lots and lots and water, it's actually not that bad. But as a typical action picture, it's got villains that aren't mean enough, and don't seem quite determined enough (to get what they want, that is) for this movie to be something truly exciting. It's nice to see Morgan Freeman playing a bad guy, but he smiles a couple times (and I'm not talking about evil smiles), which is kind of a cheat. Give the characters a little more personality, ratchet the suspense a little, speed up the action, and this could have been a top-notch movie. And aside from comic relief, the two elderly characters (one of them played by Betty White), are unnecessary. *** out of ****

    Hard Rain comes at us like a rigid and thoroughly uneven, although enjoyable in that way things that are less than perfect sometimes are, soft-back pulp novel; a heist story with a twist and its own unique selling point; in this case, the fact that it will rain just as much as throughout the piece it has done the last week leading up to these events, which in turn will lead to rising water levels no doubt destined to prove a problem to those within. The film's catalyst is the robbing of an armoured van, a heist movie idea which, chances are, isn't anything we haven't seen before, and yet we smile at the places the film takes us; enjoy the application of this idea that the water levels are rising at a gross rate and have fun with this hybridisation of the varying disaster movie conventions which rear up with crime movie archetypes. Swedish director Mikael Salomon is having fun, and we're having fun with him; he seems to spend most of the film channelling a kind of mock-Western genre aesthetic to the overall film. Such a thing begins with the opening shot, a heck of an opening shot in truth during which a long tracking shot begins in the sky and floats across the more rural parts of the town before arriving in the centre within which we observe people being evacuated. Flying down to ground level, we note the harmonica music and the boarded up windows belonging to varying businesses in what is a launching of the film's Western tendencies. It is perhaps true to say the film's ambition does not match this opening. The film comes to unfold within a locale very much cut off from the rest of the world; under the characters' feet, water replaces sand and dirt but a small isolated town eventually succumbs to corruption and two people whom are initially at odds must pool resources to survive. One character, the instigator of the heist played by Morgan Freeman, waltzes throughout the film donning a stetson, whereas the hapless lead, a victim of this van robbery played by Christian Slater, even finds time to bury the treasures numerous parties are gunning for in a graveyard evoking Leone's The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. We begin with the Sheriff of the town directing traffic away from the town; he is Randy Quaid's Mike Collins, and works with a number of deputies. After an establishment of some of his more pleasant; more helping characteristics, the temperature of his presence on screen briefly changes when the town's mayor drives by and off, and Collins briefly reveals a franker nature when he expresses his disdain for the man. Not so far away is Slater's character, a young armoured van guard named Tom standing in a bank lugging large bags of money with an accomplice in a faceless and anonymous fashion. It is revealed they are not robbing, but removing; so as to transport the cash away from the soon to be water-logged town to safety. The initial establishment of these people as folk to be wary of precedes a revealing of their more genuine nature, in that they are upstanding and present on justified terms; something that encapsulates this idea of transition later becoming more prominent and standing in equal measure to that of Collins and his deputies, whose natures began as helping and unassuming before taking a nastier turn. Tom reiterates that there is little adventure in his life, although he would like there to be, while his partner in security points out that when he was Tom's age, he too suffered from a great lack of 'happening' in his life. This alludes to an apparent lack of life experience, and aids in increasing tension as later events play out  events of which we doubt Tom will be able to rise to. Then there is Freeman's character, Jim - an ageing man seemingly too embittered to even raise his voice; a man whom forms a posse with three others, each epitomising varying clich&eacute;s in that the glasses wearing nerd; the wise-cracking, bible-quoting African American and the hot-headed kid make up his troup&eacute;. They plan to hit the truck, the cash being Jim's "retirement fund" in the fleeting few hours he'll probably get to spend it out of dropping dead with hypothermia. When he stands in a sparsely populated bar early on, he deals with a situation involving one of his gang and their exuberance with a crossword puzzle in a newspaper, in what is an instance of the man dealing with a scenario in a calm; creative and intuitional manner which should bode well for certain later exchanges. The bulk of the film consists of surprisingly engrossing chase as well as neatly unfolded allegiances which come to differ throughout; Salomon's film a series of really rather well constructed set pieces involving causality, rescue and evasion which come together and work much more than they have any right to. The director, a man whose work I had not come across in any other capacity prior to first seeing this guilty pleasure several years ago, nor indeed have I experience any since, keeps things chugging along without trying to dress it up as anything it isn't. Hard Rain is a film difficult not to get into, and tough to really dislike.

    Hard Rain is an action adventure thriller movie. The main thrust of the plot concerns the efforts of security guard Tom (Christian Slater) to prevent assorted hoodlums from stealing the money he and his partner are transporting. The unusual element of this movie is that it takes place during a deluge which has resulted in extensive flooding, so most of the action takes place in and around a town which is almost underwater. Considering that the main appeal of the movie is the water-based locations, action and stunts, the film-makers have done quite a good job in providing a plot with a number of twists, and characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs. OK, so not much more, admittedly, but there is still an element of depth to them (the water in town is deeper)(sorry). But the semi-aquatic realm in which the movie is set is flawlessly realised. The main track through town (along which boats race), and the water-filled interiors of the school, the jail, a church, and assorted houses - all are absolutely convincing, as is the action which takes place in them. This is a very enjoyable movie with a most unusual premise.

    It's an armoured-car heist. And apparently, the villains not only knew when it was going to set off, how much was in it, and which way it was going; they also knew what the weather would be like en-route. Now that's forward planning! The old geezer driving it is apparently the villains' inside man. He drives the truck into a road flood, stalling the engine. Now all the gang have to do is turn-up in a boat and help themselves. Starring Pixie-faced Christian Slater as the honest sidekick; he puts up a fight which results in the old guy being gunned-down. After that, he hides the money and runs. The villains give chase. They need him alive in order to know where he's hidden it. Cue all manner of water sports. The rain is incessant (though not heavy enough to put out a simple church-roof fire). Flooding worsens. The dam breaks. Minnie (donkey jaws) Driver appears as a restorer of stained-glass windows, giving her usual acting-by-numbers turn. The sheriff goes crooked at the thought of $3 million, so enmity and loyalty become ambiguous though offer few additional thrills. Shooting gets almost incessant, mostly to little effect. In the end; it's boring. For me, the biggest problem is that non of the characters move me to care for them. The old guy, who might have excited sympathy, was one of the gang. Slater's and Driver's characters both incline towards the unbelievable. The rest are mostly just cameos of one particular human trait or another. The most heavyweight and potentially likable character is that of Morgan Freeman. But he is the lead baddie. And while he may not have wanted anyone hurt, it nevertheless happens and on his watch. If you don't care about the characters, then you don't care what happens to them, so there's no story to speak of. It's basically a thick slice of robbery ham, to which floods of water do not bring the additional drama its makers had hoped. One-watch hokum, can't recommend it. Incidentally; by 1998, armoured cars in Britain contained 'a locked safe to which the crew had no access', a homing device that was tamper-proof, explosive dye-bags that would render money un-useable, and 'smart-water' contaminants. Apparently the Yanks need to modernise. Mind how you go.

    I discovered this movie because there is Minnie Driver in it and i must say that this is a great one! Except "War of worlds" by Spielberg, i don't know a movie with such an apocalyptic setting: Mother Nature is set loose and threatens to flood everything. But instead of focusing with megalopolises (NY, LA) and calling for the President, this realistic movie happens in a little town of Indiana. Thus, it is closes to our every day life and we can better understand the threat. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but there is a Gothic feeling here that enhances everything. It's the night, the town is surrounded by forest, and a lot of action happens on the cemetery and the church. And if it's an action / thriller movie, actually, some shoots reminds me of the best horror movies. Then, i found all the characters very attractive: you either care for them or despise them at once. And, they aren't one-sided characters because along the movie, their polarity changes: good guys become bad, and bad guys become good. Thus, it is very interesting to see that and the cast does have mention because they make that happen. As a fan of Minnie, i found that she has truly something because she is 100% believable in this action / comedy part whereas other actress would have failed. I never heard of the director before but he knows how to deliver great sequences: the opening credits give the mood for the entire movie and you will find all the threats from flooding. In conclusion, this upside down "Abyss" is an excellent tale and if you can find it, dive in it !

Give the characters a little more personality, ratchet the suspense a little, speed up the action, and this could have been a top-notch movie. And aside from comic relief, the two elderly characters (one of them played by Betty White), are unnecessary. *** out of ****

    Hard Rain comes at us like a rigid and thoroughly uneven, although enjoyable in that way things that are less than perfect sometimes are, soft-back pulp novel; a heist story with a twist and its own unique selling point; in this case, the fact that it will rain just as much as throughout the piece it has done the last week leading up to these events, which in turn will lead to rising water levels no doubt destined to prove a problem to those within. The film's catalyst is the robbing of an armoured van, a heist movie idea which, chances are, isn't anything we haven't seen before, and yet we smile at the places the film takes us; enjoy the application of this idea that the water levels are rising at a gross rate and have fun with this hybridisation of the varying disaster movie conventions which rear up with crime movie archetypes. Swedish director Mikael Salomon is having fun, and we're having fun with him; he seems to spend most of the film channelling a kind of mock-Western genre aesthetic to the overall film. Such a thing begins with the opening shot, a heck of an opening shot in truth during which a long tracking shot begins in the sky and floats across the more rural parts of the town before arriving in the centre within which we observe people being evacuated. Flying down to ground level, we note the harmonica music and the boarded up windows belonging to varying businesses in what is a launching of the film's Western tendencies. It is perhaps true to say the film's ambition does not match this opening. The film comes to unfold within a locale very much cut off from the rest of the world; under the characters' feet, water replaces sand and dirt but a small isolated town eventually succumbs to corruption and two people whom are initially at odds must pool resources to survive. One character, the instigator of the heist played by Morgan Freeman, waltzes throughout the film donning a stetson, whereas the hapless lead, a victim of this van robbery played by Christian Slater, even finds time to bury the treasures numerous parties are gunning for in a graveyard evoking Leone's The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. We begin with the Sheriff of the town directing traffic away from the town; he is Randy Quaid's Mike Collins, and works with a number of deputies. After an establishment of some of his more pleasant; more helping characteristics, the temperature of his presence on screen briefly changes when the town's mayor drives by and off, and Collins briefly reveals a franker nature when he expresses his disdain for the man. Not so far away is Slater's character, a young armoured van guard named Tom standing in a bank lugging large bags of money with an accomplice in a faceless and anonymous fashion. It is revealed they are not robbing, but removing; so as to transport the cash away from the soon to be water-logged town to safety. The initial establishment of these people as folk to be wary of precedes a revealing of their more genuine nature, in that they are upstanding and present on justified terms; something that encapsulates this idea of transition later becoming more prominent and standing in equal measure to that of Collins and his deputies, whose natures began as helping and unassuming before taking a nastier turn. Tom reiterates that there is little adventure in his life, although he would like there to be, while his partner in security points out that when he was Tom's age, he too suffered from a great lack of 'happening' in his life. This alludes to an apparent lack of life experience, and aids in increasing tension as later events play out  events of which we doubt Tom will be able to rise to. Then there is Freeman's character, Jim - an ageing man seemingly too embittered to even raise his voice; a man whom forms a posse with three others, each epitomising varying clich&eacute;s in that the glasses wearing nerd; the wise-cracking, bible-quoting African American and the hot-headed kid make up his troup&eacute;. They plan to hit the truck, the cash being Jim's "retirement fund" in the fleeting few hours he'll probably get to spend it out of dropping dead with hypothermia. When he stands in a sparsely populated bar early on, he deals with a situation involving one of his gang and their exuberance with a crossword puzzle in a newspaper, in what is an instance of the man dealing with a scenario in a calm; creative and intuitional manner which should bode well for certain later exchanges. The bulk of the film consists of surprisingly engrossing chase as well as neatly unfolded allegiances which come to differ throughout; Salomon's film a series of really rather well constructed set pieces involving causality, rescue and evasion which come together and work much more than they have any right to. The director, a man whose work I had not come across in any other capacity prior to first seeing this guilty pleasure several years ago, nor indeed have I experience any since, keeps things chugging along without trying to dress it up as anything it isn't. Hard Rain is a film difficult not to get into, and tough to really dislike.

    Hard Rain is an action adventure thriller movie. The main thrust of the plot concerns the efforts of security guard Tom (Christian Slater) to prevent assorted hoodlums from stealing the money he and his partner are transporting. The unusual element of this movie is that it takes place during a deluge which has resulted in extensive flooding, so most of the action takes place in and around a town which is almost underwater. Considering that the main appeal of the movie is the water-based locations, action and stunts, the film-makers have done quite a good job in providing a plot with a number of twists, and characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs. OK, so not much more, admittedly, but there is still an element of depth to them (the water in town is deeper)(sorry). But the semi-aquatic realm in which the movie is set is flawlessly realised. The main track through town (along which boats race), and the water-filled interiors of the school, the jail, a church, and assorted houses - all are absolutely convincing, as is the action which takes place in them. This is a very enjoyable movie with a most unusual premise.

    It's an armoured-car heist. And apparently, the villains not only knew when it was going to set off, how much was in it, and which way it was going; they also knew what the weather would be like en-route. Now that's forward planning! The old geezer driving it is apparently the villains' inside man. He drives the truck into a road flood, stalling the engine. Now all the gang have to do is turn-up in a boat and help themselves. Starring Pixie-faced Christian Slater as the honest sidekick; he puts up a fight which results in the old guy being gunned-down. After that, he hides the money and runs. The villains give chase. They need him alive in order to know where he's hidden it. Cue all manner of water sports. The rain is incessant (though not heavy enough to put out a simple church-roof fire). Flooding worsens. The dam breaks. Minnie (donkey jaws) Driver appears as a restorer of stained-glass windows, giving her usual acting-by-numbers turn. The sheriff goes crooked at the thought of $3 million, so enmity and loyalty become ambiguous though offer few additional thrills. Shooting gets almost incessant, mostly to little effect. In the end; it's boring. For me, the biggest problem is that non of the characters move me to care for them. The old guy, who might have excited sympathy, was one of the gang. Slater's and Driver's characters both incline towards the unbelievable. The rest are mostly just cameos of one particular human trait or another. The most heavyweight and potentially likable character is that of Morgan Freeman. But he is the lead baddie. And while he may not have wanted anyone hurt, it nevertheless happens and on his watch. If you don't care about the characters, then you don't care what happens to them, so there's no story to speak of. It's basically a thick slice of robbery ham, to which floods of water do not bring the additional drama its makers had hoped. One-watch hokum, can't recommend it. Incidentally; by 1998, armoured cars in Britain contained 'a locked safe to which the crew had no access', a homing device that was tamper-proof, explosive dye-bags that would render money un-useable, and 'smart-water' contaminants. Apparently the Yanks need to modernise. Mind how you go.

    I discovered this movie because there is Minnie Driver in it and i must say that this is a great one! Except "War of worlds" by Spielberg, i don't know a movie with such an apocalyptic setting: Mother Nature is set loose and threatens to flood everything. But instead of focusing with megalopolises (NY, LA) and calling for the President, this realistic movie happens in a little town of Indiana. Thus, it is closes to our every day life and we can better understand the threat. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but there is a Gothic feeling here that enhances everything. It's the night, the town is surrounded by forest, and a lot of action happens on the cemetery and the church. And if it's an action / thriller movie, actually, some shoots reminds me of the best horror movies. Then, i found all the characters very attractive: you either care for them or despise them at once. And, they aren't one-sided characters because along the movie, their polarity changes: good guys become bad, and bad guys become good. Thus, it is very interesting to see that and the cast does have mention because they make that happen. As a fan of Minnie, i found that she has truly something because she is 100% believable in this action / comedy part whereas other actress would have failed. I never heard of the director before but he knows how to deliver great sequences: the opening credits give the mood for the entire movie and you will find all the threats from flooding. In conclusion, this upside down "Abyss" is an excellent tale and if you can find it, dive in it !

    Tom (Christian Slater), is a guard-jury that leads with his partner a van armored transport of money. Approximately giant floods in the city by the have to go through and it is evacuated. Tom and his partner they will be guarding three million dollars pursued by criminals. It is an exciting film of action that gives no respite, hectic from beginning to end, with excellent scenes full of vertigo and extreme tension. Action is pure, to entertain and pass the time. The look from the gender, the film plays very well with the goal. In this genre what more is to be assessed are the sensations, and this is an objective widely exceeded. The atmosphere anguish of a people under the threat of flooding by the breaking of a dam. coupled with a plan to steal a van armored, is a situation in which you can take advantage easily. Mikael Salomon in this movie get his work. Film it wanted take advantage of the strain that had once again the disaster movie in the mid 1990, this time, with the disastrous panorama that cause a flood, although its authors carried the story more by the gender police. One of the changes that occurred in the film was the title, because they went through several, the most considered "The Flood" in reference to the catastrophe in question, but changed in the last time by "Hard Rain", title more police. The script is the strong point, no lapses at any time, and is appreciated that is not so predictable. It is easy to follow, entertaining and fluid, without such drastic changes so disconcerting and occasionally credible. Good visual effects in the parties that truly movie needed. A ambiance and mounting distinguished. We really immersed in the scenario that we proposed Mikael Solomon. The performances are very good. Randy Quaid "Independence Day" with magnificent performance as corrupt police and greedy, Morgan Freeman always sober and blunt .Christian Slater confirms that he's more than a simple actor from " Der Name der Rose " with Sean Connery). The rest of the cast is makes a performance acceptable.

    Hard Rain is something different than your average disaster movie. It takes place in a small town in Indiana. Where remaining survivors are scavenging to save what they have left before the flood. And when two "armor truck guard" buddies are in center of a plot to heist the armor truck for 3 million dollars. All heck becomes a desperate plan to survive for Hale(Christian Slater) when a crew of hired arms lead by Jim(Morgan Freeman) who have mistakenly sidetracked their plan and have to chase him through the flood of the entire town... Lots of action, thrills, and some surprisingly amazing acting from Randy Quaid as the sheriff. Along with cast as Mini Driver, Christian Slater, Ed Asner, and of course Morgan Freeman.. One of my top favorites and a enjoyable movie..

    In rain-drenched Huntingburg, Indiana, "Armored Transport" guard Christian Slater (as Tom) loads over $3 million dollars in his truck. While trying to transport the money out of town during a particularly wicked storm, Mr. Slater's truck gets stuck in rising rain waters. This makes the money an easy target for crooked Morgan Freeman (as Jim) and his gang; they move to rob the truck, but Slater escapes with the cash. Slater stashes the money and is picked up by sheriff Randy Quaid (as Mike) and his deputies. Everyone wants the money, but the entire town is flooding fast... "Hard Rain" is presented by the successful "Speed" driven (1994) team of Mark Gordon and Graham Yost, and it features even more of the same non-stop high energy. Mikael Salomon makes the action look good. Characterization is secondary. You don't care about the leading men (and woman) - although, there must be some points given to Slater trying to escape from a jail cell while flood waters rise, and love interest Minnie Driver (as Karen) suffering through an attempted rape by "Penthouse" forum reader Mark Rolston (as Wayne) while she is handcuffed to a banister... Otherwise, the only thing noteworthy about the bigger cast names is their various levels of profanity. As you might expect, Betty White (as Doreen) comes out swinging, but Mr. Quaid finishes strong. Unfortunately, Ms. White and Edward "Ed" Asner (as Charlie) share no scenes; it would have been nice to see the two "Mary Tyler Moore" alumni together. More impressive are the lesser-known players, like trigger-happy Michael Goorjian (as Kenny) and distinctly featured Peter Murnik (as Phil). Action is more exciting when accompanied by strong characterization. ***** Hard Rain (1/16/98) Mikael Salomon ~ Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver, Randy Quaid

    Finally caught this film on cable and thoroughly enjoyed it. A rain drenched town flooded to the gills with Christian Slater as an armored truck guard protecting three million from a band of outlaws. This is a suburban Poseidon Adventure with many superb set pieces that continuously entertains and includes some great moments of suspense. Watching bandits blaze through high school corridors on Jet Skis in pursuit of Slater was a great highlight. In an age before CGI dominated every film it is refreshing to see practical - not animated effects with actual water flooding the roads, homes, alleys and buildings of a small Indiana town. Slater and Minnie Driver have a nice chemistry and Morgan Freeman always strong turns in a top notch performance. Some nice cameo appearance from Betty White and Richard Dysart liven up the action and add a few chuckles along the way. There are few adventure films today that provide the same escapist entertainment as Hard Rain. Put this one in your queue, it's solid entertainment where action and suspense reign hard.

    Sometimes a movie will appear that nobody has heard anything about; there is no hype nor is there any expectations. Even moreso, these movies will be brilliant, as is Hard Rain. I first heard about this movie on an add the day it opened in the cinema and thought "this might be good." I went and saw it and said, "This is brilliant". Hard Rain is an action movie. It could be a disaster movie with a plot, but it is not. The disaster has already happened. A huge torrent of rain has descended upon a town and has flooded it out and everybody has evacuated. The banks need their money moved to dry ground, so an armoured car comes and picks it up. With three million dollars in the back of this car, somebody is going to want it. That is were Jim (Morgan Freeman) and his gang of thieves come into the movie. They plan to steal the money, but the driver Tom (Christian Slater) manages to get away with it and hide it. Thus a chase across a flooded town where the waters are slowly rising begins. But it is not simply just that because the plot begins to twist, but I won't say anything about it. They say that movies which involve lots of water, such as Titanic and Waterworld, cost a lot of money to make. They also say that rain is very expensive. This movie floods out an entire town, to a point where the statue in the town square is completely inundated, and it rains continuously. The only scenes were it is not raining is when people are inside. This movie is definitely big budget, but it is well worth the price of a cinema ticket. Another thing a friend said. Most Hollywood movies you know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are within the first few minutes. Some movies, like Terminator II, you are not meant to know, but you do anyway. One of the major themes with the movie is that people are not who they seem and first impressions are not always the ones you count on. Everybody in this movie has a part of them that we do not expect. It is not an unrealistic change, but rather a change that comes over people when the opportunity appears. Three Million Dollars is a lot of money, and only the most honest person will not part with it. It is also how the relationships between the characters change. Karen (Minnie Driver) first takes Tom to be a looter who broke into her church to steal money, but what she doesn't know is that he is being chased by crooks. Jim is a crook and Tom takes him to be a killer. He believes that it was Jim that killed his uncle and that Jim would kill him to as soon as he found the money. The other characters are interesting as well, with the hotheaded young crook who acts on instinct. Jim expects this heist to go off perfect, but the youth, with is quick thinking and itchy trigger finger, creates a big problem. The Negro is also an interesting character for he quotes bible verses that relate to floods. This is not to say that he is a Christian, but rather that he has a mystical aura about him. Karen has also changed, though not on screen. She left town a girl and returned a woman. She used to be wild at heart, according to the deputy, and has now returned a woman too good for anybody else.

And if it's an action / thriller movie, actually, some shoots reminds me of the best horror movies. Then, i found all the characters very attractive: you either care for them or despise them at once. And, they aren't one-sided characters because along the movie, their polarity changes: good guys become bad, and bad guys become good. Thus, it is very interesting to see that and the cast does have mention because they make that happen. As a fan of Minnie, i found that she has truly something because she is 100% believable in this action / comedy part whereas other actress would have failed. I never heard of the director before but he knows how to deliver great sequences: the opening credits give the mood for the entire movie and you will find all the threats from flooding. In conclusion, this upside down "Abyss" is an excellent tale and if you can find it, dive in it !

    Tom (Christian Slater), is a guard-jury that leads with his partner a van armored transport of money. Approximately giant floods in the city by the have to go through and it is evacuated. Tom and his partner they will be guarding three million dollars pursued by criminals. It is an exciting film of action that gives no respite, hectic from beginning to end, with excellent scenes full of vertigo and extreme tension. Action is pure, to entertain and pass the time. The look from the gender, the film plays very well with the goal. In this genre what more is to be assessed are the sensations, and this is an objective widely exceeded. The atmosphere anguish of a people under the threat of flooding by the breaking of a dam. coupled with a plan to steal a van armored, is a situation in which you can take advantage easily. Mikael Salomon in this movie get his work. Film it wanted take advantage of the strain that had once again the disaster movie in the mid 1990, this time, with the disastrous panorama that cause a flood, although its authors carried the story more by the gender police. One of the changes that occurred in the film was the title, because they went through several, the most considered "The Flood" in reference to the catastrophe in question, but changed in the last time by "Hard Rain", title more police. The script is the strong point, no lapses at any time, and is appreciated that is not so predictable. It is easy to follow, entertaining and fluid, without such drastic changes so disconcerting and occasionally credible. Good visual effects in the parties that truly movie needed. A ambiance and mounting distinguished. We really immersed in the scenario that we proposed Mikael Solomon. The performances are very good. Randy Quaid "Independence Day" with magnificent performance as corrupt police and greedy, Morgan Freeman always sober and blunt .Christian Slater confirms that he's more than a simple actor from " Der Name der Rose " with Sean Connery). The rest of the cast is makes a performance acceptable.

    Hard Rain is something different than your average disaster movie. It takes place in a small town in Indiana. Where remaining survivors are scavenging to save what they have left before the flood. And when two "armor truck guard" buddies are in center of a plot to heist the armor truck for 3 million dollars. All heck becomes a desperate plan to survive for Hale(Christian Slater) when a crew of hired arms lead by Jim(Morgan Freeman) who have mistakenly sidetracked their plan and have to chase him through the flood of the entire town... Lots of action, thrills, and some surprisingly amazing acting from Randy Quaid as the sheriff. Along with cast as Mini Driver, Christian Slater, Ed Asner, and of course Morgan Freeman.. One of my top favorites and a enjoyable movie..

    In rain-drenched Huntingburg, Indiana, "Armored Transport" guard Christian Slater (as Tom) loads over $3 million dollars in his truck. While trying to transport the money out of town during a particularly wicked storm, Mr. Slater's truck gets stuck in rising rain waters. This makes the money an easy target for crooked Morgan Freeman (as Jim) and his gang; they move to rob the truck, but Slater escapes with the cash. Slater stashes the money and is picked up by sheriff Randy Quaid (as Mike) and his deputies. Everyone wants the money, but the entire town is flooding fast... "Hard Rain" is presented by the successful "Speed" driven (1994) team of Mark Gordon and Graham Yost, and it features even more of the same non-stop high energy. Mikael Salomon makes the action look good. Characterization is secondary. You don't care about the leading men (and woman) - although, there must be some points given to Slater trying to escape from a jail cell while flood waters rise, and love interest Minnie Driver (as Karen) suffering through an attempted rape by "Penthouse" forum reader Mark Rolston (as Wayne) while she is handcuffed to a banister... Otherwise, the only thing noteworthy about the bigger cast names is their various levels of profanity. As you might expect, Betty White (as Doreen) comes out swinging, but Mr. Quaid finishes strong. Unfortunately, Ms. White and Edward "Ed" Asner (as Charlie) share no scenes; it would have been nice to see the two "Mary Tyler Moore" alumni together. More impressive are the lesser-known players, like trigger-happy Michael Goorjian (as Kenny) and distinctly featured Peter Murnik (as Phil). Action is more exciting when accompanied by strong characterization. ***** Hard Rain (1/16/98) Mikael Salomon ~ Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver, Randy Quaid

    Finally caught this film on cable and thoroughly enjoyed it. A rain drenched town flooded to the gills with Christian Slater as an armored truck guard protecting three million from a band of outlaws. This is a suburban Poseidon Adventure with many superb set pieces that continuously entertains and includes some great moments of suspense. Watching bandits blaze through high school corridors on Jet Skis in pursuit of Slater was a great highlight. In an age before CGI dominated every film it is refreshing to see practical - not animated effects with actual water flooding the roads, homes, alleys and buildings of a small Indiana town. Slater and Minnie Driver have a nice chemistry and Morgan Freeman always strong turns in a top notch performance. Some nice cameo appearance from Betty White and Richard Dysart liven up the action and add a few chuckles along the way. There are few adventure films today that provide the same escapist entertainment as Hard Rain. Put this one in your queue, it's solid entertainment where action and suspense reign hard.

    Sometimes a movie will appear that nobody has heard anything about; there is no hype nor is there any expectations. Even moreso, these movies will be brilliant, as is Hard Rain. I first heard about this movie on an add the day it opened in the cinema and thought "this might be good." I went and saw it and said, "This is brilliant". Hard Rain is an action movie. It could be a disaster movie with a plot, but it is not. The disaster has already happened. A huge torrent of rain has descended upon a town and has flooded it out and everybody has evacuated. The banks need their money moved to dry ground, so an armoured car comes and picks it up. With three million dollars in the back of this car, somebody is going to want it. That is were Jim (Morgan Freeman) and his gang of thieves come into the movie. They plan to steal the money, but the driver Tom (Christian Slater) manages to get away with it and hide it. Thus a chase across a flooded town where the waters are slowly rising begins. But it is not simply just that because the plot begins to twist, but I won't say anything about it. They say that movies which involve lots of water, such as Titanic and Waterworld, cost a lot of money to make. They also say that rain is very expensive. This movie floods out an entire town, to a point where the statue in the town square is completely inundated, and it rains continuously. The only scenes were it is not raining is when people are inside. This movie is definitely big budget, but it is well worth the price of a cinema ticket. Another thing a friend said. Most Hollywood movies you know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are within the first few minutes. Some movies, like Terminator II, you are not meant to know, but you do anyway. One of the major themes with the movie is that people are not who they seem and first impressions are not always the ones you count on. Everybody in this movie has a part of them that we do not expect. It is not an unrealistic change, but rather a change that comes over people when the opportunity appears. Three Million Dollars is a lot of money, and only the most honest person will not part with it. It is also how the relationships between the characters change. Karen (Minnie Driver) first takes Tom to be a looter who broke into her church to steal money, but what she doesn't know is that he is being chased by crooks. Jim is a crook and Tom takes him to be a killer. He believes that it was Jim that killed his uncle and that Jim would kill him to as soon as he found the money. The other characters are interesting as well, with the hotheaded young crook who acts on instinct. Jim expects this heist to go off perfect, but the youth, with is quick thinking and itchy trigger finger, creates a big problem. The Negro is also an interesting character for he quotes bible verses that relate to floods. This is not to say that he is a Christian, but rather that he has a mystical aura about him. Karen has also changed, though not on screen. She left town a girl and returned a woman. She used to be wild at heart, according to the deputy, and has now returned a woman too good for anybody else.

    As a movie with water, lots and lots and water, it's actually not that bad. But as a typical action picture, it's got villains that aren't mean enough, and don't seem quite determined enough (to get what they want, that is) for this movie to be something truly exciting. It's nice to see Morgan Freeman playing a bad guy, but he smiles a couple times (and I'm not talking about evil smiles), which is kind of a cheat. Give the characters a little more personality, ratchet the suspense a little, speed up the action, and this could have been a top-notch movie. And aside from comic relief, the two elderly characters (one of them played by Betty White), are unnecessary. *** out of ****

    Hard Rain comes at us like a rigid and thoroughly uneven, although enjoyable in that way things that are less than perfect sometimes are, soft-back pulp novel; a heist story with a twist and its own unique selling point; in this case, the fact that it will rain just as much as throughout the piece it has done the last week leading up to these events, which in turn will lead to rising water levels no doubt destined to prove a problem to those within. The film's catalyst is the robbing of an armoured van, a heist movie idea which, chances are, isn't anything we haven't seen before, and yet we smile at the places the film takes us; enjoy the application of this idea that the water levels are rising at a gross rate and have fun with this hybridisation of the varying disaster movie conventions which rear up with crime movie archetypes. Swedish director Mikael Salomon is having fun, and we're having fun with him; he seems to spend most of the film channelling a kind of mock-Western genre aesthetic to the overall film. Such a thing begins with the opening shot, a heck of an opening shot in truth during which a long tracking shot begins in the sky and floats across the more rural parts of the town before arriving in the centre within which we observe people being evacuated. Flying down to ground level, we note the harmonica music and the boarded up windows belonging to varying businesses in what is a launching of the film's Western tendencies. It is perhaps true to say the film's ambition does not match this opening. The film comes to unfold within a locale very much cut off from the rest of the world; under the characters' feet, water replaces sand and dirt but a small isolated town eventually succumbs to corruption and two people whom are initially at odds must pool resources to survive. One character, the instigator of the heist played by Morgan Freeman, waltzes throughout the film donning a stetson, whereas the hapless lead, a victim of this van robbery played by Christian Slater, even finds time to bury the treasures numerous parties are gunning for in a graveyard evoking Leone's The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. We begin with the Sheriff of the town directing traffic away from the town; he is Randy Quaid's Mike Collins, and works with a number of deputies. After an establishment of some of his more pleasant; more helping characteristics, the temperature of his presence on screen briefly changes when the town's mayor drives by and off, and Collins briefly reveals a franker nature when he expresses his disdain for the man. Not so far away is Slater's character, a young armoured van guard named Tom standing in a bank lugging large bags of money with an accomplice in a faceless and anonymous fashion. It is revealed they are not robbing, but removing; so as to transport the cash away from the soon to be water-logged town to safety. The initial establishment of these people as folk to be wary of precedes a revealing of their more genuine nature, in that they are upstanding and present on justified terms; something that encapsulates this idea of transition later becoming more prominent and standing in equal measure to that of Collins and his deputies, whose natures began as helping and unassuming before taking a nastier turn. Tom reiterates that there is little adventure in his life, although he would like there to be, while his partner in security points out that when he was Tom's age, he too suffered from a great lack of 'happening' in his life. This alludes to an apparent lack of life experience, and aids in increasing tension as later events play out  events of which we doubt Tom will be able to rise to. Then there is Freeman's character, Jim - an ageing man seemingly too embittered to even raise his voice; a man whom forms a posse with three others, each epitomising varying clich&eacute;s in that the glasses wearing nerd; the wise-cracking, bible-quoting African American and the hot-headed kid make up his troup&eacute;. They plan to hit the truck, the cash being Jim's "retirement fund" in the fleeting few hours he'll probably get to spend it out of dropping dead with hypothermia. When he stands in a sparsely populated bar early on, he deals with a situation involving one of his gang and their exuberance with a crossword puzzle in a newspaper, in what is an instance of the man dealing with a scenario in a calm; creative and intuitional manner which should bode well for certain later exchanges. The bulk of the film consists of surprisingly engrossing chase as well as neatly unfolded allegiances which come to differ throughout; Salomon's film a series of really rather well constructed set pieces involving causality, rescue and evasion which come together and work much more than they have any right to. The director, a man whose work I had not come across in any other capacity prior to first seeing this guilty pleasure several years ago, nor indeed have I experience any since, keeps things chugging along without trying to dress it up as anything it isn't. Hard Rain is a film difficult not to get into, and tough to really dislike.

    Hard Rain is an action adventure thriller movie. The main thrust of the plot concerns the efforts of security guard Tom (Christian Slater) to prevent assorted hoodlums from stealing the money he and his partner are transporting. The unusual element of this movie is that it takes place during a deluge which has resulted in extensive flooding, so most of the action takes place in and around a town which is almost underwater. Considering that the main appeal of the movie is the water-based locations, action and stunts, the film-makers have done quite a good job in providing a plot with a number of twists, and characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs. OK, so not much more, admittedly, but there is still an element of depth to them (the water in town is deeper)(sorry). But the semi-aquatic realm in which the movie is set is flawlessly realised. The main track through town (along which boats race), and the water-filled interiors of the school, the jail, a church, and assorted houses - all are absolutely convincing, as is the action which takes place in them. This is a very enjoyable movie with a most unusual premise.

    It's an armoured-car heist. And apparently, the villains not only knew when it was going to set off, how much was in it, and which way it was going; they also knew what the weather would be like en-route. Now that's forward planning! The old geezer driving it is apparently the villains' inside man. He drives the truck into a road flood, stalling the engine. Now all the gang have to do is turn-up in a boat and help themselves. Starring Pixie-faced Christian Slater as the honest sidekick; he puts up a fight which results in the old guy being gunned-down. After that, he hides the money and runs. The villains give chase. They need him alive in order to know where he's hidden it. Cue all manner of water sports. The rain is incessant (though not heavy enough to put out a simple church-roof fire). Flooding worsens. The dam breaks. Minnie (donkey jaws) Driver appears as a restorer of stained-glass windows, giving her usual acting-by-numbers turn. The sheriff goes crooked at the thought of $3 million, so enmity and loyalty become ambiguous though offer few additional thrills. Shooting gets almost incessant, mostly to little effect. In the end; it's boring. For me, the biggest problem is that non of the characters move me to care for them. The old guy, who might have excited sympathy, was one of the gang. Slater's and Driver's characters both incline towards the unbelievable. The rest are mostly just cameos of one particular human trait or another. The most heavyweight and potentially likable character is that of Morgan Freeman. But he is the lead baddie. And while he may not have wanted anyone hurt, it nevertheless happens and on his watch. If you don't care about the characters, then you don't care what happens to them, so there's no story to speak of. It's basically a thick slice of robbery ham, to which floods of water do not bring the additional drama its makers had hoped. One-watch hokum, can't recommend it. Incidentally; by 1998, armoured cars in Britain contained 'a locked safe to which the crew had no access', a homing device that was tamper-proof, explosive dye-bags that would render money un-useable, and 'smart-water' contaminants. Apparently the Yanks need to modernise. Mind how you go.

    I discovered this movie because there is Minnie Driver in it and i must say that this is a great one! Except "War of worlds" by Spielberg, i don't know a movie with such an apocalyptic setting: Mother Nature is set loose and threatens to flood everything. But instead of focusing with megalopolises (NY, LA) and calling for the President, this realistic movie happens in a little town of Indiana. Thus, it is closes to our every day life and we can better understand the threat. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but there is a Gothic feeling here that enhances everything. It's the night, the town is surrounded by forest, and a lot of action happens on the cemetery and the church. And if it's an action / thriller movie, actually, some shoots reminds me of the best horror movies. Then, i found all the characters very attractive: you either care for them or despise them at once. And, they aren't one-sided characters because along the movie, their polarity changes: good guys become bad, and bad guys become good.

Jim expects this heist to go off perfect, but the youth, with is quick thinking and itchy trigger finger, creates a big problem. The Negro is also an interesting character for he quotes bible verses that relate to floods. This is not to say that he is a Christian, but rather that he has a mystical aura about him. Karen has also changed, though not on screen. She left town a girl and returned a woman. She used to be wild at heart, according to the deputy, and has now returned a woman too good for anybody else.

    As a movie with water, lots and lots and water, it's actually not that bad. But as a typical action picture, it's got villains that aren't mean enough, and don't seem quite determined enough (to get what they want, that is) for this movie to be something truly exciting. It's nice to see Morgan Freeman playing a bad guy, but he smiles a couple times (and I'm not talking about evil smiles), which is kind of a cheat. Give the characters a little more personality, ratchet the suspense a little, speed up the action, and this could have been a top-notch movie. And aside from comic relief, the two elderly characters (one of them played by Betty White), are unnecessary. *** out of ****

    Hard Rain comes at us like a rigid and thoroughly uneven, although enjoyable in that way things that are less than perfect sometimes are, soft-back pulp novel; a heist story with a twist and its own unique selling point; in this case, the fact that it will rain just as much as throughout the piece it has done the last week leading up to these events, which in turn will lead to rising water levels no doubt destined to prove a problem to those within. The film's catalyst is the robbing of an armoured van, a heist movie idea which, chances are, isn't anything we haven't seen before, and yet we smile at the places the film takes us; enjoy the application of this idea that the water levels are rising at a gross rate and have fun with this hybridisation of the varying disaster movie conventions which rear up with crime movie archetypes. Swedish director Mikael Salomon is having fun, and we're having fun with him; he seems to spend most of the film channelling a kind of mock-Western genre aesthetic to the overall film. Such a thing begins with the opening shot, a heck of an opening shot in truth during which a long tracking shot begins in the sky and floats across the more rural parts of the town before arriving in the centre within which we observe people being evacuated. Flying down to ground level, we note the harmonica music and the boarded up windows belonging to varying businesses in what is a launching of the film's Western tendencies. It is perhaps true to say the film's ambition does not match this opening. The film comes to unfold within a locale very much cut off from the rest of the world; under the characters' feet, water replaces sand and dirt but a small isolated town eventually succumbs to corruption and two people whom are initially at odds must pool resources to survive. One character, the instigator of the heist played by Morgan Freeman, waltzes throughout the film donning a stetson, whereas the hapless lead, a victim of this van robbery played by Christian Slater, even finds time to bury the treasures numerous parties are gunning for in a graveyard evoking Leone's The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. We begin with the Sheriff of the town directing traffic away from the town; he is Randy Quaid's Mike Collins, and works with a number of deputies. After an establishment of some of his more pleasant; more helping characteristics, the temperature of his presence on screen briefly changes when the town's mayor drives by and off, and Collins briefly reveals a franker nature when he expresses his disdain for the man. Not so far away is Slater's character, a young armoured van guard named Tom standing in a bank lugging large bags of money with an accomplice in a faceless and anonymous fashion. It is revealed they are not robbing, but removing; so as to transport the cash away from the soon to be water-logged town to safety. The initial establishment of these people as folk to be wary of precedes a revealing of their more genuine nature, in that they are upstanding and present on justified terms; something that encapsulates this idea of transition later becoming more prominent and standing in equal measure to that of Collins and his deputies, whose natures began as helping and unassuming before taking a nastier turn. Tom reiterates that there is little adventure in his life, although he would like there to be, while his partner in security points out that when he was Tom's age, he too suffered from a great lack of 'happening' in his life. This alludes to an apparent lack of life experience, and aids in increasing tension as later events play out  events of which we doubt Tom will be able to rise to. Then there is Freeman's character, Jim - an ageing man seemingly too embittered to even raise his voice; a man whom forms a posse with three others, each epitomising varying clich&eacute;s in that the glasses wearing nerd; the wise-cracking, bible-quoting African American and the hot-headed kid make up his troup&eacute;. They plan to hit the truck, the cash being Jim's "retirement fund" in the fleeting few hours he'll probably get to spend it out of dropping dead with hypothermia. When he stands in a sparsely populated bar early on, he deals with a situation involving one of his gang and their exuberance with a crossword puzzle in a newspaper, in what is an instance of the man dealing with a scenario in a calm; creative and intuitional manner which should bode well for certain later exchanges. The bulk of the film consists of surprisingly engrossing chase as well as neatly unfolded allegiances which come to differ throughout; Salomon's film a series of really rather well constructed set pieces involving causality, rescue and evasion which come together and work much more than they have any right to. The director, a man whose work I had not come across in any other capacity prior to first seeing this guilty pleasure several years ago, nor indeed have I experience any since, keeps things chugging along without trying to dress it up as anything it isn't. Hard Rain is a film difficult not to get into, and tough to really dislike.

    Hard Rain is an action adventure thriller movie. The main thrust of the plot concerns the efforts of security guard Tom (Christian Slater) to prevent assorted hoodlums from stealing the money he and his partner are transporting. The unusual element of this movie is that it takes place during a deluge which has resulted in extensive flooding, so most of the action takes place in and around a town which is almost underwater. Considering that the main appeal of the movie is the water-based locations, action and stunts, the film-makers have done quite a good job in providing a plot with a number of twists, and characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs. OK, so not much more, admittedly, but there is still an element of depth to them (the water in town is deeper)(sorry). But the semi-aquatic realm in which the movie is set is flawlessly realised. The main track through town (along which boats race), and the water-filled interiors of the school, the jail, a church, and assorted houses - all are absolutely convincing, as is the action which takes place in them. This is a very enjoyable movie with a most unusual premise.

    It's an armoured-car heist. And apparently, the villains not only knew when it was going to set off, how much was in it, and which way it was going; they also knew what the weather would be like en-route. Now that's forward planning! The old geezer driving it is apparently the villains' inside man. He drives the truck into a road flood, stalling the engine. Now all the gang have to do is turn-up in a boat and help themselves. Starring Pixie-faced Christian Slater as the honest sidekick; he puts up a fight which results in the old guy being gunned-down. After that, he hides the money and runs. The villains give chase. They need him alive in order to know where he's hidden it. Cue all manner of water sports. The rain is incessant (though not heavy enough to put out a simple church-roof fire). Flooding worsens. The dam breaks. Minnie (donkey jaws) Driver appears as a restorer of stained-glass windows, giving her usual acting-by-numbers turn. The sheriff goes crooked at the thought of $3 million, so enmity and loyalty become ambiguous though offer few additional thrills. Shooting gets almost incessant, mostly to little effect. In the end; it's boring. For me, the biggest problem is that non of the characters move me to care for them. The old guy, who might have excited sympathy, was one of the gang. Slater's and Driver's characters both incline towards the unbelievable. The rest are mostly just cameos of one particular human trait or another. The most heavyweight and potentially likable character is that of Morgan Freeman. But he is the lead baddie. And while he may not have wanted anyone hurt, it nevertheless happens and on his watch. If you don't care about the characters, then you don't care what happens to them, so there's no story to speak of. It's basically a thick slice of robbery ham, to which floods of water do not bring the additional drama its makers had hoped. One-watch hokum, can't recommend it. Incidentally; by 1998, armoured cars in Britain contained 'a locked safe to which the crew had no access', a homing device that was tamper-proof, explosive dye-bags that would render money un-useable, and 'smart-water' contaminants. Apparently the Yanks need to modernise. Mind how you go.

    I discovered this movie because there is Minnie Driver in it and i must say that this is a great one! Except "War of worlds" by Spielberg, i don't know a movie with such an apocalyptic setting: Mother Nature is set loose and threatens to flood everything. But instead of focusing with megalopolises (NY, LA) and calling for the President, this realistic movie happens in a little town of Indiana. Thus, it is closes to our every day life and we can better understand the threat. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but there is a Gothic feeling here that enhances everything. It's the night, the town is surrounded by forest, and a lot of action happens on the cemetery and the church. And if it's an action / thriller movie, actually, some shoots reminds me of the best horror movies. Then, i found all the characters very attractive: you either care for them or despise them at once. And, they aren't one-sided characters because along the movie, their polarity changes: good guys become bad, and bad guys become good. Thus, it is very interesting to see that and the cast does have mention because they make that happen. As a fan of Minnie, i found that she has truly something because she is 100% believable in this action / comedy part whereas other actress would have failed. I never heard of the director before but he knows how to deliver great sequences: the opening credits give the mood for the entire movie and you will find all the threats from flooding. In conclusion, this upside down "Abyss" is an excellent tale and if you can find it, dive in it !

    Tom (Christian Slater), is a guard-jury that leads with his partner a van armored transport of money. Approximately giant floods in the city by the have to go through and it is evacuated. Tom and his partner they will be guarding three million dollars pursued by criminals. It is an exciting film of action that gives no respite, hectic from beginning to end, with excellent scenes full of vertigo and extreme tension. Action is pure, to entertain and pass the time. The look from the gender, the film plays very well with the goal. In this genre what more is to be assessed are the sensations, and this is an objective widely exceeded. The atmosphere anguish of a people under the threat of flooding by the breaking of a dam. coupled with a plan to steal a van armored, is a situation in which you can take advantage easily. Mikael Salomon in this movie get his work. Film it wanted take advantage of the strain that had once again the disaster movie in the mid 1990, this time, with the disastrous panorama that cause a flood, although its authors carried the story more by the gender police. One of the changes that occurred in the film was the title, because they went through several, the most considered "The Flood" in reference to the catastrophe in question, but changed in the last time by "Hard Rain", title more police. The script is the strong point, no lapses at any time, and is appreciated that is not so predictable. It is easy to follow, entertaining and fluid, without such drastic changes so disconcerting and occasionally credible. Good visual effects in the parties that truly movie needed. A ambiance and mounting distinguished. We really immersed in the scenario that we proposed Mikael Solomon. The performances are very good. Randy Quaid "Independence Day" with magnificent performance as corrupt police and greedy, Morgan Freeman always sober and blunt .Christian Slater confirms that he's more than a simple actor from " Der Name der Rose " with Sean Connery). The rest of the cast is makes a performance acceptable.

    Hard Rain is something different than your average disaster movie. It takes place in a small town in Indiana. Where remaining survivors are scavenging to save what they have left before the flood. And when two "armor truck guard" buddies are in center of a plot to heist the armor truck for 3 million dollars. All heck becomes a desperate plan to survive for Hale(Christian Slater) when a crew of hired arms lead by Jim(Morgan Freeman) who have mistakenly sidetracked their plan and have to chase him through the flood of the entire town... Lots of action, thrills, and some surprisingly amazing acting from Randy Quaid as the sheriff. Along with cast as Mini Driver, Christian Slater, Ed Asner, and of course Morgan Freeman.. One of my top favorites and a enjoyable movie..

    In rain-drenched Huntingburg, Indiana, "Armored Transport" guard Christian Slater (as Tom) loads over $3 million dollars in his truck. While trying to transport the money out of town during a particularly wicked storm, Mr. Slater's truck gets stuck in rising rain waters. This makes the money an easy target for crooked Morgan Freeman (as Jim) and his gang; they move to rob the truck, but Slater escapes with the cash. Slater stashes the money and is picked up by sheriff Randy Quaid (as Mike) and his deputies. Everyone wants the money, but the entire town is flooding fast... "Hard Rain" is presented by the successful "Speed" driven (1994) team of Mark Gordon and Graham Yost, and it features even more of the same non-stop high energy. Mikael Salomon makes the action look good. Characterization is secondary. You don't care about the leading men (and woman) - although, there must be some points given to Slater trying to escape from a jail cell while flood waters rise, and love interest Minnie Driver (as Karen) suffering through an attempted rape by "Penthouse" forum reader Mark Rolston (as Wayne) while she is handcuffed to a banister... Otherwise, the only thing noteworthy about the bigger cast names is their various levels of profanity. As you might expect, Betty White (as Doreen) comes out swinging, but Mr. Quaid finishes strong. Unfortunately, Ms. White and Edward "Ed" Asner (as Charlie) share no scenes; it would have been nice to see the two "Mary Tyler Moore" alumni together. More impressive are the lesser-known players, like trigger-happy Michael Goorjian (as Kenny) and distinctly featured Peter Murnik (as Phil). Action is more exciting when accompanied by strong characterization. ***** Hard Rain (1/16/98) Mikael Salomon ~ Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver, Randy Quaid

    Finally caught this film on cable and thoroughly enjoyed it. A rain drenched town flooded to the gills with Christian Slater as an armored truck guard protecting three million from a band of outlaws. This is a suburban Poseidon Adventure with many superb set pieces that continuously entertains and includes some great moments of suspense. Watching bandits blaze through high school corridors on Jet Skis in pursuit of Slater was a great highlight. In an age before CGI dominated every film it is refreshing to see practical - not animated effects with actual water flooding the roads, homes, alleys and buildings of a small Indiana town. Slater and Minnie Driver have a nice chemistry and Morgan Freeman always strong turns in a top notch performance. Some nice cameo appearance from Betty White and Richard Dysart liven up the action and add a few chuckles along the way. There are few adventure films today that provide the same escapist entertainment as Hard Rain. Put this one in your queue, it's solid entertainment where action and suspense reign hard.

    Sometimes a movie will appear that nobody has heard anything about; there is no hype nor is there any expectations. Even moreso, these movies will be brilliant, as is Hard Rain. I first heard about this movie on an add the day it opened in the cinema and thought "this might be good." I went and saw it and said, "This is brilliant". Hard Rain is an action movie. It could be a disaster movie with a plot, but it is not. The disaster has already happened. A huge torrent of rain has descended upon a town and has flooded it out and everybody has evacuated. The banks need their money moved to dry ground, so an armoured car comes and picks it up. With three million dollars in the back of this car, somebody is going to want it. That is were Jim (Morgan Freeman) and his gang of thieves come into the movie. They plan to steal the money, but the driver Tom (Christian Slater) manages to get away with it and hide it. Thus a chase across a flooded town where the waters are slowly rising begins. But it is not simply just that because the plot begins to twist, but I won't say anything about it. They say that movies which involve lots of water, such as Titanic and Waterworld, cost a lot of money to make. They also say that rain is very expensive. This movie floods out an entire town, to a point where the statue in the town square is completely inundated, and it rains continuously. The only scenes were it is not raining is when people are inside. This movie is definitely big budget, but it is well worth the price of a cinema ticket. Another thing a friend said. Most Hollywood movies you know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are within the first few minutes. Some movies, like Terminator II, you are not meant to know, but you do anyway. One of the major themes with the movie is that people are not who they seem and first impressions are not always the ones you count on. Everybody in this movie has a part of them that we do not expect. It is not an unrealistic change, but rather a change that comes over people when the opportunity appears. Three Million Dollars is a lot of money, and only the most honest person will not part with it. It is also how the relationships between the characters change. Karen (Minnie Driver) first takes Tom to be a looter who broke into her church to steal money, but what she doesn't know is that he is being chased by crooks. Jim is a crook and Tom takes him to be a killer. He believes that it was Jim that killed his uncle and that Jim would kill him to as soon as he found the money. The other characters are interesting as well, with the hotheaded young crook who acts on instinct. Jim expects this heist to go off perfect, but the youth, with is quick thinking and itchy trigger finger, creates a big problem. The Negro is also an interesting character for he quotes bible verses that relate to floods. This is not to say that he is a Christian, but rather that he has a mystical aura about him. Karen has also changed, though not on screen. She left town a girl and returned a woman. She used to be wild at heart, according to the deputy, and has now returned a woman too good for anybody else.

Apparently the Yanks need to modernise. Mind how you go.

    I discovered this movie because there is Minnie Driver in it and i must say that this is a great one! Except "War of worlds" by Spielberg, i don't know a movie with such an apocalyptic setting: Mother Nature is set loose and threatens to flood everything. But instead of focusing with megalopolises (NY, LA) and calling for the President, this realistic movie happens in a little town of Indiana. Thus, it is closes to our every day life and we can better understand the threat. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but there is a Gothic feeling here that enhances everything. It's the night, the town is surrounded by forest, and a lot of action happens on the cemetery and the church. And if it's an action / thriller movie, actually, some shoots reminds me of the best horror movies. Then, i found all the characters very attractive: you either care for them or despise them at once. And, they aren't one-sided characters because along the movie, their polarity changes: good guys become bad, and bad guys become good. Thus, it is very interesting to see that and the cast does have mention because they make that happen. As a fan of Minnie, i found that she has truly something because she is 100% believable in this action / comedy part whereas other actress would have failed. I never heard of the director before but he knows how to deliver great sequences: the opening credits give the mood for the entire movie and you will find all the threats from flooding. In conclusion, this upside down "Abyss" is an excellent tale and if you can find it, dive in it !

    Tom (Christian Slater), is a guard-jury that leads with his partner a van armored transport of money. Approximately giant floods in the city by the have to go through and it is evacuated. Tom and his partner they will be guarding three million dollars pursued by criminals. It is an exciting film of action that gives no respite, hectic from beginning to end, with excellent scenes full of vertigo and extreme tension. Action is pure, to entertain and pass the time. The look from the gender, the film plays very well with the goal. In this genre what more is to be assessed are the sensations, and this is an objective widely exceeded. The atmosphere anguish of a people under the threat of flooding by the breaking of a dam. coupled with a plan to steal a van armored, is a situation in which you can take advantage easily. Mikael Salomon in this movie get his work. Film it wanted take advantage of the strain that had once again the disaster movie in the mid 1990, this time, with the disastrous panorama that cause a flood, although its authors carried the story more by the gender police. One of the changes that occurred in the film was the title, because they went through several, the most considered "The Flood" in reference to the catastrophe in question, but changed in the last time by "Hard Rain", title more police. The script is the strong point, no lapses at any time, and is appreciated that is not so predictable. It is easy to follow, entertaining and fluid, without such drastic changes so disconcerting and occasionally credible. Good visual effects in the parties that truly movie needed. A ambiance and mounting distinguished. We really immersed in the scenario that we proposed Mikael Solomon. The performances are very good. Randy Quaid "Independence Day" with magnificent performance as corrupt police and greedy, Morgan Freeman always sober and blunt .Christian Slater confirms that he's more than a simple actor from " Der Name der Rose " with Sean Connery). The rest of the cast is makes a performance acceptable.

    Hard Rain is something different than your average disaster movie. It takes place in a small town in Indiana. Where remaining survivors are scavenging to save what they have left before the flood. And when two "armor truck guard" buddies are in center of a plot to heist the armor truck for 3 million dollars. All heck becomes a desperate plan to survive for Hale(Christian Slater) when a crew of hired arms lead by Jim(Morgan Freeman) who have mistakenly sidetracked their plan and have to chase him through the flood of the entire town... Lots of action, thrills, and some surprisingly amazing acting from Randy Quaid as the sheriff. Along with cast as Mini Driver, Christian Slater, Ed Asner, and of course Morgan Freeman.. One of my top favorites and a enjoyable movie..

    In rain-drenched Huntingburg, Indiana, "Armored Transport" guard Christian Slater (as Tom) loads over $3 million dollars in his truck. While trying to transport the money out of town during a particularly wicked storm, Mr. Slater's truck gets stuck in rising rain waters. This makes the money an easy target for crooked Morgan Freeman (as Jim) and his gang; they move to rob the truck, but Slater escapes with the cash. Slater stashes the money and is picked up by sheriff Randy Quaid (as Mike) and his deputies. Everyone wants the money, but the entire town is flooding fast... "Hard Rain" is presented by the successful "Speed" driven (1994) team of Mark Gordon and Graham Yost, and it features even more of the same non-stop high energy. Mikael Salomon makes the action look good. Characterization is secondary. You don't care about the leading men (and woman) - although, there must be some points given to Slater trying to escape from a jail cell while flood waters rise, and love interest Minnie Driver (as Karen) suffering through an attempted rape by "Penthouse" forum reader Mark Rolston (as Wayne) while she is handcuffed to a banister... Otherwise, the only thing noteworthy about the bigger cast names is their various levels of profanity. As you might expect, Betty White (as Doreen) comes out swinging, but Mr. Quaid finishes strong. Unfortunately, Ms. White and Edward "Ed" Asner (as Charlie) share no scenes; it would have been nice to see the two "Mary Tyler Moore" alumni together. More impressive are the lesser-known players, like trigger-happy Michael Goorjian (as Kenny) and distinctly featured Peter Murnik (as Phil). Action is more exciting when accompanied by strong characterization. ***** Hard Rain (1/16/98) Mikael Salomon ~ Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver, Randy Quaid

    Finally caught this film on cable and thoroughly enjoyed it. A rain drenched town flooded to the gills with Christian Slater as an armored truck guard protecting three million from a band of outlaws. This is a suburban Poseidon Adventure with many superb set pieces that continuously entertains and includes some great moments of suspense. Watching bandits blaze through high school corridors on Jet Skis in pursuit of Slater was a great highlight. In an age before CGI dominated every film it is refreshing to see practical - not animated effects with actual water flooding the roads, homes, alleys and buildings of a small Indiana town. Slater and Minnie Driver have a nice chemistry and Morgan Freeman always strong turns in a top notch performance. Some nice cameo appearance from Betty White and Richard Dysart liven up the action and add a few chuckles along the way. There are few adventure films today that provide the same escapist entertainment as Hard Rain. Put this one in your queue, it's solid entertainment where action and suspense reign hard.

    Sometimes a movie will appear that nobody has heard anything about; there is no hype nor is there any expectations. Even moreso, these movies will be brilliant, as is Hard Rain. I first heard about this movie on an add the day it opened in the cinema and thought "this might be good." I went and saw it and said, "This is brilliant". Hard Rain is an action movie. It could be a disaster movie with a plot, but it is not. The disaster has already happened. A huge torrent of rain has descended upon a town and has flooded it out and everybody has evacuated. The banks need their money moved to dry ground, so an armoured car comes and picks it up. With three million dollars in the back of this car, somebody is going to want it. That is were Jim (Morgan Freeman) and his gang of thieves come into the movie. They plan to steal the money, but the driver Tom (Christian Slater) manages to get away with it and hide it. Thus a chase across a flooded town where the waters are slowly rising begins. But it is not simply just that because the plot begins to twist, but I won't say anything about it. They say that movies which involve lots of water, such as Titanic and Waterworld, cost a lot of money to make. They also say that rain is very expensive. This movie floods out an entire town, to a point where the statue in the town square is completely inundated, and it rains continuously. The only scenes were it is not raining is when people are inside. This movie is definitely big budget, but it is well worth the price of a cinema ticket. Another thing a friend said. Most Hollywood movies you know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are within the first few minutes. Some movies, like Terminator II, you are not meant to know, but you do anyway. One of the major themes with the movie is that people are not who they seem and first impressions are not always the ones you count on. Everybody in this movie has a part of them that we do not expect. It is not an unrealistic change, but rather a change that comes over people when the opportunity appears. Three Million Dollars is a lot of money, and only the most honest person will not part with it. It is also how the relationships between the characters change. Karen (Minnie Driver) first takes Tom to be a looter who broke into her church to steal money, but what she doesn't know is that he is being chased by crooks. Jim is a crook and Tom takes him to be a killer. He believes that it was Jim that killed his uncle and that Jim would kill him to as soon as he found the money. The other characters are interesting as well, with the hotheaded young crook who acts on instinct. Jim expects this heist to go off perfect, but the youth, with is quick thinking and itchy trigger finger, creates a big problem. The Negro is also an interesting character for he quotes bible verses that relate to floods. This is not to say that he is a Christian, but rather that he has a mystical aura about him. Karen has also changed, though not on screen. She left town a girl and returned a woman. She used to be wild at heart, according to the deputy, and has now returned a woman too good for anybody else.

    As a movie with water, lots and lots and water, it's actually not that bad. But as a typical action picture, it's got villains that aren't mean enough, and don't seem quite determined enough (to get what they want, that is) for this movie to be something truly exciting. It's nice to see Morgan Freeman playing a bad guy, but he smiles a couple times (and I'm not talking about evil smiles), which is kind of a cheat. Give the characters a little more personality, ratchet the suspense a little, speed up the action, and this could have been a top-notch movie. And aside from comic relief, the two elderly characters (one of them played by Betty White), are unnecessary. *** out of ****

    Hard Rain comes at us like a rigid and thoroughly uneven, although enjoyable in that way things that are less than perfect sometimes are, soft-back pulp novel; a heist story with a twist and its own unique selling point; in this case, the fact that it will rain just as much as throughout the piece it has done the last week leading up to these events, which in turn will lead to rising water levels no doubt destined to prove a problem to those within. The film's catalyst is the robbing of an armoured van, a heist movie idea which, chances are, isn't anything we haven't seen before, and yet we smile at the places the film takes us; enjoy the application of this idea that the water levels are rising at a gross rate and have fun with this hybridisation of the varying disaster movie conventions which rear up with crime movie archetypes. Swedish director Mikael Salomon is having fun, and we're having fun with him; he seems to spend most of the film channelling a kind of mock-Western genre aesthetic to the overall film. Such a thing begins with the opening shot, a heck of an opening shot in truth during which a long tracking shot begins in the sky and floats across the more rural parts of the town before arriving in the centre within which we observe people being evacuated. Flying down to ground level, we note the harmonica music and the boarded up windows belonging to varying businesses in what is a launching of the film's Western tendencies. It is perhaps true to say the film's ambition does not match this opening. The film comes to unfold within a locale very much cut off from the rest of the world; under the characters' feet, water replaces sand and dirt but a small isolated town eventually succumbs to corruption and two people whom are initially at odds must pool resources to survive. One character, the instigator of the heist played by Morgan Freeman, waltzes throughout the film donning a stetson, whereas the hapless lead, a victim of this van robbery played by Christian Slater, even finds time to bury the treasures numerous parties are gunning for in a graveyard evoking Leone's The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. We begin with the Sheriff of the town directing traffic away from the town; he is Randy Quaid's Mike Collins, and works with a number of deputies. After an establishment of some of his more pleasant; more helping characteristics, the temperature of his presence on screen briefly changes when the town's mayor drives by and off, and Collins briefly reveals a franker nature when he expresses his disdain for the man. Not so far away is Slater's character, a young armoured van guard named Tom standing in a bank lugging large bags of money with an accomplice in a faceless and anonymous fashion. It is revealed they are not robbing, but removing; so as to transport the cash away from the soon to be water-logged town to safety. The initial establishment of these people as folk to be wary of precedes a revealing of their more genuine nature, in that they are upstanding and present on justified terms; something that encapsulates this idea of transition later becoming more prominent and standing in equal measure to that of Collins and his deputies, whose natures began as helping and unassuming before taking a nastier turn. Tom reiterates that there is little adventure in his life, although he would like there to be, while his partner in security points out that when he was Tom's age, he too suffered from a great lack of 'happening' in his life. This alludes to an apparent lack of life experience, and aids in increasing tension as later events play out  events of which we doubt Tom will be able to rise to. Then there is Freeman's character, Jim - an ageing man seemingly too embittered to even raise his voice; a man whom forms a posse with three others, each epitomising varying clich&eacute;s in that the glasses wearing nerd; the wise-cracking, bible-quoting African American and the hot-headed kid make up his troup&eacute;. They plan to hit the truck, the cash being Jim's "retirement fund" in the fleeting few hours he'll probably get to spend it out of dropping dead with hypothermia. When he stands in a sparsely populated bar early on, he deals with a situation involving one of his gang and their exuberance with a crossword puzzle in a newspaper, in what is an instance of the man dealing with a scenario in a calm; creative and intuitional manner which should bode well for certain later exchanges. The bulk of the film consists of surprisingly engrossing chase as well as neatly unfolded allegiances which come to differ throughout; Salomon's film a series of really rather well constructed set pieces involving causality, rescue and evasion which come together and work much more than they have any right to. The director, a man whose work I had not come across in any other capacity prior to first seeing this guilty pleasure several years ago, nor indeed have I experience any since, keeps things chugging along without trying to dress it up as anything it isn't. Hard Rain is a film difficult not to get into, and tough to really dislike.

    Hard Rain is an action adventure thriller movie. The main thrust of the plot concerns the efforts of security guard Tom (Christian Slater) to prevent assorted hoodlums from stealing the money he and his partner are transporting. The unusual element of this movie is that it takes place during a deluge which has resulted in extensive flooding, so most of the action takes place in and around a town which is almost underwater. Considering that the main appeal of the movie is the water-based locations, action and stunts, the film-makers have done quite a good job in providing a plot with a number of twists, and characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs. OK, so not much more, admittedly, but there is still an element of depth to them (the water in town is deeper)(sorry). But the semi-aquatic realm in which the movie is set is flawlessly realised. The main track through town (along which boats race), and the water-filled interiors of the school, the jail, a church, and assorted houses - all are absolutely convincing, as is the action which takes place in them. This is a very enjoyable movie with a most unusual premise.

    It's an armoured-car heist. And apparently, the villains not only knew when it was going to set off, how much was in it, and which way it was going; they also knew what the weather would be like en-route. Now that's forward planning! The old geezer driving it is apparently the villains' inside man. He drives the truck into a road flood, stalling the engine. Now all the gang have to do is turn-up in a boat and help themselves. Starring Pixie-faced Christian Slater as the honest sidekick; he puts up a fight which results in the old guy being gunned-down. After that, he hides the money and runs. The villains give chase. They need him alive in order to know where he's hidden it. Cue all manner of water sports. The rain is incessant (though not heavy enough to put out a simple church-roof fire). Flooding worsens. The dam breaks. Minnie (donkey jaws) Driver appears as a restorer of stained-glass windows, giving her usual acting-by-numbers turn. The sheriff goes crooked at the thought of $3 million, so enmity and loyalty become ambiguous though offer few additional thrills. Shooting gets almost incessant, mostly to little effect. In the end; it's boring. For me, the biggest problem is that non of the characters move me to care for them. The old guy, who might have excited sympathy, was one of the gang. Slater's and Driver's characters both incline towards the unbelievable. The rest are mostly just cameos of one particular human trait or another. The most heavyweight and potentially likable character is that of Morgan Freeman. But he is the lead baddie. And while he may not have wanted anyone hurt, it nevertheless happens and on his watch. If you don't care about the characters, then you don't care what happens to them, so there's no story to speak of. It's basically a thick slice of robbery ham, to which floods of water do not bring the additional drama its makers had hoped. One-watch hokum, can't recommend it. Incidentally; by 1998, armoured cars in Britain contained 'a locked safe to which the crew had no access', a homing device that was tamper-proof, explosive dye-bags that would render money un-useable, and 'smart-water' contaminants. Apparently the Yanks need to modernise. Mind how you go.
