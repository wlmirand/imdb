    A top gangster called Frank White is released from prison and decides he wants to make a positive social contribution to his New York neighbourhood in the form of a public hospital. He requests help in this enterprise from his fellow gang lords, who refuse to co-operate, leading to a mob war. This gangster film was helmed by maverick director Abel Ferrara who specialises in gritty urban stories set in New York. This is one of his most accessible in many ways  it isn't quite as grim as the likes of The Driller Killer or Bad Lieutenant  but it's still a pretty typical bit of work. This one is all about moral ambiguity. Frank White eliminates his rivals because he doesn't like the ethics of their business practices, yet he still sells drugs on the streets to make money but he wants to use this cash to save a ghetto hospital. It's a film full of shades of grey. No one is good and no one is bad, everyone is in between. The criminals have a conscience, yet continue to commit crimes, while the police hunt these law breakers yet act like just another gang of thugs in doing so. The film is immeasurably helped by excellent acting from Christopher Walken in the central role. It's hardly surprising, seeing as Walken is a fantastic actor who always brings something interesting and compelling to dark roles such as this. There are a lot of great support players too, with good solid turns in particular from Laurence Fishburne and David Caruso. While the hip-hop soundtrack is very effective and adds to the sense of time and place. It's overall a very good crime movie.

    I give the title "King of Gangster Flicks" for many reasons.... no spoilers. First off, I would try to find the DVD release of this film, when I first viewed the movie a few years back it was on VHS and the quality of picture was rather poor (very dark, hard to tell what exactly was going on). With the DVD version it is much more of a pleasurable viewing experience, but only because of the picture quality. This film isn't cute, it doesn't hold back, and it doesn't cater to Hollywood or MTV ideals (Though it was pre-MTV as it is today)... IMO this stands right next to Scarface as it's ugly yankee twin brother .. Cocaine is visible in actor's noses, real-life sounding script w/out catch phrases meant to kickstart a merchandise line, rather unattractive cast and characters that make this movie a real mean flick. Most people confuse this for bad acting and dialogue, but what's meant to be portrayed here is gangsters without the glitter and fame and Hollywood- ization, this movie goes for truth. I had to watch the movie several times to fully digest what was going on as this movie doesn't have training wheels either, it's a straight up cold blooded gangster film that makes many others pale in comparison (including it's successor, New Jack City). I like all of the other movies I mentioned here for comparison purposes, I dare say Scarface I still enjoy more personally. But if you consider yourself a gangster flick fan, watch this film and decide for yourself who is the "king of new york"

    Working with his frequent collaborator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John, NYC based independent filmmaker Abel Ferrara uses the city as the backdrop for a memorably seedy and garishly lit story of cops and hoods, focusing on a veteran crime lord named Frank White (Christopher Walken). Frank's been out of the game for a long time due to a prison stretch, and now he's developed some sense of morality. Assisted by a mostly black crew, he sets about brutally eliminating his rivals, intending to spend the money he makes on improving his neighbourhood. Naturally, there's a team of detectives (among them, characters played by David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo) out to get him. Ferrara, as could be expected, has a great sense of style, nicely capturing the look of his locations. The score by Joe Delia complements the visuals created by a team including cinematographer Bojan Bazelli. Granted, the movie is very grim and gritty stuff, and it may be too violent for some tastes, but it's gripping as hell and the characters are all compulsively watchable. Walken is understated in the lead role, and surrounded by good actors. In fact, there's a lot of familiar faces in the cast. In addition to those mentioned, Laurence Fishburne (displaying a magnetic presence as a drug abusing thug), Janet Julian, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Calderon, Steve Buscemi, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Frank Adonis, Vanessa Angel, Robert LaSardo, James Lorinz, and Harold Perrineau all turn up as well, making this fun to watch. One especially great sequence takes place in the rain during the aftermath of an assault on Whites' compound. The movie begins well and keeps moving fast (it's 104 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it) with one entertaining scene after another, and in the end it packs a pretty hard punch. Highly recommended to fans of crime fiction. Eight out of 10.

    This is most likely Director Ferrara's most accessible Movie. Most of his Films are so quirky, offbeat, and personal with an Art-House/Grindhouse dichotomy that doesn't set to well with casual Movie goers. This one, and perhaps Bad Lieutenant (1992), are Crime Thrillers that call in the masses and give them enough style and grit to garner reluctant approval. But not everyone was entertained. Initially this was a dismissed and protested Movie called trashy, indulgent, and reprehensible. That's what made it the Cult Movie it is today. The over abundance of style and uncompromising, lurid appeal that has a staying power and is unforgettable. There is a metaphorically alluring Character in Frank White (is that name Black Enough For Ya) who is a pale-faced, monstrous, Vampyric Robin Hood as charming as the Devil himself. Like Jesus, he hangs with the dregs, in the bad part of town, but can be found at the Plaza Hotel planning his take down of the worst of the worst. Rival Gangs and crooked, selfish Politicians (Money Changers). This is a Great Neo-Noir that exudes an atmosphere of dark blueness. There is virtually no sunlight in this story of Under Worldliness and it has a nightmarish template of Violence, Decadence, and some Dark Philosophy delivered from a likable chilling Gangster.

    The early 1990s saw a huge resurgence in "gangster movies" ("Goodfellas", "Godfather 3", "New Jack City", "Boys in the Hood", "Mobsters", "Dick Tracy", "Juice", "Clockers", "Dead Presidents", "Menance to Society", "Miller's Crossing" etc etc). One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's "King of New York". The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some. White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg  a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped. Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that "legal methods" aren't "sucessful enough", they thus resort to violent, "extralegal" measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate. Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clich&eacute;s to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood. Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic: lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's "The Terminator" was "King's" chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary. But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an "aesthetic" plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like "Scarface" (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away  "the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort" etc etc  but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only "well dressed" person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest. "King" ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. "I didn't want to make money that way," he says in his epitaph. "And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it." In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment. Upon release, "King" was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its "irresponsibleness", before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works ("R'Xmas", "Last Day on Earth", "New Rose Hotel", "Go Go Tales" etc) and its law/order, wealth/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere "King" indulges in Ferrara's three loves: sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's "Nosferatu's" is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    One Of The Best Gangster Films/Crime Drama Ever Made And An Underrated Classic With an Excellent Performance From Christopher Walken.

    King Of New York is one of the best Gangster Films and Crime Dramas ever made that's filled with stylish direction,Great performances from Christopher Walken and the whole cast,well-written screenplay and great Action. This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved. King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York. King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was "cleaned-up" by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the "Bad Guys" because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the "Good Guys" because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic. The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well. The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara. The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks. In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    How do I sum up this film? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to : (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things. The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever. There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this: Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky. Poor effort - 3/10.

    Abel Ferrara, the director is known for his pitch black flicks. Fear City (1984), Ms 45 (1981), The Driller Killer (1979), who doesn't know this depressive flicks. Here Abel takes the mobster genre to the dark of New York. Although that it never becomes rough or messy there's a bit of blood here and there, but it's really the story that makes you watch King Of New York and not only that, the performances are sublime especially Christopher Walker as the king Frank White who just came out of prison and wants to take New York back in his hands. But the cops look close but can't really take him back to prison so one cop Dennis Gilly (Davis Caruso) takes the rights in his hands and hunts down Frank. But things doesn't work out as it should be. Just look how many well known names are in this flick. And they all do an excellent job. The flick itself doesn't look like a nineties flick because it's rather a slow builder. You can easily qualify this amongst the top ten list of best crime films. Not that many people knew of its existence so you better move to catch yourself a copy, also available on Blu Ray. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets. King of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city's money, or the bent cops that are on his back? In Walken's hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It's a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy ("yo, where the chicken at?" he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters. For anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It's a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara's gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara's finest, and most 'polished' work. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A New York drug lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is being driven in his limousine back into the city following his release from prison. His crew are busy taking out a rival Columbian gang who have been encroaching on White's business while he's been away. Once he's back White wastes no time in taking out more of New York's crime lords and cements himself as the King of New York. Disgruntled that they are never able to get charges to stick, a few wild Police Officers decide that the only way to stop White and his gang is to take them out. Featuring an impressive cast which alongside Walken includes gangsters Laurence Fishburne, Steve Buscemi, Giancarlo Esposito and Theresa Randle with Cops Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo and David Caruso the film is a tale of good vs evil, but as you'd expect the lines between the two are blurred. Although not in the same league as the likes of Scarface, Carlito's Way or Serpico all of which share themes with this, it is a decent gangster picture. The story is fairly basic really. Gang boss gets released from prison; starts to rebuild his empire and the cops try to stop him. There is little new plot wise. The only little twist on the genre is the cop's tactic of halting the gangster's operation. I wasn't really invested in the story or many of the characters though there were some good performances. Much like the plot they were all characters you've seen before to some degree or another. There's the level headed, ice cold killer of a boss, the ostentatious black gangsters, the Irish cops, the Latino middle man, the Mafioso, the Chinese Triads and various scantily clad women. Unfortunately it's all been seen and done before. As I say though there are some terrific performances. Christopher Walken delivers a powerful and menacing performance as Frank White. He's calm and calculating but isn't afraid to deliver the killer blow. The character also has a side to him which makes the audience empathize with him and the way in which Walken creates this is brilliant. Another great performance is Laurence Fishburne as an arrogant and flashy gangster/killer. He is especially good in the chicken shop scene. Victor Argo is also great. The highlight of the film for me was the incredible soundtrack. I have somewhat of a puncheon for late 80s Hip-Hop and this film features some of the best that era had to offer with the likes of Party Posse and Schooly D lending songs. The traditional score which is interspersed with the Hip-Hop works well and sounds good. As well as the soundtrack there was also some pretty jazzy dancing, most notably from Walken. It reminded me of the video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice, a video I could watch over and over again. In addition as the slightly tired plot another problem with the film is the hair. I've never seen such bad hair in a film before. Half the cast sport mullets and Christopher Walken's is characteristically crazy. I did enjoy the two big shoot-outs. They were both action packed and the first must have had some influence on Grand Theft Auto as it looked just like the sort of shoot-out that game would present. In the end King of New York is an average gangster film but nothing more. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    A top gangster called Frank White is released from prison and decides he wants to make a positive social contribution to his New York neighbourhood in the form of a public hospital. He requests help in this enterprise from his fellow gang lords, who refuse to co-operate, leading to a mob war. This gangster film was helmed by maverick director Abel Ferrara who specialises in gritty urban stories set in New York. This is one of his most accessible in many ways  it isn't quite as grim as the likes of The Driller Killer or Bad Lieutenant  but it's still a pretty typical bit of work. This one is all about moral ambiguity. Frank White eliminates his rivals because he doesn't like the ethics of their business practices, yet he still sells drugs on the streets to make money but he wants to use this cash to save a ghetto hospital. It's a film full of shades of grey. No one is good and no one is bad, everyone is in between. The criminals have a conscience, yet continue to commit crimes, while the police hunt these law breakers yet act like just another gang of thugs in doing so. The film is immeasurably helped by excellent acting from Christopher Walken in the central role. It's hardly surprising, seeing as Walken is a fantastic actor who always brings something interesting and compelling to dark roles such as this. There are a lot of great support players too, with good solid turns in particular from Laurence Fishburne and David Caruso. While the hip-hop soundtrack is very effective and adds to the sense of time and place. It's overall a very good crime movie.

    I give the title "King of Gangster Flicks" for many reasons.... no spoilers. First off, I would try to find the DVD release of this film, when I first viewed the movie a few years back it was on VHS and the quality of picture was rather poor (very dark, hard to tell what exactly was going on). With the DVD version it is much more of a pleasurable viewing experience, but only because of the picture quality. This film isn't cute, it doesn't hold back, and it doesn't cater to Hollywood or MTV ideals (Though it was pre-MTV as it is today)... IMO this stands right next to Scarface as it's ugly yankee twin brother .. Cocaine is visible in actor's noses, real-life sounding script w/out catch phrases meant to kickstart a merchandise line, rather unattractive cast and characters that make this movie a real mean flick. Most people confuse this for bad acting and dialogue, but what's meant to be portrayed here is gangsters without the glitter and fame and Hollywood- ization, this movie goes for truth. I had to watch the movie several times to fully digest what was going on as this movie doesn't have training wheels either, it's a straight up cold blooded gangster film that makes many others pale in comparison (including it's successor, New Jack City). I like all of the other movies I mentioned here for comparison purposes, I dare say Scarface I still enjoy more personally. But if you consider yourself a gangster flick fan, watch this film and decide for yourself who is the "king of new york"

    Working with his frequent collaborator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John, NYC based independent filmmaker Abel Ferrara uses the city as the backdrop for a memorably seedy and garishly lit story of cops and hoods, focusing on a veteran crime lord named Frank White (Christopher Walken). Frank's been out of the game for a long time due to a prison stretch, and now he's developed some sense of morality. Assisted by a mostly black crew, he sets about brutally eliminating his rivals, intending to spend the money he makes on improving his neighbourhood. Naturally, there's a team of detectives (among them, characters played by David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo) out to get him. Ferrara, as could be expected, has a great sense of style, nicely capturing the look of his locations. The score by Joe Delia complements the visuals created by a team including cinematographer Bojan Bazelli. Granted, the movie is very grim and gritty stuff, and it may be too violent for some tastes, but it's gripping as hell and the characters are all compulsively watchable. Walken is understated in the lead role, and surrounded by good actors. In fact, there's a lot of familiar faces in the cast. In addition to those mentioned, Laurence Fishburne (displaying a magnetic presence as a drug abusing thug), Janet Julian, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Calderon, Steve Buscemi, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Frank Adonis, Vanessa Angel, Robert LaSardo, James Lorinz, and Harold Perrineau all turn up as well, making this fun to watch. One especially great sequence takes place in the rain during the aftermath of an assault on Whites' compound. The movie begins well and keeps moving fast (it's 104 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it) with one entertaining scene after another, and in the end it packs a pretty hard punch. Highly recommended to fans of crime fiction. Eight out of 10.

    This is most likely Director Ferrara's most accessible Movie. Most of his Films are so quirky, offbeat, and personal with an Art-House/Grindhouse dichotomy that doesn't set to well with casual Movie goers. This one, and perhaps Bad Lieutenant (1992), are Crime Thrillers that call in the masses and give them enough style and grit to garner reluctant approval. But not everyone was entertained. Initially this was a dismissed and protested Movie called trashy, indulgent, and reprehensible. That's what made it the Cult Movie it is today. The over abundance of style and uncompromising, lurid appeal that has a staying power and is unforgettable. There is a metaphorically alluring Character in Frank White (is that name Black Enough For Ya) who is a pale-faced, monstrous, Vampyric Robin Hood as charming as the Devil himself. Like Jesus, he hangs with the dregs, in the bad part of town, but can be found at the Plaza Hotel planning his take down of the worst of the worst. Rival Gangs and crooked, selfish Politicians (Money Changers). This is a Great Neo-Noir that exudes an atmosphere of dark blueness. There is virtually no sunlight in this story of Under Worldliness and it has a nightmarish template of Violence, Decadence, and some Dark Philosophy delivered from a likable chilling Gangster.

    The early 1990s saw a huge resurgence in "gangster movies" ("Goodfellas", "Godfather 3", "New Jack City", "Boys in the Hood", "Mobsters", "Dick Tracy", "Juice", "Clockers", "Dead Presidents", "Menance to Society", "Miller's Crossing" etc etc). One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's "King of New York". The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some. White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg  a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped. Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that "legal methods" aren't "sucessful enough", they thus resort to violent, "extralegal" measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate. Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clich&eacute;s to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood. Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic: lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's "The Terminator" was "King's" chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary. But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an "aesthetic" plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like "Scarface" (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away  "the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort" etc etc  but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only "well dressed" person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest. "King" ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. "I didn't want to make money that way," he says in his epitaph. "And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it." In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment. Upon release, "King" was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its "irresponsibleness", before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works ("R'Xmas", "Last Day on Earth", "New Rose Hotel", "Go Go Tales" etc) and its law/order, wealth/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere "King" indulges in Ferrara's three loves: sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's "Nosferatu's" is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    One Of The Best Gangster Films/Crime Drama Ever Made And An Underrated Classic With an Excellent Performance From Christopher Walken.

    King Of New York is one of the best Gangster Films and Crime Dramas ever made that's filled with stylish direction,Great performances from Christopher Walken and the whole cast,well-written screenplay and great Action. This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved. King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York. King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was "cleaned-up" by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the "Bad Guys" because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the "Good Guys" because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic. The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well. The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara. The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks. In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    How do I sum up this film? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to : (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things. The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever. There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this: Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky. Poor effort - 3/10.

    Abel Ferrara, the director is known for his pitch black flicks. Fear City (1984), Ms 45 (1981), The Driller Killer (1979), who doesn't know this depressive flicks. Here Abel takes the mobster genre to the dark of New York. Although that it never becomes rough or messy there's a bit of blood here and there, but it's really the story that makes you watch King Of New York and not only that, the performances are sublime especially Christopher Walker as the king Frank White who just came out of prison and wants to take New York back in his hands. But the cops look close but can't really take him back to prison so one cop Dennis Gilly (Davis Caruso) takes the rights in his hands and hunts down Frank. But things doesn't work out as it should be. Just look how many well known names are in this flick. And they all do an excellent job. The flick itself doesn't look like a nineties flick because it's rather a slow builder. You can easily qualify this amongst the top ten list of best crime films. Not that many people knew of its existence so you better move to catch yourself a copy, also available on Blu Ray. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets. King of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city's money, or the bent cops that are on his back? In Walken's hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It's a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy ("yo, where the chicken at?" he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters. For anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It's a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara's gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara's finest, and most 'polished' work. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A New York drug lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is being driven in his limousine back into the city following his release from prison. His crew are busy taking out a rival Columbian gang who have been encroaching on White's business while he's been away. Once he's back White wastes no time in taking out more of New York's crime lords and cements himself as the King of New York. Disgruntled that they are never able to get charges to stick, a few wild Police Officers decide that the only way to stop White and his gang is to take them out. Featuring an impressive cast which alongside Walken includes gangsters Laurence Fishburne, Steve Buscemi, Giancarlo Esposito and Theresa Randle with Cops Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo and David Caruso the film is a tale of good vs evil, but as you'd expect the lines between the two are blurred. Although not in the same league as the likes of Scarface, Carlito's Way or Serpico all of which share themes with this, it is a decent gangster picture. The story is fairly basic really. Gang boss gets released from prison; starts to rebuild his empire and the cops try to stop him. There is little new plot wise. The only little twist on the genre is the cop's tactic of halting the gangster's operation. I wasn't really invested in the story or many of the characters though there were some good performances. Much like the plot they were all characters you've seen before to some degree or another. There's the level headed, ice cold killer of a boss, the ostentatious black gangsters, the Irish cops, the Latino middle man, the Mafioso, the Chinese Triads and various scantily clad women. Unfortunately it's all been seen and done before. As I say though there are some terrific performances. Christopher Walken delivers a powerful and menacing performance as Frank White. He's calm and calculating but isn't afraid to deliver the killer blow. The character also has a side to him which makes the audience empathize with him and the way in which Walken creates this is brilliant. Another great performance is Laurence Fishburne as an arrogant and flashy gangster/killer. He is especially good in the chicken shop scene. Victor Argo is also great. The highlight of the film for me was the incredible soundtrack. I have somewhat of a puncheon for late 80s Hip-Hop and this film features some of the best that era had to offer with the likes of Party Posse and Schooly D lending songs. The traditional score which is interspersed with the Hip-Hop works well and sounds good. As well as the soundtrack there was also some pretty jazzy dancing, most notably from Walken. It reminded me of the video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice, a video I could watch over and over again. In addition as the slightly tired plot another problem with the film is the hair. I've never seen such bad hair in a film before. Half the cast sport mullets and Christopher Walken's is characteristically crazy. I did enjoy the two big shoot-outs. They were both action packed and the first must have had some influence on Grand Theft Auto as it looked just like the sort of shoot-out that game would present. In the end King of New York is an average gangster film but nothing more. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    A top gangster called Frank White is released from prison and decides he wants to make a positive social contribution to his New York neighbourhood in the form of a public hospital. He requests help in this enterprise from his fellow gang lords, who refuse to co-operate, leading to a mob war. This gangster film was helmed by maverick director Abel Ferrara who specialises in gritty urban stories set in New York. This is one of his most accessible in many ways  it isn't quite as grim as the likes of The Driller Killer or Bad Lieutenant  but it's still a pretty typical bit of work. This one is all about moral ambiguity. Frank White eliminates his rivals because he doesn't like the ethics of their business practices, yet he still sells drugs on the streets to make money but he wants to use this cash to save a ghetto hospital. It's a film full of shades of grey. No one is good and no one is bad, everyone is in between. The criminals have a conscience, yet continue to commit crimes, while the police hunt these law breakers yet act like just another gang of thugs in doing so. The film is immeasurably helped by excellent acting from Christopher Walken in the central role. It's hardly surprising, seeing as Walken is a fantastic actor who always brings something interesting and compelling to dark roles such as this. There are a lot of great support players too, with good solid turns in particular from Laurence Fishburne and David Caruso. While the hip-hop soundtrack is very effective and adds to the sense of time and place. It's overall a very good crime movie.

    I give the title "King of Gangster Flicks" for many reasons.... no spoilers. First off, I would try to find the DVD release of this film, when I first viewed the movie a few years back it was on VHS and the quality of picture was rather poor (very dark, hard to tell what exactly was going on). With the DVD version it is much more of a pleasurable viewing experience, but only because of the picture quality. This film isn't cute, it doesn't hold back, and it doesn't cater to Hollywood or MTV ideals (Though it was pre-MTV as it is today)... IMO this stands right next to Scarface as it's ugly yankee twin brother .. Cocaine is visible in actor's noses, real-life sounding script w/out catch phrases meant to kickstart a merchandise line, rather unattractive cast and characters that make this movie a real mean flick. Most people confuse this for bad acting and dialogue, but what's meant to be portrayed here is gangsters without the glitter and fame and Hollywood- ization, this movie goes for truth. I had to watch the movie several times to fully digest what was going on as this movie doesn't have training wheels either, it's a straight up cold blooded gangster film that makes many others pale in comparison (including it's successor, New Jack City). I like all of the other movies I mentioned here for comparison purposes, I dare say Scarface I still enjoy more personally. But if you consider yourself a gangster flick fan, watch this film and decide for yourself who is the "king of new york"

    Working with his frequent collaborator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John, NYC based independent filmmaker Abel Ferrara uses the city as the backdrop for a memorably seedy and garishly lit story of cops and hoods, focusing on a veteran crime lord named Frank White (Christopher Walken). Frank's been out of the game for a long time due to a prison stretch, and now he's developed some sense of morality. Assisted by a mostly black crew, he sets about brutally eliminating his rivals, intending to spend the money he makes on improving his neighbourhood. Naturally, there's a team of detectives (among them, characters played by David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo) out to get him. Ferrara, as could be expected, has a great sense of style, nicely capturing the look of his locations. The score by Joe Delia complements the visuals created by a team including cinematographer Bojan Bazelli. Granted, the movie is very grim and gritty stuff, and it may be too violent for some tastes, but it's gripping as hell and the characters are all compulsively watchable. Walken is understated in the lead role, and surrounded by good actors. In fact, there's a lot of familiar faces in the cast. In addition to those mentioned, Laurence Fishburne (displaying a magnetic presence as a drug abusing thug), Janet Julian, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Calderon, Steve Buscemi, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Frank Adonis, Vanessa Angel, Robert LaSardo, James Lorinz, and Harold Perrineau all turn up as well, making this fun to watch. One especially great sequence takes place in the rain during the aftermath of an assault on Whites' compound. The movie begins well and keeps moving fast (it's 104 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it) with one entertaining scene after another, and in the end it packs a pretty hard punch. Highly recommended to fans of crime fiction. Eight out of 10.

    This is most likely Director Ferrara's most accessible Movie. Most of his Films are so quirky, offbeat, and personal with an Art-House/Grindhouse dichotomy that doesn't set to well with casual Movie goers. This one, and perhaps Bad Lieutenant (1992), are Crime Thrillers that call in the masses and give them enough style and grit to garner reluctant approval. But not everyone was entertained. Initially this was a dismissed and protested Movie called trashy, indulgent, and reprehensible. That's what made it the Cult Movie it is today. The over abundance of style and uncompromising, lurid appeal that has a staying power and is unforgettable. There is a metaphorically alluring Character in Frank White (is that name Black Enough For Ya) who is a pale-faced, monstrous, Vampyric Robin Hood as charming as the Devil himself. Like Jesus, he hangs with the dregs, in the bad part of town, but can be found at the Plaza Hotel planning his take down of the worst of the worst. Rival Gangs and crooked, selfish Politicians (Money Changers). This is a Great Neo-Noir that exudes an atmosphere of dark blueness. There is virtually no sunlight in this story of Under Worldliness and it has a nightmarish template of Violence, Decadence, and some Dark Philosophy delivered from a likable chilling Gangster.

    The early 1990s saw a huge resurgence in "gangster movies" ("Goodfellas", "Godfather 3", "New Jack City", "Boys in the Hood", "Mobsters", "Dick Tracy", "Juice", "Clockers", "Dead Presidents", "Menance to Society", "Miller's Crossing" etc etc). One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's "King of New York". The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some. White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg  a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped. Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that "legal methods" aren't "sucessful enough", they thus resort to violent, "extralegal" measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate. Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clich&eacute;s to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood. Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic: lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's "The Terminator" was "King's" chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary. But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an "aesthetic" plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like "Scarface" (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away  "the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort" etc etc  but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only "well dressed" person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest. "King" ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. "I didn't want to make money that way," he says in his epitaph. "And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it." In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment. Upon release, "King" was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its "irresponsibleness", before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works ("R'Xmas", "Last Day on Earth", "New Rose Hotel", "Go Go Tales" etc) and its law/order, wealth/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere "King" indulges in Ferrara's three loves: sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's "Nosferatu's" is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    One Of The Best Gangster Films/Crime Drama Ever Made And An Underrated Classic With an Excellent Performance From Christopher Walken.

    King Of New York is one of the best Gangster Films and Crime Dramas ever made that's filled with stylish direction,Great performances from Christopher Walken and the whole cast,well-written screenplay and great Action. This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved. King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York. King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was "cleaned-up" by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the "Bad Guys" because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the "Good Guys" because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic. The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well. The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara. The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks. In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    How do I sum up this film? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to : (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things. The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever. There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this: Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky. Poor effort - 3/10.

    Abel Ferrara, the director is known for his pitch black flicks. Fear City (1984), Ms 45 (1981), The Driller Killer (1979), who doesn't know this depressive flicks. Here Abel takes the mobster genre to the dark of New York. Although that it never becomes rough or messy there's a bit of blood here and there, but it's really the story that makes you watch King Of New York and not only that, the performances are sublime especially Christopher Walker as the king Frank White who just came out of prison and wants to take New York back in his hands. But the cops look close but can't really take him back to prison so one cop Dennis Gilly (Davis Caruso) takes the rights in his hands and hunts down Frank. But things doesn't work out as it should be. Just look how many well known names are in this flick. And they all do an excellent job. The flick itself doesn't look like a nineties flick because it's rather a slow builder. You can easily qualify this amongst the top ten list of best crime films. Not that many people knew of its existence so you better move to catch yourself a copy, also available on Blu Ray. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets. King of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city's money, or the bent cops that are on his back? In Walken's hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It's a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy ("yo, where the chicken at?" he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters. For anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It's a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara's gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara's finest, and most 'polished' work. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A New York drug lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is being driven in his limousine back into the city following his release from prison. His crew are busy taking out a rival Columbian gang who have been encroaching on White's business while he's been away. Once he's back White wastes no time in taking out more of New York's crime lords and cements himself as the King of New York. Disgruntled that they are never able to get charges to stick, a few wild Police Officers decide that the only way to stop White and his gang is to take them out. Featuring an impressive cast which alongside Walken includes gangsters Laurence Fishburne, Steve Buscemi, Giancarlo Esposito and Theresa Randle with Cops Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo and David Caruso the film is a tale of good vs evil, but as you'd expect the lines between the two are blurred. Although not in the same league as the likes of Scarface, Carlito's Way or Serpico all of which share themes with this, it is a decent gangster picture. The story is fairly basic really. Gang boss gets released from prison; starts to rebuild his empire and the cops try to stop him. There is little new plot wise. The only little twist on the genre is the cop's tactic of halting the gangster's operation. I wasn't really invested in the story or many of the characters though there were some good performances. Much like the plot they were all characters you've seen before to some degree or another. There's the level headed, ice cold killer of a boss, the ostentatious black gangsters, the Irish cops, the Latino middle man, the Mafioso, the Chinese Triads and various scantily clad women. Unfortunately it's all been seen and done before. As I say though there are some terrific performances. Christopher Walken delivers a powerful and menacing performance as Frank White. He's calm and calculating but isn't afraid to deliver the killer blow. The character also has a side to him which makes the audience empathize with him and the way in which Walken creates this is brilliant. Another great performance is Laurence Fishburne as an arrogant and flashy gangster/killer. He is especially good in the chicken shop scene. Victor Argo is also great. The highlight of the film for me was the incredible soundtrack. I have somewhat of a puncheon for late 80s Hip-Hop and this film features some of the best that era had to offer with the likes of Party Posse and Schooly D lending songs. The traditional score which is interspersed with the Hip-Hop works well and sounds good. As well as the soundtrack there was also some pretty jazzy dancing, most notably from Walken. It reminded me of the video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice, a video I could watch over and over again. In addition as the slightly tired plot another problem with the film is the hair. I've never seen such bad hair in a film before. Half the cast sport mullets and Christopher Walken's is characteristically crazy. I did enjoy the two big shoot-outs. They were both action packed and the first must have had some influence on Grand Theft Auto as it looked just like the sort of shoot-out that game would present. In the end King of New York is an average gangster film but nothing more. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    A top gangster called Frank White is released from prison and decides he wants to make a positive social contribution to his New York neighbourhood in the form of a public hospital. He requests help in this enterprise from his fellow gang lords, who refuse to co-operate, leading to a mob war. This gangster film was helmed by maverick director Abel Ferrara who specialises in gritty urban stories set in New York. This is one of his most accessible in many ways  it isn't quite as grim as the likes of The Driller Killer or Bad Lieutenant  but it's still a pretty typical bit of work. This one is all about moral ambiguity. Frank White eliminates his rivals because he doesn't like the ethics of their business practices, yet he still sells drugs on the streets to make money but he wants to use this cash to save a ghetto hospital. It's a film full of shades of grey. No one is good and no one is bad, everyone is in between. The criminals have a conscience, yet continue to commit crimes, while the police hunt these law breakers yet act like just another gang of thugs in doing so. The film is immeasurably helped by excellent acting from Christopher Walken in the central role. It's hardly surprising, seeing as Walken is a fantastic actor who always brings something interesting and compelling to dark roles such as this. There are a lot of great support players too, with good solid turns in particular from Laurence Fishburne and David Caruso. While the hip-hop soundtrack is very effective and adds to the sense of time and place. It's overall a very good crime movie.

    I give the title "King of Gangster Flicks" for many reasons.... no spoilers. First off, I would try to find the DVD release of this film, when I first viewed the movie a few years back it was on VHS and the quality of picture was rather poor (very dark, hard to tell what exactly was going on). With the DVD version it is much more of a pleasurable viewing experience, but only because of the picture quality. This film isn't cute, it doesn't hold back, and it doesn't cater to Hollywood or MTV ideals (Though it was pre-MTV as it is today)... IMO this stands right next to Scarface as it's ugly yankee twin brother .. Cocaine is visible in actor's noses, real-life sounding script w/out catch phrases meant to kickstart a merchandise line, rather unattractive cast and characters that make this movie a real mean flick. Most people confuse this for bad acting and dialogue, but what's meant to be portrayed here is gangsters without the glitter and fame and Hollywood- ization, this movie goes for truth. I had to watch the movie several times to fully digest what was going on as this movie doesn't have training wheels either, it's a straight up cold blooded gangster film that makes many others pale in comparison (including it's successor, New Jack City).

In addition to those mentioned, Laurence Fishburne (displaying a magnetic presence as a drug abusing thug), Janet Julian, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Calderon, Steve Buscemi, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Frank Adonis, Vanessa Angel, Robert LaSardo, James Lorinz, and Harold Perrineau all turn up as well, making this fun to watch. One especially great sequence takes place in the rain during the aftermath of an assault on Whites' compound. The movie begins well and keeps moving fast (it's 104 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it) with one entertaining scene after another, and in the end it packs a pretty hard punch. Highly recommended to fans of crime fiction. Eight out of 10.

    This is most likely Director Ferrara's most accessible Movie. Most of his Films are so quirky, offbeat, and personal with an Art-House/Grindhouse dichotomy that doesn't set to well with casual Movie goers. This one, and perhaps Bad Lieutenant (1992), are Crime Thrillers that call in the masses and give them enough style and grit to garner reluctant approval. But not everyone was entertained. Initially this was a dismissed and protested Movie called trashy, indulgent, and reprehensible. That's what made it the Cult Movie it is today. The over abundance of style and uncompromising, lurid appeal that has a staying power and is unforgettable. There is a metaphorically alluring Character in Frank White (is that name Black Enough For Ya) who is a pale-faced, monstrous, Vampyric Robin Hood as charming as the Devil himself. Like Jesus, he hangs with the dregs, in the bad part of town, but can be found at the Plaza Hotel planning his take down of the worst of the worst. Rival Gangs and crooked, selfish Politicians (Money Changers). This is a Great Neo-Noir that exudes an atmosphere of dark blueness. There is virtually no sunlight in this story of Under Worldliness and it has a nightmarish template of Violence, Decadence, and some Dark Philosophy delivered from a likable chilling Gangster.

    The early 1990s saw a huge resurgence in "gangster movies" ("Goodfellas", "Godfather 3", "New Jack City", "Boys in the Hood", "Mobsters", "Dick Tracy", "Juice", "Clockers", "Dead Presidents", "Menance to Society", "Miller's Crossing" etc etc). One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's "King of New York". The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some. White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg  a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped. Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that "legal methods" aren't "sucessful enough", they thus resort to violent, "extralegal" measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate. Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clich&eacute;s to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood. Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic: lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's "The Terminator" was "King's" chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary. But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an "aesthetic" plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like "Scarface" (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away  "the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort" etc etc  but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only "well dressed" person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest. "King" ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. "I didn't want to make money that way," he says in his epitaph. "And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it." In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment. Upon release, "King" was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its "irresponsibleness", before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works ("R'Xmas", "Last Day on Earth", "New Rose Hotel", "Go Go Tales" etc) and its law/order, wealth/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere "King" indulges in Ferrara's three loves: sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's "Nosferatu's" is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    One Of The Best Gangster Films/Crime Drama Ever Made And An Underrated Classic With an Excellent Performance From Christopher Walken.

    King Of New York is one of the best Gangster Films and Crime Dramas ever made that's filled with stylish direction,Great performances from Christopher Walken and the whole cast,well-written screenplay and great Action. This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved. King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York. King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was "cleaned-up" by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the "Bad Guys" because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the "Good Guys" because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic. The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well. The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara. The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks. In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    How do I sum up this film? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to : (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things. The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever. There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this: Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky. Poor effort - 3/10.

    Abel Ferrara, the director is known for his pitch black flicks. Fear City (1984), Ms 45 (1981), The Driller Killer (1979), who doesn't know this depressive flicks. Here Abel takes the mobster genre to the dark of New York. Although that it never becomes rough or messy there's a bit of blood here and there, but it's really the story that makes you watch King Of New York and not only that, the performances are sublime especially Christopher Walker as the king Frank White who just came out of prison and wants to take New York back in his hands. But the cops look close but can't really take him back to prison so one cop Dennis Gilly (Davis Caruso) takes the rights in his hands and hunts down Frank. But things doesn't work out as it should be. Just look how many well known names are in this flick. And they all do an excellent job. The flick itself doesn't look like a nineties flick because it's rather a slow builder. You can easily qualify this amongst the top ten list of best crime films. Not that many people knew of its existence so you better move to catch yourself a copy, also available on Blu Ray. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets. King of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city's money, or the bent cops that are on his back? In Walken's hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It's a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy ("yo, where the chicken at?" he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters. For anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It's a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara's gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara's finest, and most 'polished' work. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A New York drug lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is being driven in his limousine back into the city following his release from prison. His crew are busy taking out a rival Columbian gang who have been encroaching on White's business while he's been away. Once he's back White wastes no time in taking out more of New York's crime lords and cements himself as the King of New York. Disgruntled that they are never able to get charges to stick, a few wild Police Officers decide that the only way to stop White and his gang is to take them out. Featuring an impressive cast which alongside Walken includes gangsters Laurence Fishburne, Steve Buscemi, Giancarlo Esposito and Theresa Randle with Cops Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo and David Caruso the film is a tale of good vs evil, but as you'd expect the lines between the two are blurred. Although not in the same league as the likes of Scarface, Carlito's Way or Serpico all of which share themes with this, it is a decent gangster picture. The story is fairly basic really. Gang boss gets released from prison; starts to rebuild his empire and the cops try to stop him. There is little new plot wise. The only little twist on the genre is the cop's tactic of halting the gangster's operation. I wasn't really invested in the story or many of the characters though there were some good performances. Much like the plot they were all characters you've seen before to some degree or another. There's the level headed, ice cold killer of a boss, the ostentatious black gangsters, the Irish cops, the Latino middle man, the Mafioso, the Chinese Triads and various scantily clad women. Unfortunately it's all been seen and done before. As I say though there are some terrific performances. Christopher Walken delivers a powerful and menacing performance as Frank White. He's calm and calculating but isn't afraid to deliver the killer blow. The character also has a side to him which makes the audience empathize with him and the way in which Walken creates this is brilliant. Another great performance is Laurence Fishburne as an arrogant and flashy gangster/killer. He is especially good in the chicken shop scene. Victor Argo is also great. The highlight of the film for me was the incredible soundtrack. I have somewhat of a puncheon for late 80s Hip-Hop and this film features some of the best that era had to offer with the likes of Party Posse and Schooly D lending songs. The traditional score which is interspersed with the Hip-Hop works well and sounds good. As well as the soundtrack there was also some pretty jazzy dancing, most notably from Walken. It reminded me of the video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice, a video I could watch over and over again. In addition as the slightly tired plot another problem with the film is the hair. I've never seen such bad hair in a film before. Half the cast sport mullets and Christopher Walken's is characteristically crazy. I did enjoy the two big shoot-outs. They were both action packed and the first must have had some influence on Grand Theft Auto as it looked just like the sort of shoot-out that game would present. In the end King of New York is an average gangster film but nothing more. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    A top gangster called Frank White is released from prison and decides he wants to make a positive social contribution to his New York neighbourhood in the form of a public hospital. He requests help in this enterprise from his fellow gang lords, who refuse to co-operate, leading to a mob war. This gangster film was helmed by maverick director Abel Ferrara who specialises in gritty urban stories set in New York. This is one of his most accessible in many ways  it isn't quite as grim as the likes of The Driller Killer or Bad Lieutenant  but it's still a pretty typical bit of work. This one is all about moral ambiguity. Frank White eliminates his rivals because he doesn't like the ethics of their business practices, yet he still sells drugs on the streets to make money but he wants to use this cash to save a ghetto hospital. It's a film full of shades of grey. No one is good and no one is bad, everyone is in between. The criminals have a conscience, yet continue to commit crimes, while the police hunt these law breakers yet act like just another gang of thugs in doing so. The film is immeasurably helped by excellent acting from Christopher Walken in the central role. It's hardly surprising, seeing as Walken is a fantastic actor who always brings something interesting and compelling to dark roles such as this. There are a lot of great support players too, with good solid turns in particular from Laurence Fishburne and David Caruso. While the hip-hop soundtrack is very effective and adds to the sense of time and place. It's overall a very good crime movie.

    I give the title "King of Gangster Flicks" for many reasons.... no spoilers. First off, I would try to find the DVD release of this film, when I first viewed the movie a few years back it was on VHS and the quality of picture was rather poor (very dark, hard to tell what exactly was going on). With the DVD version it is much more of a pleasurable viewing experience, but only because of the picture quality. This film isn't cute, it doesn't hold back, and it doesn't cater to Hollywood or MTV ideals (Though it was pre-MTV as it is today)... IMO this stands right next to Scarface as it's ugly yankee twin brother .. Cocaine is visible in actor's noses, real-life sounding script w/out catch phrases meant to kickstart a merchandise line, rather unattractive cast and characters that make this movie a real mean flick. Most people confuse this for bad acting and dialogue, but what's meant to be portrayed here is gangsters without the glitter and fame and Hollywood- ization, this movie goes for truth. I had to watch the movie several times to fully digest what was going on as this movie doesn't have training wheels either, it's a straight up cold blooded gangster film that makes many others pale in comparison (including it's successor, New Jack City). I like all of the other movies I mentioned here for comparison purposes, I dare say Scarface I still enjoy more personally. But if you consider yourself a gangster flick fan, watch this film and decide for yourself who is the "king of new york"

    Working with his frequent collaborator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John, NYC based independent filmmaker Abel Ferrara uses the city as the backdrop for a memorably seedy and garishly lit story of cops and hoods, focusing on a veteran crime lord named Frank White (Christopher Walken). Frank's been out of the game for a long time due to a prison stretch, and now he's developed some sense of morality. Assisted by a mostly black crew, he sets about brutally eliminating his rivals, intending to spend the money he makes on improving his neighbourhood. Naturally, there's a team of detectives (among them, characters played by David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo) out to get him. Ferrara, as could be expected, has a great sense of style, nicely capturing the look of his locations. The score by Joe Delia complements the visuals created by a team including cinematographer Bojan Bazelli. Granted, the movie is very grim and gritty stuff, and it may be too violent for some tastes, but it's gripping as hell and the characters are all compulsively watchable. Walken is understated in the lead role, and surrounded by good actors. In fact, there's a lot of familiar faces in the cast. In addition to those mentioned, Laurence Fishburne (displaying a magnetic presence as a drug abusing thug), Janet Julian, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Calderon, Steve Buscemi, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Frank Adonis, Vanessa Angel, Robert LaSardo, James Lorinz, and Harold Perrineau all turn up as well, making this fun to watch. One especially great sequence takes place in the rain during the aftermath of an assault on Whites' compound. The movie begins well and keeps moving fast (it's 104 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it) with one entertaining scene after another, and in the end it packs a pretty hard punch. Highly recommended to fans of crime fiction. Eight out of 10.

    This is most likely Director Ferrara's most accessible Movie. Most of his Films are so quirky, offbeat, and personal with an Art-House/Grindhouse dichotomy that doesn't set to well with casual Movie goers. This one, and perhaps Bad Lieutenant (1992), are Crime Thrillers that call in the masses and give them enough style and grit to garner reluctant approval. But not everyone was entertained. Initially this was a dismissed and protested Movie called trashy, indulgent, and reprehensible. That's what made it the Cult Movie it is today. The over abundance of style and uncompromising, lurid appeal that has a staying power and is unforgettable. There is a metaphorically alluring Character in Frank White (is that name Black Enough For Ya) who is a pale-faced, monstrous, Vampyric Robin Hood as charming as the Devil himself. Like Jesus, he hangs with the dregs, in the bad part of town, but can be found at the Plaza Hotel planning his take down of the worst of the worst. Rival Gangs and crooked, selfish Politicians (Money Changers). This is a Great Neo-Noir that exudes an atmosphere of dark blueness.

    The early 1990s saw a huge resurgence in "gangster movies" ("Goodfellas", "Godfather 3", "New Jack City", "Boys in the Hood", "Mobsters", "Dick Tracy", "Juice", "Clockers", "Dead Presidents", "Menance to Society", "Miller's Crossing" etc etc). One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's "King of New York". The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some. White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg  a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped. Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that "legal methods" aren't "sucessful enough", they thus resort to violent, "extralegal" measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate. Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clich&eacute;s to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood. Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic: lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's "The Terminator" was "King's" chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary. But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an "aesthetic" plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like "Scarface" (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away  "the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort" etc etc  but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only "well dressed" person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest. "King" ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. "I didn't want to make money that way," he says in his epitaph. "And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it." In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment. Upon release, "King" was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its "irresponsibleness", before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works ("R'Xmas", "Last Day on Earth", "New Rose Hotel", "Go Go Tales" etc) and its law/order, wealth/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere "King" indulges in Ferrara's three loves: sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's "Nosferatu's" is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    King Of New York is one of the best Gangster Films and Crime Dramas ever made that's filled with stylish direction,Great performances from Christopher Walken and the whole cast,well-written screenplay and great Action. This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved. King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York. King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was "cleaned-up" by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the "Bad Guys" because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the "Good Guys" because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic. The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well. The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara. The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks. In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    How do I sum up this film? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to : (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things. The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever. There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this: Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky. Poor effort - 3/10.

    Abel Ferrara, the director is known for his pitch black flicks. Fear City (1984), Ms 45 (1981), The Driller Killer (1979), who doesn't know this depressive flicks. Here Abel takes the mobster genre to the dark of New York. Although that it never becomes rough or messy there's a bit of blood here and there, but it's really the story that makes you watch King Of New York and not only that, the performances are sublime especially Christopher Walker as the king Frank White who just came out of prison and wants to take New York back in his hands. But the cops look close but can't really take him back to prison so one cop Dennis Gilly (Davis Caruso) takes the rights in his hands and hunts down Frank. But things doesn't work out as it should be. Just look how many well known names are in this flick. And they all do an excellent job. The flick itself doesn't look like a nineties flick because it's rather a slow builder. You can easily qualify this amongst the top ten list of best crime films. Not that many people knew of its existence so you better move to catch yourself a copy, also available on Blu Ray. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets. King of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city's money, or the bent cops that are on his back? In Walken's hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It's a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy ("yo, where the chicken at?" he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters. For anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It's a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara's gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara's finest, and most 'polished' work. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A New York drug lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is being driven in his limousine back into the city following his release from prison. His crew are busy taking out a rival Columbian gang who have been encroaching on White's business while he's been away. Once he's back White wastes no time in taking out more of New York's crime lords and cements himself as the King of New York. Disgruntled that they are never able to get charges to stick, a few wild Police Officers decide that the only way to stop White and his gang is to take them out. Featuring an impressive cast which alongside Walken includes gangsters Laurence Fishburne, Steve Buscemi, Giancarlo Esposito and Theresa Randle with Cops Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo and David Caruso the film is a tale of good vs evil, but as you'd expect the lines between the two are blurred. Although not in the same league as the likes of Scarface, Carlito's Way or Serpico all of which share themes with this, it is a decent gangster picture. The story is fairly basic really. Gang boss gets released from prison; starts to rebuild his empire and the cops try to stop him. There is little new plot wise. The only little twist on the genre is the cop's tactic of halting the gangster's operation. I wasn't really invested in the story or many of the characters though there were some good performances. Much like the plot they were all characters you've seen before to some degree or another. There's the level headed, ice cold killer of a boss, the ostentatious black gangsters, the Irish cops, the Latino middle man, the Mafioso, the Chinese Triads and various scantily clad women. Unfortunately it's all been seen and done before. As I say though there are some terrific performances. Christopher Walken delivers a powerful and menacing performance as Frank White. He's calm and calculating but isn't afraid to deliver the killer blow. The character also has a side to him which makes the audience empathize with him and the way in which Walken creates this is brilliant. Another great performance is Laurence Fishburne as an arrogant and flashy gangster/killer. He is especially good in the chicken shop scene. Victor Argo is also great. The highlight of the film for me was the incredible soundtrack. I have somewhat of a puncheon for late 80s Hip-Hop and this film features some of the best that era had to offer with the likes of Party Posse and Schooly D lending songs. The traditional score which is interspersed with the Hip-Hop works well and sounds good. As well as the soundtrack there was also some pretty jazzy dancing, most notably from Walken. It reminded me of the video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice, a video I could watch over and over again. In addition as the slightly tired plot another problem with the film is the hair. I've never seen such bad hair in a film before. Half the cast sport mullets and Christopher Walken's is characteristically crazy. I did enjoy the two big shoot-outs. They were both action packed and the first must have had some influence on Grand Theft Auto as it looked just like the sort of shoot-out that game would present. In the end King of New York is an average gangster film but nothing more. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    A top gangster called Frank White is released from prison and decides he wants to make a positive social contribution to his New York neighbourhood in the form of a public hospital. He requests help in this enterprise from his fellow gang lords, who refuse to co-operate, leading to a mob war. This gangster film was helmed by maverick director Abel Ferrara who specialises in gritty urban stories set in New York. This is one of his most accessible in many ways  it isn't quite as grim as the likes of The Driller Killer or Bad Lieutenant  but it's still a pretty typical bit of work. This one is all about moral ambiguity. Frank White eliminates his rivals because he doesn't like the ethics of their business practices, yet he still sells drugs on the streets to make money but he wants to use this cash to save a ghetto hospital. It's a film full of shades of grey. No one is good and no one is bad, everyone is in between. The criminals have a conscience, yet continue to commit crimes, while the police hunt these law breakers yet act like just another gang of thugs in doing so. The film is immeasurably helped by excellent acting from Christopher Walken in the central role. It's hardly surprising, seeing as Walken is a fantastic actor who always brings something interesting and compelling to dark roles such as this. There are a lot of great support players too, with good solid turns in particular from Laurence Fishburne and David Caruso. While the hip-hop soundtrack is very effective and adds to the sense of time and place. It's overall a very good crime movie.

    I give the title "King of Gangster Flicks" for many reasons.... no spoilers. First off, I would try to find the DVD release of this film, when I first viewed the movie a few years back it was on VHS and the quality of picture was rather poor (very dark, hard to tell what exactly was going on). With the DVD version it is much more of a pleasurable viewing experience, but only because of the picture quality. This film isn't cute, it doesn't hold back, and it doesn't cater to Hollywood or MTV ideals (Though it was pre-MTV as it is today)... IMO this stands right next to Scarface as it's ugly yankee twin brother .. Cocaine is visible in actor's noses, real-life sounding script w/out catch phrases meant to kickstart a merchandise line, rather unattractive cast and characters that make this movie a real mean flick. Most people confuse this for bad acting and dialogue, but what's meant to be portrayed here is gangsters without the glitter and fame and Hollywood- ization, this movie goes for truth. I had to watch the movie several times to fully digest what was going on as this movie doesn't have training wheels either, it's a straight up cold blooded gangster film that makes many others pale in comparison (including it's successor, New Jack City). I like all of the other movies I mentioned here for comparison purposes, I dare say Scarface I still enjoy more personally. But if you consider yourself a gangster flick fan, watch this film and decide for yourself who is the "king of new york"

    Working with his frequent collaborator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John, NYC based independent filmmaker Abel Ferrara uses the city as the backdrop for a memorably seedy and garishly lit story of cops and hoods, focusing on a veteran crime lord named Frank White (Christopher Walken). Frank's been out of the game for a long time due to a prison stretch, and now he's developed some sense of morality. Assisted by a mostly black crew, he sets about brutally eliminating his rivals, intending to spend the money he makes on improving his neighbourhood. Naturally, there's a team of detectives (among them, characters played by David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo) out to get him. Ferrara, as could be expected, has a great sense of style, nicely capturing the look of his locations. The score by Joe Delia complements the visuals created by a team including cinematographer Bojan Bazelli. Granted, the movie is very grim and gritty stuff, and it may be too violent for some tastes, but it's gripping as hell and the characters are all compulsively watchable. Walken is understated in the lead role, and surrounded by good actors. In fact, there's a lot of familiar faces in the cast. In addition to those mentioned, Laurence Fishburne (displaying a magnetic presence as a drug abusing thug), Janet Julian, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Calderon, Steve Buscemi, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Frank Adonis, Vanessa Angel, Robert LaSardo, James Lorinz, and Harold Perrineau all turn up as well, making this fun to watch. One especially great sequence takes place in the rain during the aftermath of an assault on Whites' compound. The movie begins well and keeps moving fast (it's 104 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it) with one entertaining scene after another, and in the end it packs a pretty hard punch. Highly recommended to fans of crime fiction. Eight out of 10.

    This is most likely Director Ferrara's most accessible Movie. Most of his Films are so quirky, offbeat, and personal with an Art-House/Grindhouse dichotomy that doesn't set to well with casual Movie goers. This one, and perhaps Bad Lieutenant (1992), are Crime Thrillers that call in the masses and give them enough style and grit to garner reluctant approval. But not everyone was entertained. Initially this was a dismissed and protested Movie called trashy, indulgent, and reprehensible. That's what made it the Cult Movie it is today. The over abundance of style and uncompromising, lurid appeal that has a staying power and is unforgettable. There is a metaphorically alluring Character in Frank White (is that name Black Enough For Ya) who is a pale-faced, monstrous, Vampyric Robin Hood as charming as the Devil himself. Like Jesus, he hangs with the dregs, in the bad part of town, but can be found at the Plaza Hotel planning his take down of the worst of the worst. Rival Gangs and crooked, selfish Politicians (Money Changers). This is a Great Neo-Noir that exudes an atmosphere of dark blueness. There is virtually no sunlight in this story of Under Worldliness and it has a nightmarish template of Violence, Decadence, and some Dark Philosophy delivered from a likable chilling Gangster.

    The early 1990s saw a huge resurgence in "gangster movies" ("Goodfellas", "Godfather 3", "New Jack City", "Boys in the Hood", "Mobsters", "Dick Tracy", "Juice", "Clockers", "Dead Presidents", "Menance to Society", "Miller's Crossing" etc etc). One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's "King of New York". The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some. White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg  a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped. Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that "legal methods" aren't "sucessful enough", they thus resort to violent, "extralegal" measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate. Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clich&eacute;s to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood. Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic: lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's "The Terminator" was "King's" chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary. But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an "aesthetic" plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like "Scarface" (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away  "the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort" etc etc  but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only "well dressed" person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest. "King" ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. "I didn't want to make money that way," he says in his epitaph. "And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it." In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment. Upon release, "King" was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its "irresponsibleness", before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works ("R'Xmas", "Last Day on Earth", "New Rose Hotel", "Go Go Tales" etc) and its law/order, wealth/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere "King" indulges in Ferrara's three loves: sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's "Nosferatu's" is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    King Of New York is one of the best Gangster Films and Crime Dramas ever made that's filled with stylish direction,Great performances from Christopher Walken and the whole cast,well-written screenplay and great Action. This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved. King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York. King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was "cleaned-up" by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the "Bad Guys" because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the "Good Guys" because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic. The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well. The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara. The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks. In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    How do I sum up this film? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to : (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things. The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever. There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this: Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky. Poor effort - 3/10.

    Abel Ferrara, the director is known for his pitch black flicks. Fear City (1984), Ms 45 (1981), The Driller Killer (1979), who doesn't know this depressive flicks. Here Abel takes the mobster genre to the dark of New York. Although that it never becomes rough or messy there's a bit of blood here and there, but it's really the story that makes you watch King Of New York and not only that, the performances are sublime especially Christopher Walker as the king Frank White who just came out of prison and wants to take New York back in his hands. But the cops look close but can't really take him back to prison so one cop Dennis Gilly (Davis Caruso) takes the rights in his hands and hunts down Frank. But things doesn't work out as it should be. Just look how many well known names are in this flick. And they all do an excellent job. The flick itself doesn't look like a nineties flick because it's rather a slow builder. You can easily qualify this amongst the top ten list of best crime films. Not that many people knew of its existence so you better move to catch yourself a copy, also available on Blu Ray. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets. King of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city's money, or the bent cops that are on his back? In Walken's hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It's a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy ("yo, where the chicken at?" he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters. For anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It's a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara's gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara's finest, and most 'polished' work. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A New York drug lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is being driven in his limousine back into the city following his release from prison. His crew are busy taking out a rival Columbian gang who have been encroaching on White's business while he's been away. Once he's back White wastes no time in taking out more of New York's crime lords and cements himself as the King of New York. Disgruntled that they are never able to get charges to stick, a few wild Police Officers decide that the only way to stop White and his gang is to take them out. Featuring an impressive cast which alongside Walken includes gangsters Laurence Fishburne, Steve Buscemi, Giancarlo Esposito and Theresa Randle with Cops Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo and David Caruso the film is a tale of good vs evil, but as you'd expect the lines between the two are blurred. Although not in the same league as the likes of Scarface, Carlito's Way or Serpico all of which share themes with this, it is a decent gangster picture. The story is fairly basic really. Gang boss gets released from prison; starts to rebuild his empire and the cops try to stop him. There is little new plot wise. The only little twist on the genre is the cop's tactic of halting the gangster's operation. I wasn't really invested in the story or many of the characters though there were some good performances. Much like the plot they were all characters you've seen before to some degree or another. There's the level headed, ice cold killer of a boss, the ostentatious black gangsters, the Irish cops, the Latino middle man, the Mafioso, the Chinese Triads and various scantily clad women. Unfortunately it's all been seen and done before. As I say though there are some terrific performances. Christopher Walken delivers a powerful and menacing performance as Frank White. He's calm and calculating but isn't afraid to deliver the killer blow. The character also has a side to him which makes the audience empathize with him and the way in which Walken creates this is brilliant. Another great performance is Laurence Fishburne as an arrogant and flashy gangster/killer. He is especially good in the chicken shop scene. Victor Argo is also great. The highlight of the film for me was the incredible soundtrack. I have somewhat of a puncheon for late 80s Hip-Hop and this film features some of the best that era had to offer with the likes of Party Posse and Schooly D lending songs. The traditional score which is interspersed with the Hip-Hop works well and sounds good. As well as the soundtrack there was also some pretty jazzy dancing, most notably from Walken. It reminded me of the video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice, a video I could watch over and over again. In addition as the slightly tired plot another problem with the film is the hair. I've never seen such bad hair in a film before. Half the cast sport mullets and Christopher Walken's is characteristically crazy. I did enjoy the two big shoot-outs. They were both action packed and the first must have had some influence on Grand Theft Auto as it looked just like the sort of shoot-out that game would present. In the end King of New York is an average gangster film but nothing more. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    A top gangster called Frank White is released from prison and decides he wants to make a positive social contribution to his New York neighbourhood in the form of a public hospital. He requests help in this enterprise from his fellow gang lords, who refuse to co-operate, leading to a mob war. This gangster film was helmed by maverick director Abel Ferrara who specialises in gritty urban stories set in New York. This is one of his most accessible in many ways  it isn't quite as grim as the likes of The Driller Killer or Bad Lieutenant  but it's still a pretty typical bit of work. This one is all about moral ambiguity. Frank White eliminates his rivals because he doesn't like the ethics of their business practices, yet he still sells drugs on the streets to make money but he wants to use this cash to save a ghetto hospital. It's a film full of shades of grey. No one is good and no one is bad, everyone is in between. The criminals have a conscience, yet continue to commit crimes, while the police hunt these law breakers yet act like just another gang of thugs in doing so. The film is immeasurably helped by excellent acting from Christopher Walken in the central role. It's hardly surprising, seeing as Walken is a fantastic actor who always brings something interesting and compelling to dark roles such as this. There are a lot of great support players too, with good solid turns in particular from Laurence Fishburne and David Caruso. While the hip-hop soundtrack is very effective and adds to the sense of time and place. It's overall a very good crime movie.

    I give the title "King of Gangster Flicks" for many reasons.... no spoilers. First off, I would try to find the DVD release of this film, when I first viewed the movie a few years back it was on VHS and the quality of picture was rather poor (very dark, hard to tell what exactly was going on). With the DVD version it is much more of a pleasurable viewing experience, but only because of the picture quality. This film isn't cute, it doesn't hold back, and it doesn't cater to Hollywood or MTV ideals (Though it was pre-MTV as it is today)... IMO this stands right next to Scarface as it's ugly yankee twin brother .. Cocaine is visible in actor's noses, real-life sounding script w/out catch phrases meant to kickstart a merchandise line, rather unattractive cast and characters that make this movie a real mean flick. Most people confuse this for bad acting and dialogue, but what's meant to be portrayed here is gangsters without the glitter and fame and Hollywood- ization, this movie goes for truth. I had to watch the movie several times to fully digest what was going on as this movie doesn't have training wheels either, it's a straight up cold blooded gangster film that makes many others pale in comparison (including it's successor, New Jack City). I like all of the other movies I mentioned here for comparison purposes, I dare say Scarface I still enjoy more personally. But if you consider yourself a gangster flick fan, watch this film and decide for yourself who is the "king of new york"

    Working with his frequent collaborator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John, NYC based independent filmmaker Abel Ferrara uses the city as the backdrop for a memorably seedy and garishly lit story of cops and hoods, focusing on a veteran crime lord named Frank White (Christopher Walken). Frank's been out of the game for a long time due to a prison stretch, and now he's developed some sense of morality. Assisted by a mostly black crew, he sets about brutally eliminating his rivals, intending to spend the money he makes on improving his neighbourhood. Naturally, there's a team of detectives (among them, characters played by David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo) out to get him. Ferrara, as could be expected, has a great sense of style, nicely capturing the look of his locations. The score by Joe Delia complements the visuals created by a team including cinematographer Bojan Bazelli. Granted, the movie is very grim and gritty stuff, and it may be too violent for some tastes, but it's gripping as hell and the characters are all compulsively watchable. Walken is understated in the lead role, and surrounded by good actors. In fact, there's a lot of familiar faces in the cast. In addition to those mentioned, Laurence Fishburne (displaying a magnetic presence as a drug abusing thug), Janet Julian, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Calderon, Steve Buscemi, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Frank Adonis, Vanessa Angel, Robert LaSardo, James Lorinz, and Harold Perrineau all turn up as well, making this fun to watch. One especially great sequence takes place in the rain during the aftermath of an assault on Whites' compound. The movie begins well and keeps moving fast (it's 104 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it) with one entertaining scene after another, and in the end it packs a pretty hard punch. Highly recommended to fans of crime fiction. Eight out of 10.

    This is most likely Director Ferrara's most accessible Movie. Most of his Films are so quirky, offbeat, and personal with an Art-House/Grindhouse dichotomy that doesn't set to well with casual Movie goers. This one, and perhaps Bad Lieutenant (1992), are Crime Thrillers that call in the masses and give them enough style and grit to garner reluctant approval. But not everyone was entertained. Initially this was a dismissed and protested Movie called trashy, indulgent, and reprehensible. That's what made it the Cult Movie it is today. The over abundance of style and uncompromising, lurid appeal that has a staying power and is unforgettable. There is a metaphorically alluring Character in Frank White (is that name Black Enough For Ya) who is a pale-faced, monstrous, Vampyric Robin Hood as charming as the Devil himself. Like Jesus, he hangs with the dregs, in the bad part of town, but can be found at the Plaza Hotel planning his take down of the worst of the worst. Rival Gangs and crooked, selfish Politicians (Money Changers). This is a Great Neo-Noir that exudes an atmosphere of dark blueness. There is virtually no sunlight in this story of Under Worldliness and it has a nightmarish template of Violence, Decadence, and some Dark Philosophy delivered from a likable chilling Gangster.

    The early 1990s saw a huge resurgence in "gangster movies" ("Goodfellas", "Godfather 3", "New Jack City", "Boys in the Hood", "Mobsters", "Dick Tracy", "Juice", "Clockers", "Dead Presidents", "Menance to Society", "Miller's Crossing" etc etc). One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's "King of New York". The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some. White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg  a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped. Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that "legal methods" aren't "sucessful enough", they thus resort to violent, "extralegal" measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate. Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clich&eacute;s to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood. Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic: lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's "The Terminator" was "King's" chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary. But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an "aesthetic" plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like "Scarface" (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away  "the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort" etc etc  but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only "well dressed" person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest. "King" ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. "I didn't want to make money that way," he says in his epitaph. "And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it." In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment. Upon release, "King" was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its "irresponsibleness", before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works ("R'Xmas", "Last Day on Earth", "New Rose Hotel", "Go Go Tales" etc) and its law/order, wealth/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere "King" indulges in Ferrara's three loves: sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's "Nosferatu's" is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    King Of New York is one of the best Gangster Films and Crime Dramas ever made that's filled with stylish direction,Great performances from Christopher Walken and the whole cast,well-written screenplay and great Action. This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved. King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York. King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was "cleaned-up" by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the "Bad Guys" because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the "Good Guys" because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic. The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well. The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara. The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks. In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    How do I sum up this film? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to : (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things. The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever. There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this: Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky. Poor effort - 3/10.

    Abel Ferrara, the director is known for his pitch black flicks. Fear City (1984), Ms 45 (1981), The Driller Killer (1979), who doesn't know this depressive flicks. Here Abel takes the mobster genre to the dark of New York. Although that it never becomes rough or messy there's a bit of blood here and there, but it's really the story that makes you watch King Of New York and not only that, the performances are sublime especially Christopher Walker as the king Frank White who just came out of prison and wants to take New York back in his hands. But the cops look close but can't really take him back to prison so one cop Dennis Gilly (Davis Caruso) takes the rights in his hands and hunts down Frank. But things doesn't work out as it should be. Just look how many well known names are in this flick. And they all do an excellent job. The flick itself doesn't look like a nineties flick because it's rather a slow builder. You can easily qualify this amongst the top ten list of best crime films. Not that many people knew of its existence so you better move to catch yourself a copy, also available on Blu Ray. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets. King of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city's money, or the bent cops that are on his back? In Walken's hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It's a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy ("yo, where the chicken at?" he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters. For anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It's a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara's gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara's finest, and most 'polished' work. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A New York drug lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is being driven in his limousine back into the city following his release from prison. His crew are busy taking out a rival Columbian gang who have been encroaching on White's business while he's been away. Once he's back White wastes no time in taking out more of New York's crime lords and cements himself as the King of New York. Disgruntled that they are never able to get charges to stick, a few wild Police Officers decide that the only way to stop White and his gang is to take them out. Featuring an impressive cast which alongside Walken includes gangsters Laurence Fishburne, Steve Buscemi, Giancarlo Esposito and Theresa Randle with Cops Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo and David Caruso the film is a tale of good vs evil, but as you'd expect the lines between the two are blurred. Although not in the same league as the likes of Scarface, Carlito's Way or Serpico all of which share themes with this, it is a decent gangster picture. The story is fairly basic really. Gang boss gets released from prison; starts to rebuild his empire and the cops try to stop him. There is little new plot wise. The only little twist on the genre is the cop's tactic of halting the gangster's operation. I wasn't really invested in the story or many of the characters though there were some good performances. Much like the plot they were all characters you've seen before to some degree or another. There's the level headed, ice cold killer of a boss, the ostentatious black gangsters, the Irish cops, the Latino middle man, the Mafioso, the Chinese Triads and various scantily clad women. Unfortunately it's all been seen and done before. As I say though there are some terrific performances. Christopher Walken delivers a powerful and menacing performance as Frank White. He's calm and calculating but isn't afraid to deliver the killer blow. The character also has a side to him which makes the audience empathize with him and the way in which Walken creates this is brilliant. Another great performance is Laurence Fishburne as an arrogant and flashy gangster/killer. He is especially good in the chicken shop scene. Victor Argo is also great. The highlight of the film for me was the incredible soundtrack. I have somewhat of a puncheon for late 80s Hip-Hop and this film features some of the best that era had to offer with the likes of Party Posse and Schooly D lending songs. The traditional score which is interspersed with the Hip-Hop works well and sounds good. As well as the soundtrack there was also some pretty jazzy dancing, most notably from Walken. It reminded me of the video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice, a video I could watch over and over again. In addition as the slightly tired plot another problem with the film is the hair. I've never seen such bad hair in a film before. Half the cast sport mullets and Christopher Walken's is characteristically crazy. I did enjoy the two big shoot-outs. They were both action packed and the first must have had some influence on Grand Theft Auto as it looked just like the sort of shoot-out that game would present. In the end King of New York is an average gangster film but nothing more. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    A top gangster called Frank White is released from prison and decides he wants to make a positive social contribution to his New York neighbourhood in the form of a public hospital. He requests help in this enterprise from his fellow gang lords, who refuse to co-operate, leading to a mob war. This gangster film was helmed by maverick director Abel Ferrara who specialises in gritty urban stories set in New York. This is one of his most accessible in many ways  it isn't quite as grim as the likes of The Driller Killer or Bad Lieutenant  but it's still a pretty typical bit of work. This one is all about moral ambiguity. Frank White eliminates his rivals because he doesn't like the ethics of their business practices, yet he still sells drugs on the streets to make money but he wants to use this cash to save a ghetto hospital. It's a film full of shades of grey. No one is good and no one is bad, everyone is in between. The criminals have a conscience, yet continue to commit crimes, while the police hunt these law breakers yet act like just another gang of thugs in doing so. The film is immeasurably helped by excellent acting from Christopher Walken in the central role. It's hardly surprising, seeing as Walken is a fantastic actor who always brings something interesting and compelling to dark roles such as this. There are a lot of great support players too, with good solid turns in particular from Laurence Fishburne and David Caruso. While the hip-hop soundtrack is very effective and adds to the sense of time and place. It's overall a very good crime movie.

    I give the title "King of Gangster Flicks" for many reasons.... no spoilers. First off, I would try to find the DVD release of this film, when I first viewed the movie a few years back it was on VHS and the quality of picture was rather poor (very dark, hard to tell what exactly was going on). With the DVD version it is much more of a pleasurable viewing experience, but only because of the picture quality. This film isn't cute, it doesn't hold back, and it doesn't cater to Hollywood or MTV ideals (Though it was pre-MTV as it is today)... IMO this stands right next to Scarface as it's ugly yankee twin brother .. Cocaine is visible in actor's noses, real-life sounding script w/out catch phrases meant to kickstart a merchandise line, rather unattractive cast and characters that make this movie a real mean flick. Most people confuse this for bad acting and dialogue, but what's meant to be portrayed here is gangsters without the glitter and fame and Hollywood- ization, this movie goes for truth. I had to watch the movie several times to fully digest what was going on as this movie doesn't have training wheels either, it's a straight up cold blooded gangster film that makes many others pale in comparison (including it's successor, New Jack City). I like all of the other movies I mentioned here for comparison purposes, I dare say Scarface I still enjoy more personally. But if you consider yourself a gangster flick fan, watch this film and decide for yourself who is the "king of new york"

    Working with his frequent collaborator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John, NYC based independent filmmaker Abel Ferrara uses the city as the backdrop for a memorably seedy and garishly lit story of cops and hoods, focusing on a veteran crime lord named Frank White (Christopher Walken). Frank's been out of the game for a long time due to a prison stretch, and now he's developed some sense of morality. Assisted by a mostly black crew, he sets about brutally eliminating his rivals, intending to spend the money he makes on improving his neighbourhood. Naturally, there's a team of detectives (among them, characters played by David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo) out to get him. Ferrara, as could be expected, has a great sense of style, nicely capturing the look of his locations. The score by Joe Delia complements the visuals created by a team including cinematographer Bojan Bazelli. Granted, the movie is very grim and gritty stuff, and it may be too violent for some tastes, but it's gripping as hell and the characters are all compulsively watchable. Walken is understated in the lead role, and surrounded by good actors. In fact, there's a lot of familiar faces in the cast. In addition to those mentioned, Laurence Fishburne (displaying a magnetic presence as a drug abusing thug), Janet Julian, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Calderon, Steve Buscemi, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Frank Adonis, Vanessa Angel, Robert LaSardo, James Lorinz, and Harold Perrineau all turn up as well, making this fun to watch. One especially great sequence takes place in the rain during the aftermath of an assault on Whites' compound. The movie begins well and keeps moving fast (it's 104 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it) with one entertaining scene after another, and in the end it packs a pretty hard punch. Highly recommended to fans of crime fiction. Eight out of 10.

    This is most likely Director Ferrara's most accessible Movie. Most of his Films are so quirky, offbeat, and personal with an Art-House/Grindhouse dichotomy that doesn't set to well with casual Movie goers. This one, and perhaps Bad Lieutenant (1992), are Crime Thrillers that call in the masses and give them enough style and grit to garner reluctant approval. But not everyone was entertained. Initially this was a dismissed and protested Movie called trashy, indulgent, and reprehensible. That's what made it the Cult Movie it is today. The over abundance of style and uncompromising, lurid appeal that has a staying power and is unforgettable. There is a metaphorically alluring Character in Frank White (is that name Black Enough For Ya) who is a pale-faced, monstrous, Vampyric Robin Hood as charming as the Devil himself. Like Jesus, he hangs with the dregs, in the bad part of town, but can be found at the Plaza Hotel planning his take down of the worst of the worst. Rival Gangs and crooked, selfish Politicians (Money Changers). This is a Great Neo-Noir that exudes an atmosphere of dark blueness. There is virtually no sunlight in this story of Under Worldliness and it has a nightmarish template of Violence, Decadence, and some Dark Philosophy delivered from a likable chilling Gangster.

    The early 1990s saw a huge resurgence in "gangster movies" ("Goodfellas", "Godfather 3", "New Jack City", "Boys in the Hood", "Mobsters", "Dick Tracy", "Juice", "Clockers", "Dead Presidents", "Menance to Society", "Miller's Crossing" etc etc). One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's "King of New York". The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some. White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg  a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped. Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that "legal methods" aren't "sucessful enough", they thus resort to violent, "extralegal" measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate. Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clich&eacute;s to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood. Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic: lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's "The Terminator" was "King's" chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary. But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an "aesthetic" plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like "Scarface" (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away  "the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort" etc etc  but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only "well dressed" person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest. "King" ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. "I didn't want to make money that way," he says in his epitaph. "And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it." In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment. Upon release, "King" was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its "irresponsibleness", before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works ("R'Xmas", "Last Day on Earth", "New Rose Hotel", "Go Go Tales" etc) and its law/order, wealth/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere "King" indulges in Ferrara's three loves: sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's "Nosferatu's" is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    King Of New York is one of the best Gangster Films and Crime Dramas ever made that's filled with stylish direction,Great performances from Christopher Walken and the whole cast,well-written screenplay and great Action. This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved. King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York. King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was "cleaned-up" by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the "Bad Guys" because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the "Good Guys" because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic. The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well. The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara. The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks. In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    How do I sum up this film? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to : (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things. The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever. There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this: Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky. Poor effort - 3/10.

    Abel Ferrara, the director is known for his pitch black flicks. Fear City (1984), Ms 45 (1981), The Driller Killer (1979), who doesn't know this depressive flicks. Here Abel takes the mobster genre to the dark of New York. Although that it never becomes rough or messy there's a bit of blood here and there, but it's really the story that makes you watch King Of New York and not only that, the performances are sublime especially Christopher Walker as the king Frank White who just came out of prison and wants to take New York back in his hands. But the cops look close but can't really take him back to prison so one cop Dennis Gilly (Davis Caruso) takes the rights in his hands and hunts down Frank. But things doesn't work out as it should be. Just look how many well known names are in this flick. And they all do an excellent job. The flick itself doesn't look like a nineties flick because it's rather a slow builder. You can easily qualify this amongst the top ten list of best crime films. Not that many people knew of its existence so you better move to catch yourself a copy, also available on Blu Ray. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets. King of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city's money, or the bent cops that are on his back? In Walken's hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It's a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy ("yo, where the chicken at?" he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters. For anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It's a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara's gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara's finest, and most 'polished' work. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A New York drug lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is being driven in his limousine back into the city following his release from prison. His crew are busy taking out a rival Columbian gang who have been encroaching on White's business while he's been away. Once he's back White wastes no time in taking out more of New York's crime lords and cements himself as the King of New York. Disgruntled that they are never able to get charges to stick, a few wild Police Officers decide that the only way to stop White and his gang is to take them out. Featuring an impressive cast which alongside Walken includes gangsters Laurence Fishburne, Steve Buscemi, Giancarlo Esposito and Theresa Randle with Cops Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo and David Caruso the film is a tale of good vs evil, but as you'd expect the lines between the two are blurred. Although not in the same league as the likes of Scarface, Carlito's Way or Serpico all of which share themes with this, it is a decent gangster picture. The story is fairly basic really. Gang boss gets released from prison; starts to rebuild his empire and the cops try to stop him. There is little new plot wise. The only little twist on the genre is the cop's tactic of halting the gangster's operation. I wasn't really invested in the story or many of the characters though there were some good performances. Much like the plot they were all characters you've seen before to some degree or another. There's the level headed, ice cold killer of a boss, the ostentatious black gangsters, the Irish cops, the Latino middle man, the Mafioso, the Chinese Triads and various scantily clad women. Unfortunately it's all been seen and done before. As I say though there are some terrific performances. Christopher Walken delivers a powerful and menacing performance as Frank White. He's calm and calculating but isn't afraid to deliver the killer blow. The character also has a side to him which makes the audience empathize with him and the way in which Walken creates this is brilliant. Another great performance is Laurence Fishburne as an arrogant and flashy gangster/killer. He is especially good in the chicken shop scene. Victor Argo is also great. The highlight of the film for me was the incredible soundtrack. I have somewhat of a puncheon for late 80s Hip-Hop and this film features some of the best that era had to offer with the likes of Party Posse and Schooly D lending songs. The traditional score which is interspersed with the Hip-Hop works well and sounds good. As well as the soundtrack there was also some pretty jazzy dancing, most notably from Walken. It reminded me of the video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice, a video I could watch over and over again. In addition as the slightly tired plot another problem with the film is the hair. I've never seen such bad hair in a film before. Half the cast sport mullets and Christopher Walken's is characteristically crazy. I did enjoy the two big shoot-outs. They were both action packed and the first must have had some influence on Grand Theft Auto as it looked just like the sort of shoot-out that game would present. In the end King of New York is an average gangster film but nothing more. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    A top gangster called Frank White is released from prison and decides he wants to make a positive social contribution to his New York neighbourhood in the form of a public hospital. He requests help in this enterprise from his fellow gang lords, who refuse to co-operate, leading to a mob war. This gangster film was helmed by maverick director Abel Ferrara who specialises in gritty urban stories set in New York. This is one of his most accessible in many ways  it isn't quite as grim as the likes of The Driller Killer or Bad Lieutenant  but it's still a pretty typical bit of work. This one is all about moral ambiguity. Frank White eliminates his rivals because he doesn't like the ethics of their business practices, yet he still sells drugs on the streets to make money but he wants to use this cash to save a ghetto hospital. It's a film full of shades of grey. No one is good and no one is bad, everyone is in between. The criminals have a conscience, yet continue to commit crimes, while the police hunt these law breakers yet act like just another gang of thugs in doing so. The film is immeasurably helped by excellent acting from Christopher Walken in the central role. It's hardly surprising, seeing as Walken is a fantastic actor who always brings something interesting and compelling to dark roles such as this. There are a lot of great support players too, with good solid turns in particular from Laurence Fishburne and David Caruso. While the hip-hop soundtrack is very effective and adds to the sense of time and place. It's overall a very good crime movie.

    I give the title "King of Gangster Flicks" for many reasons.... no spoilers. First off, I would try to find the DVD release of this film, when I first viewed the movie a few years back it was on VHS and the quality of picture was rather poor (very dark, hard to tell what exactly was going on). With the DVD version it is much more of a pleasurable viewing experience, but only because of the picture quality. This film isn't cute, it doesn't hold back, and it doesn't cater to Hollywood or MTV ideals (Though it was pre-MTV as it is today)... IMO this stands right next to Scarface as it's ugly yankee twin brother .. Cocaine is visible in actor's noses, real-life sounding script w/out catch phrases meant to kickstart a merchandise line, rather unattractive cast and characters that make this movie a real mean flick. Most people confuse this for bad acting and dialogue, but what's meant to be portrayed here is gangsters without the glitter and fame and Hollywood- ization, this movie goes for truth. I had to watch the movie several times to fully digest what was going on as this movie doesn't have training wheels either, it's a straight up cold blooded gangster film that makes many others pale in comparison (including it's successor, New Jack City). I like all of the other movies I mentioned here for comparison purposes, I dare say Scarface I still enjoy more personally. But if you consider yourself a gangster flick fan, watch this film and decide for yourself who is the "king of new york"

    Working with his frequent collaborator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John, NYC based independent filmmaker Abel Ferrara uses the city as the backdrop for a memorably seedy and garishly lit story of cops and hoods, focusing on a veteran crime lord named Frank White (Christopher Walken). Frank's been out of the game for a long time due to a prison stretch, and now he's developed some sense of morality. Assisted by a mostly black crew, he sets about brutally eliminating his rivals, intending to spend the money he makes on improving his neighbourhood. Naturally, there's a team of detectives (among them, characters played by David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo) out to get him. Ferrara, as could be expected, has a great sense of style, nicely capturing the look of his locations. The score by Joe Delia complements the visuals created by a team including cinematographer Bojan Bazelli. Granted, the movie is very grim and gritty stuff, and it may be too violent for some tastes, but it's gripping as hell and the characters are all compulsively watchable. Walken is understated in the lead role, and surrounded by good actors. In fact, there's a lot of familiar faces in the cast. In addition to those mentioned, Laurence Fishburne (displaying a magnetic presence as a drug abusing thug), Janet Julian, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Calderon, Steve Buscemi, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Frank Adonis, Vanessa Angel, Robert LaSardo, James Lorinz, and Harold Perrineau all turn up as well, making this fun to watch. One especially great sequence takes place in the rain during the aftermath of an assault on Whites' compound. The movie begins well and keeps moving fast (it's 104 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it) with one entertaining scene after another, and in the end it packs a pretty hard punch. Highly recommended to fans of crime fiction. Eight out of 10.

    This is most likely Director Ferrara's most accessible Movie. Most of his Films are so quirky, offbeat, and personal with an Art-House/Grindhouse dichotomy that doesn't set to well with casual Movie goers. This one, and perhaps Bad Lieutenant (1992), are Crime Thrillers that call in the masses and give them enough style and grit to garner reluctant approval. But not everyone was entertained. Initially this was a dismissed and protested Movie called trashy, indulgent, and reprehensible. That's what made it the Cult Movie it is today. The over abundance of style and uncompromising, lurid appeal that has a staying power and is unforgettable. There is a metaphorically alluring Character in Frank White (is that name Black Enough For Ya) who is a pale-faced, monstrous, Vampyric Robin Hood as charming as the Devil himself. Like Jesus, he hangs with the dregs, in the bad part of town, but can be found at the Plaza Hotel planning his take down of the worst of the worst. Rival Gangs and crooked, selfish Politicians (Money Changers). This is a Great Neo-Noir that exudes an atmosphere of dark blueness. There is virtually no sunlight in this story of Under Worldliness and it has a nightmarish template of Violence, Decadence, and some Dark Philosophy delivered from a likable chilling Gangster.

    The early 1990s saw a huge resurgence in "gangster movies" ("Goodfellas", "Godfather 3", "New Jack City", "Boys in the Hood", "Mobsters", "Dick Tracy", "Juice", "Clockers", "Dead Presidents", "Menance to Society", "Miller's Crossing" etc etc). One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's "King of New York". The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some. White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg  a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped. Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that "legal methods" aren't "sucessful enough", they thus resort to violent, "extralegal" measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate. Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clich&eacute;s to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood. Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic: lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's "The Terminator" was "King's" chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary. But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an "aesthetic" plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like "Scarface" (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away  "the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort" etc etc  but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only "well dressed" person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest. "King" ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. "I didn't want to make money that way," he says in his epitaph. "And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it." In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment. Upon release, "King" was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its "irresponsibleness", before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works ("R'Xmas", "Last Day on Earth", "New Rose Hotel", "Go Go Tales" etc) and its law/order, wealth/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere "King" indulges in Ferrara's three loves: sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's "Nosferatu's" is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    One Of The Best Gangster Films/Crime Drama Ever Made And An Underrated Classic With an Excellent Performance From Christopher Walken.

    King Of New York is one of the best Gangster Films and Crime Dramas ever made that's filled with stylish direction,Great performances from Christopher Walken and the whole cast,well-written screenplay and great Action. This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved. King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York. King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was "cleaned-up" by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the "Bad Guys" because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the "Good Guys" because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic. The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well. The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara. The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks. In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    How do I sum up this film? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to : (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things. The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever. There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this: Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky. Poor effort - 3/10.

    Abel Ferrara, the director is known for his pitch black flicks. Fear City (1984), Ms 45 (1981), The Driller Killer (1979), who doesn't know this depressive flicks. Here Abel takes the mobster genre to the dark of New York. Although that it never becomes rough or messy there's a bit of blood here and there, but it's really the story that makes you watch King Of New York and not only that, the performances are sublime especially Christopher Walker as the king Frank White who just came out of prison and wants to take New York back in his hands. But the cops look close but can't really take him back to prison so one cop Dennis Gilly (Davis Caruso) takes the rights in his hands and hunts down Frank. But things doesn't work out as it should be. Just look how many well known names are in this flick. And they all do an excellent job. The flick itself doesn't look like a nineties flick because it's rather a slow builder. You can easily qualify this amongst the top ten list of best crime films. Not that many people knew of its existence so you better move to catch yourself a copy, also available on Blu Ray. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets. King of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city's money, or the bent cops that are on his back? In Walken's hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It's a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy ("yo, where the chicken at?" he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters. For anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It's a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara's gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara's finest, and most 'polished' work. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A New York drug lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is being driven in his limousine back into the city following his release from prison. His crew are busy taking out a rival Columbian gang who have been encroaching on White's business while he's been away. Once he's back White wastes no time in taking out more of New York's crime lords and cements himself as the King of New York. Disgruntled that they are never able to get charges to stick, a few wild Police Officers decide that the only way to stop White and his gang is to take them out. Featuring an impressive cast which alongside Walken includes gangsters Laurence Fishburne, Steve Buscemi, Giancarlo Esposito and Theresa Randle with Cops Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo and David Caruso the film is a tale of good vs evil, but as you'd expect the lines between the two are blurred. Although not in the same league as the likes of Scarface, Carlito's Way or Serpico all of which share themes with this, it is a decent gangster picture. The story is fairly basic really. Gang boss gets released from prison; starts to rebuild his empire and the cops try to stop him. There is little new plot wise. The only little twist on the genre is the cop's tactic of halting the gangster's operation. I wasn't really invested in the story or many of the characters though there were some good performances. Much like the plot they were all characters you've seen before to some degree or another. There's the level headed, ice cold killer of a boss, the ostentatious black gangsters, the Irish cops, the Latino middle man, the Mafioso, the Chinese Triads and various scantily clad women. Unfortunately it's all been seen and done before. As I say though there are some terrific performances. Christopher Walken delivers a powerful and menacing performance as Frank White. He's calm and calculating but isn't afraid to deliver the killer blow. The character also has a side to him which makes the audience empathize with him and the way in which Walken creates this is brilliant. Another great performance is Laurence Fishburne as an arrogant and flashy gangster/killer. He is especially good in the chicken shop scene. Victor Argo is also great. The highlight of the film for me was the incredible soundtrack. I have somewhat of a puncheon for late 80s Hip-Hop and this film features some of the best that era had to offer with the likes of Party Posse and Schooly D lending songs. The traditional score which is interspersed with the Hip-Hop works well and sounds good. As well as the soundtrack there was also some pretty jazzy dancing, most notably from Walken. It reminded me of the video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice, a video I could watch over and over again. In addition as the slightly tired plot another problem with the film is the hair. I've never seen such bad hair in a film before. Half the cast sport mullets and Christopher Walken's is characteristically crazy. I did enjoy the two big shoot-outs. They were both action packed and the first must have had some influence on Grand Theft Auto as it looked just like the sort of shoot-out that game would present. In the end King of New York is an average gangster film but nothing more. www.attheback.blogspot.com

    A top gangster called Frank White is released from prison and decides he wants to make a positive social contribution to his New York neighbourhood in the form of a public hospital. He requests help in this enterprise from his fellow gang lords, who refuse to co-operate, leading to a mob war. This gangster film was helmed by maverick director Abel Ferrara who specialises in gritty urban stories set in New York. This is one of his most accessible in many ways  it isn't quite as grim as the likes of The Driller Killer or Bad Lieutenant  but it's still a pretty typical bit of work. This one is all about moral ambiguity. Frank White eliminates his rivals because he doesn't like the ethics of their business practices, yet he still sells drugs on the streets to make money but he wants to use this cash to save a ghetto hospital. It's a film full of shades of grey. No one is good and no one is bad, everyone is in between. The criminals have a conscience, yet continue to commit crimes, while the police hunt these law breakers yet act like just another gang of thugs in doing so. The film is immeasurably helped by excellent acting from Christopher Walken in the central role. It's hardly surprising, seeing as Walken is a fantastic actor who always brings something interesting and compelling to dark roles such as this. There are a lot of great support players too, with good solid turns in particular from Laurence Fishburne and David Caruso. While the hip-hop soundtrack is very effective and adds to the sense of time and place. It's overall a very good crime movie.

    I give the title "King of Gangster Flicks" for many reasons.... no spoilers. First off, I would try to find the DVD release of this film, when I first viewed the movie a few years back it was on VHS and the quality of picture was rather poor (very dark, hard to tell what exactly was going on). With the DVD version it is much more of a pleasurable viewing experience, but only because of the picture quality. This film isn't cute, it doesn't hold back, and it doesn't cater to Hollywood or MTV ideals (Though it was pre-MTV as it is today)... IMO this stands right next to Scarface as it's ugly yankee twin brother .. Cocaine is visible in actor's noses, real-life sounding script w/out catch phrases meant to kickstart a merchandise line, rather unattractive cast and characters that make this movie a real mean flick. Most people confuse this for bad acting and dialogue, but what's meant to be portrayed here is gangsters without the glitter and fame and Hollywood- ization, this movie goes for truth. I had to watch the movie several times to fully digest what was going on as this movie doesn't have training wheels either, it's a straight up cold blooded gangster film that makes many others pale in comparison (including it's successor, New Jack City). I like all of the other movies I mentioned here for comparison purposes, I dare say Scarface I still enjoy more personally. But if you consider yourself a gangster flick fan, watch this film and decide for yourself who is the "king of new york"

    Working with his frequent collaborator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John, NYC based independent filmmaker Abel Ferrara uses the city as the backdrop for a memorably seedy and garishly lit story of cops and hoods, focusing on a veteran crime lord named Frank White (Christopher Walken). Frank's been out of the game for a long time due to a prison stretch, and now he's developed some sense of morality. Assisted by a mostly black crew, he sets about brutally eliminating his rivals, intending to spend the money he makes on improving his neighbourhood. Naturally, there's a team of detectives (among them, characters played by David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo) out to get him. Ferrara, as could be expected, has a great sense of style, nicely capturing the look of his locations. The score by Joe Delia complements the visuals created by a team including cinematographer Bojan Bazelli. Granted, the movie is very grim and gritty stuff, and it may be too violent for some tastes, but it's gripping as hell and the characters are all compulsively watchable. Walken is understated in the lead role, and surrounded by good actors. In fact, there's a lot of familiar faces in the cast. In addition to those mentioned, Laurence Fishburne (displaying a magnetic presence as a drug abusing thug), Janet Julian, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Calderon, Steve Buscemi, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Frank Adonis, Vanessa Angel, Robert LaSardo, James Lorinz, and Harold Perrineau all turn up as well, making this fun to watch. One especially great sequence takes place in the rain during the aftermath of an assault on Whites' compound. The movie begins well and keeps moving fast (it's 104 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it) with one entertaining scene after another, and in the end it packs a pretty hard punch. Highly recommended to fans of crime fiction. Eight out of 10.

    This is most likely Director Ferrara's most accessible Movie. Most of his Films are so quirky, offbeat, and personal with an Art-House/Grindhouse dichotomy that doesn't set to well with casual Movie goers. This one, and perhaps Bad Lieutenant (1992), are Crime Thrillers that call in the masses and give them enough style and grit to garner reluctant approval. But not everyone was entertained. Initially this was a dismissed and protested Movie called trashy, indulgent, and reprehensible. That's what made it the Cult Movie it is today. The over abundance of style and uncompromising, lurid appeal that has a staying power and is unforgettable. There is a metaphorically alluring Character in Frank White (is that name Black Enough For Ya) who is a pale-faced, monstrous, Vampyric Robin Hood as charming as the Devil himself. Like Jesus, he hangs with the dregs, in the bad part of town, but can be found at the Plaza Hotel planning his take down of the worst of the worst. Rival Gangs and crooked, selfish Politicians (Money Changers). This is a Great Neo-Noir that exudes an atmosphere of dark blueness. There is virtually no sunlight in this story of Under Worldliness and it has a nightmarish template of Violence, Decadence, and some Dark Philosophy delivered from a likable chilling Gangster.

    The early 1990s saw a huge resurgence in "gangster movies" ("Goodfellas", "Godfather 3", "New Jack City", "Boys in the Hood", "Mobsters", "Dick Tracy", "Juice", "Clockers", "Dead Presidents", "Menance to Society", "Miller's Crossing" etc etc). One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's "King of New York". The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some. White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg  a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped. Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that "legal methods" aren't "sucessful enough", they thus resort to violent, "extralegal" measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate. Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clich&eacute;s to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood. Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic: lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's "The Terminator" was "King's" chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary. But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an "aesthetic" plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like "Scarface" (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away  "the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort" etc etc  but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only "well dressed" person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest. "King" ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. "I didn't want to make money that way," he says in his epitaph. "And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it." In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment. Upon release, "King" was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its "irresponsibleness", before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works ("R'Xmas", "Last Day on Earth", "New Rose Hotel", "Go Go Tales" etc) and its law/order, wealth/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere "King" indulges in Ferrara's three loves: sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's "Nosferatu's" is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    One Of The Best Gangster Films/Crime Drama Ever Made And An Underrated Classic With an Excellent Performance From Christopher Walken.

    King Of New York is one of the best Gangster Films and Crime Dramas ever made that's filled with stylish direction,Great performances from Christopher Walken and the whole cast,well-written screenplay and great Action. This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved. King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York. King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was "cleaned-up" by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the "Bad Guys" because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the "Good Guys" because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic. The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well. The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara. The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks. In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time.

    How do I sum up this film? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to : (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things. The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever. There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this: Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky. Poor effort - 3/10.

    Abel Ferrara, the director is known for his pitch black flicks. Fear City (1984), Ms 45 (1981), The Driller Killer (1979), who doesn't know this depressive flicks. Here Abel takes the mobster genre to the dark of New York. Although that it never becomes rough or messy there's a bit of blood here and there, but it's really the story that makes you watch King Of New York and not only that, the performances are sublime especially Christopher Walker as the king Frank White who just came out of prison and wants to take New York back in his hands. But the cops look close but can't really take him back to prison so one cop Dennis Gilly (Davis Caruso) takes the rights in his hands and hunts down Frank. But things doesn't work out as it should be. Just look how many well known names are in this flick. And they all do an excellent job. The flick itself doesn't look like a nineties flick because it's rather a slow builder. You can easily qualify this amongst the top ten list of best crime films. Not that many people knew of its existence so you better move to catch yourself a copy, also available on Blu Ray. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

    Crime lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is released from prison, and on his long drive back to New York City, witnesses the filth his city has descended into since his incarceration. His old friend Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) has just wiped out a Colombian drug operation and welcomes Frank back with a suitcase full of money and cocaine. Eager to win his city back, and also help fund the saving of an inner city hospital through his drug operation, he sets the wheels to his crowning in motion. But cops Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Gilley (David Caruso) and Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are on his case, but after struggling to bring Frank in under regulations, resort to more illegal methods of getting him off the streets. King of New York was booed upon its initial screenings, with mass walk- outs and cult director Abel Ferrara being bombarded with uncomfortable questions. Audiences were apparently appalled by the films seemingly glamorous depiction of man who was essentially a homicidal maniac, encouraging violence and sleaze wherever he went. The film is certainly guilty of that, but the character of Frank is a little different to the likes of Tony Montana or Henry Hill. He seems to style himself as a champion of the lower-classes, using his influence and vast wealth to push a councilman to put forth the money to save a hospital in a poverty-stricken area, and then fund it himself when that fails. He and his girlfriend Jennifer (Janet Julian) are robbed on the subway by inner-city youths. Frank shown them his gun, and they back off, but Frank throws them a wad of money and tells them there is work for them if they want it. A crime-lord he may be, but is he any worse than the fat politicians that soak up the city's money, or the bent cops that are on his back? In Walken's hands, White is a charismatic, unconventional crime boss, and is in turns charming, strange, and deranged. It's a fabulous performance, but for me it was Laurence (here still credited as Larry) Fishburne that steals the show, as the swaggering, loud-mouthed gun-man Jimmy ("yo, where the chicken at?" he says after killing a cop), a man of such ridiculous posturing that he almost becomes a cartoon character. And this is one of the main reasons I loved this film. It is, at times, so outlandishly over-the-top that it should betray its gritty roots, but its so steeped in atmosphere and that key element, grime, that it becomes a fantasy-laden, insane ride amongst a decaying city and one its most colourful characters. For anyone who has seen the work of Abel Ferrara, especially two of his most popular films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Bad Lieutenant (1992), will know what they are in for. His New York is not the one you see in the earlier works of Woody Allen, but one of whacked-out prostitutes, cocaine-sniffing criminals, inner-city poverty, and angry, sweaty, middle-aged detectives. We do glimpse the glitzier side of the city in King of New York, as Frank often mingles with the politicians and power- players, but it is a world of black suits and orange lighting, and a world that shares the same depravity and sleaze as the lower-classes. It's a grim thing to see through Abel Ferrara's gaze, but boy is it brimming with atmosphere. This will always play second or third fiddle to the likes of Scarface (1983), but King of New York is the film the former could never be, and in its own depressing way, is a much better film. Undoubtedly Ferrara's finest, and most 'polished' work. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    A New York drug lord Frank White (Christopher Walken) is being driven in his limousine back into the city following his release from prison. His crew are busy taking out a rival Columbian gang who have been encroaching on White's business while he's been away. Once he's back White wastes no time in taking out more of New York's crime lords and cements himself as the King of New York. Disgruntled that they are never able to get charges to stick, a few wild Police Officers decide that the only way to stop White and his gang is to take them out. Featuring an impressive cast which alongside Walken includes gangsters Laurence Fishburne, Steve Buscemi, Giancarlo Esposito and Theresa Randle with Cops Wesley Snipes, Victor Argo and David Caruso the film is a tale of good vs evil, but as you'd expect the lines between the two are blurred. Although not in the same league as the likes of Scarface, Carlito's Way or Serpico all of which share themes with this, it is a decent gangster picture. The story is fairly basic really. Gang boss gets released from prison; starts to rebuild his empire and the cops try to stop him. There is little new plot wise. The only little twist on the genre is the cop's tactic of halting the gangster's operation. I wasn't really invested in the story or many of the characters though there were some good performances. Much like the plot they were all characters you've seen before to some degree or another. There's the level headed, ice cold killer of a boss, the ostentatious black gangsters, the Irish cops, the Latino middle man, the Mafioso, the Chinese Triads and various scantily clad women. Unfortunately it's all been seen and done before. As I say though there are some terrific performances. Christopher Walken delivers a powerful and menacing performance as Frank White. He's calm and calculating but isn't afraid to deliver the killer blow. The character also has a side to him which makes the audience empathize with him and the way in which Walken creates this is brilliant. Another great performance is Laurence Fishburne as an arrogant and flashy gangster/killer. He is especially good in the chicken shop scene. Victor Argo is also great. The highlight of the film for me was the incredible soundtrack. I have somewhat of a puncheon for late 80s Hip-Hop and this film features some of the best that era had to offer with the likes of Party Posse and Schooly D lending songs. The traditional score which is interspersed with the Hip-Hop works well and sounds good. As well as the soundtrack there was also some pretty jazzy dancing, most notably from Walken. It reminded me of the video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice, a video I could watch over and over again. In addition as the slightly tired plot another problem with the film is the hair. I've never seen such bad hair in a film before. Half the cast sport mullets and Christopher Walken's is characteristically crazy. I did enjoy the two big shoot-outs. They were both action packed and the first must have had some influence on Grand Theft Auto as it looked just like the sort of shoot-out that game would present. In the end King of New York is an average gangster film but nothing more. www.attheback.blogspot.com
