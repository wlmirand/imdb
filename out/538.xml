    I adore Disney's peak era animation films: The Lion King, The Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid. Anastasia, by Fox Studios, sets out to capture that same blockbusting brilliance, and achieves some of it. Anastasia has a strong visual look, headstrong protagonist, entertaining sidekicks and a memorable villain. The film isn't very original, the best stuff feels like a rehash of aforementioned Disney classics. The thing I like best is its realistic feel - the story takes place in 20th century Europe, not some faraway fairy kingdom. There is some magic connected to Rasputin, the bad guy, but it fits in the setting. The songs are alright. The ending has some pretty complex and emotional conflicts, not everything is black and white.

    Anastasia is not a Disney movie. From the first few minutes you'll recognize it's different atmosphere. The palace, the princess herself, everything is slightly different and yet it does not lack the beauty of a classic animated fairytale. You still have your princess, your villain and your talking animals. Dark Rasputin, character that has been used far too many times as the "bad guy" in the movies, Dimitri, who maybe has few faults but who is still pretty much perfect "prince charming" and, of course, the beautiful Anastasia, who with her wildness cannot be mistaken for a Disney princess. Anastasia's and Dimitri's chemistry on the screen is as strong as in any other feature film. The storyline does not have any plot holes or unresolved mysteries and is going so swimmingly that you will not notice the time till it's over. Nevertheless the most important thing in this story, thing this story is really build upon, is the music. Without good music the story would collapse like a house of cards. Fortunately it did not happen and the soundtrack just helps to shape the story into the brilliant masterpiece that it is. The songs are sometimes far from that naive melody you're used to in the Disney movies but it clearly does the movie good. The choices of the voices are excellent and even though I sometimes get annoyed by songs in movies it did not happened to me once in this movie. They will only stay with you if not for the rest of the week then at least for the rest of the day. In conclusion, this movie deserves to be seen and it will brighten your day any time.

    In the Russian revolution of 1817 the Czar of Russia was dethroned, sent into exile and, along with the rest of his family, murdered by Bolsheviks. Rasputin, an evil monk trusted by the family to cure their son, betrayed them and was instrumental in their downfall. But, over the years, rumours surfaced that the Czar's daughter Anastasia had survived the massacre that had claimed her parents, brothers and sisters, and it was hoped that she would one day return to the fold. You know what that story needs? Songs! Ohhhh, a 1, 2, 3, 4, life has been grim since the revolution, la la la de daaaaa! Disney wannabe Don Bluth then jollies things up further by making Rasputin a rotting corpse who spends the film falling to pieces and bantering with a comic relief bat. What's next, a cartoon adaptation of The Final Solution?

    Warning: Spoilers!!! I remember watching this movie as a child on a VHS, but because they are now outdated, I hadn't watched it for years. But it was not long ago I found it on Blu-Ray and bought it unsure whether or not I would find it as good a story as a did almost a decade ago. And I was not disappointed! I say ignore those people who only hate this movie because of its historical inaccuracy, I mean, is it really that important for a movie to be historically correct to be great movie? I hardly think so. I think this story line is in every way amazing! And because this was based on a true story, it encouraged me to research and read up on the real story of Anastasia. This movie is a masterpiece and clearly one of my favorites. The characters are all great in their respected roles and the one thing I particularly loved was that Anastasia, even though she found her family and remembered her past, she gave back the crown so she could be with the one she loved. How many other 'princesses' have done that?? It's a refreshing end! The songs are hauntingly beautiful - so beautiful I went out and bought the album. It's visually great to watch and even though some parts may be a bit scary for the younger audience, I would certainly recommend this as a must-watch! Such an excellent movie! I'd be watching this for many years to come!

    If I didn't know better, I would've assumed Anastasia was a Disney film. It perfectly duplicates the Disney formula, with nearly as much success. Containing all the ingredients of a superb Disney movie, Anastasia can't stack up with the best of animated fairy tales, but it's an enchanting film regardless. Anya has been an orphan from the age of eight. She knows nothing about herself, and is determined to find her family, whom she believes to be in Paris. And it seems she just might make it to Paris when two con men (Dimitri and Vladimir) volunteer to take her there, under the condition she pretends to be the lost princess of Russia, so that they can collect the reward money for finding her. Little do they know what Anya actually IS the lost princess. This is not a particularly original tale. The story has been told time and time again. And while Anastasia may still produce a sense of deja vu, it also manages to make the story feel fresh again. All of the best qualities of a good Disney movie are here, in just slightly inferior fashion. These qualities being: memorable characters, great songs, excellent animation. There are others too, but these are the qualities Anastasia best duplicates. Anastasia is a slightly snarky (but not annoying) damsel, that has much more personality than most other Disney princesses of the time. Dimitri is the scoundrel that (predictably) falls in love with the title character. Vladimir is a jolly and round man, who provides most of the film's humor. The villain, Rasputin, is wonderfully wicked, and has a nasty habit of falling apart at times. A hand here, an eye there, that sort of thing. The voice cast is good, without being quite great. The two standouts are Angela Lansbury as the Russian Empress, and Christopher Lloyd as the villain. The songs are marvelous, though the interesting rhyme schemes take some getting used to. "Journey to the Past" is a magical number, accompanied by great music and spellbinding lyrics. "Once Upon a December," this fairy tale's music box/lullaby song is pleasant, and could've been a spot on parody of any of Disney's songs of the same nature. "Rumor in St. Petersburg" is distinctly Russian, and at the same time, evokes memories of the "Belle" number in Beauty and the Beast (though it's not nearly as good). "In the Dark of the Night" is a fantastic villain's song, with some great accompanying chords and music that really make the song. And "Learn to Do It" is the film's most comedic and easily likable song, with quick clever lyrics (and includes a sweet reprise shortly afterwards). The animation is good, and almost great. There's lots of detail, and pretty good character designs. The main problem is that there's no sense of depth. This leads to some pretty cheap looking segments here and there that could've used some polish. Occasional use of CGI is subtle and not distracting, but enhances the animation. The score, composed by David Newman, has all the elements of a good fairy tale or fantasy score. It's not as playful as most Disney scores (appropriate for the film's slightly darker nature), but it certainly gets the job done. While I wouldn't put it ahead of most Disney Princess movies, Anastasia makes for a worthy rival. Great songs, memorable characters, and a touching story makes Anastasia a winner. I can't say I was expecting much from this Disney look-a-like, but you can call me impressed.

    I love this movie! The score is amazing! I have to laugh at all of the people giving bad reviews over historical accuracy. Let me explain something that may help you get beyond this. This is what is called a piece of historical fiction. In other words, they took the fact that there was once a grand duchess of Russia named Anastasia, and basically made up everything else around it. Nowhere does this movie indicate that it is supposed to be about Ana Anderson, the woman who claimed to be Anastasia (and was not). Yes, we all know Rasputin was not a rotting corpse, nor was he even still living at the time of the imperial family's abdication and murder. For goodness' sake, it's an animated fairy tale, not a historical documentary! Get over it. We all know Anastasia was murdered along with her family. And as for nit picking about linguistic accuracy, having a degree in foreign language, myself, I find it absolutely hilarious that someone mentioned several inaccuracies in pronunciation but never once mentioned that the name "Anastasia" is actually pronounced "ah-nah-STAH-see-ah." But once again, get over it for goodness' sake! This movie is fantastic if you can sit back and enjoy it for the fairy tale that it is and not get caught up in trying to criticize the fact that it is not real.

    Well, Don Bluth. Looks like you've found a way to make another successful film in your career. It's been a long time since you released such great family hits like "The Secret of NIMH" (avoid the god-awful sequel if you know what's good for you), "An American Tail", "The Land Before Time", and "All Dogs Go To Heaven" and even though your career later went downhill with new films like "Rock-A-Doodle", "Thumbelina", and "The Pebble and the Penguin", I've found them decent and watchable while A Troll in Central Park, although not a terrible movie, was in my opinion not a good film. Then, finally, you made a great comeback by competing with Disney yet again this time with another successful film "Anastasia" based on not only the historical event, but the 1956 movie as well. Before I begin this review, I want to say that I never saw the 1956 movie or read the historical event (I did learn it in class though, but I'm getting ahead of myself), but that doesn't take away the fact that I apparently loved this movie much like anyone else who grew up with it (So did I). I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but let me remind you that this is a children's movie since the violence from that event might be pretty graphic for younger kids. That's why Don Bluth decided to change all of that. Historical inaccuracies aside, I was enthralled by it's average, but magnificent animation and the character animation is decent. Not great, but still good. The characters themselves are well-developed. Anastasia (short-named Anya) is a likable protagonist and I liked her attempts to find out about her past. Dimitri is pretty good too with some great chemistry between him and Anastasia. Other characters including the hilarious comedic talking bat Bartok are likable as well, but the only character that I like the most is Rasputin who was by far a great non-Disney villains and is one of the most darkest ones yet along with some of Disney's villains. Even his dark magic sorcery is great which makes him very original. The story is dark, but not as dark as The Secret of NIMH and although, despite it's historical inaccuracies, it's at least good and the pacing never fails to amuse me, but the strongest aspect goes to the songs/music from David Newman with some great haunting and melodic tunes including "Once Upon a December" "Journey to the Past", "In The Dark of the Night" and more and the voice acting with some great talents like Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Angela Lansbury, Hank Azaria, and Christopher Lloyd since they fitted the characters very well throughout the entire film. Anastasia is this close to becoming a masterpiece of animation. I know lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but as an animation fan, I'm recommending this to others highly as one of Bluth's best works yet. It's also great to see that it made lots of money at the box office. Thumbs up from me!

    you know that movie from your childhood you can recite word for word? this is my movie like that. the live action version is very similar from the 50's. i love history and this movie has made that stronger. i even have the music box. i would love a replica of her necklace. this movie has so many of my favorite actors in it and my driving force to visit the palace one day. i love this movie so much it always gives me a dreamy feel. the songs are amazing. i just wish it had been more popular. gorgeous animation in it. a mix of cg and story board with such detail. even the prince for the princess is amazing. a con artist willing to give up money for his love. i used to dream of a guy like him now didn't happen.

    Well, Don Bluth. Looks like you've found a way to make another successful film in your career. It's been a long time since you released such great family hits like "The Secret of NIMH" (avoid the god-awful sequel if you know what's good for you), "An American Tail", "The Land Before Time", and "All Dogs Go To Heaven" and even though your career later went downhill with new films like "Rock-A-Doodle", "Thumbelina", and "The Pebble and the Penguin", I've found them decent and watchable while A Troll in Central Park, although not a terrible movie, was in my opinion not a good film. Then, finally, you made a great comeback by competing with Disney yet again this time with another successful film "Anastasia" based on not only the historical event, but the 1956 movie as well. Before I begin this review, I want to say that I never saw the 1956 movie or read the historical event (I did learn it in class though, but I'm getting ahead of myself), but that doesn't take away the fact that I apparently loved this movie much like anyone else who grew up with it (So did I). I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but let me remind you that this is a children's movie since the violence from that event might be pretty graphic for younger kids. That's why Don Bluth decided to change all of that. Historical inaccuracies aside, I was enthralled by it's average, but magnificent animation and the character animation is decent. Not great, but still good. The characters themselves are well-developed. Anastasia (short-named Anya) is a likable protagonist and I liked her attempts to find out about her past. Dimitri is pretty good too with some great chemistry between him and Anastasia. Other characters including the hilarious comedic talking bat Bartok are likable as well, but the only character that I like the most is Rasputin who was by far a great non-Disney villains and is one of the most darkest ones yet along with some of Disney's villains. Even his dark magic sorcery is great which makes him very original. The story is dark, but not as dark as The Secret of NIMH and although, despite it's historical inaccuracies, it's at least good and the pacing never fails to amuse me, but the strongest aspect goes to the songs/music from David Newman with some great haunting and melodic tunes including "Once Upon a December" "Journey to the Past", "In The Dark of the Night" and more and the voice acting with some great talents like Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Angela Lansbury, Hank Azaria, and Christopher Lloyd since they fitted the characters very well throughout the entire film. Anastasia is this close to becoming a masterpiece of animation. I know lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but as an animation fan, I'm recommending this to others highly as one of Bluth's best works yet. It's also great to see that it made lots of money at the box office. Thumbs up from me!

    you know that movie from your childhood you can recite word for word? this is my movie like that. the live action version is very similar from the 50's. i love history and this movie has made that stronger. i even have the music box. i would love a replica of her necklace. this movie has so many of my favorite actors in it and my driving force to visit the palace one day. i love this movie so much it always gives me a dreamy feel. the songs are amazing. i just wish it had been more popular. gorgeous animation in it. a mix of cg and story board with such detail. even the prince for the princess is amazing. a con artist willing to give up money for his love. i used to dream of a guy like him now didn't happen.

    I adore Disney's peak era animation films: The Lion King, The Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid. Anastasia, by Fox Studios, sets out to capture that same blockbusting brilliance, and achieves some of it. Anastasia has a strong visual look, headstrong protagonist, entertaining sidekicks and a memorable villain. The film isn't very original, the best stuff feels like a rehash of aforementioned Disney classics. The thing I like best is its realistic feel - the story takes place in 20th century Europe, not some faraway fairy kingdom. There is some magic connected to Rasputin, the bad guy, but it fits in the setting. The songs are alright. The ending has some pretty complex and emotional conflicts, not everything is black and white.

    Anastasia is not a Disney movie. From the first few minutes you'll recognize it's different atmosphere. The palace, the princess herself, everything is slightly different and yet it does not lack the beauty of a classic animated fairytale. You still have your princess, your villain and your talking animals. Dark Rasputin, character that has been used far too many times as the "bad guy" in the movies, Dimitri, who maybe has few faults but who is still pretty much perfect "prince charming" and, of course, the beautiful Anastasia, who with her wildness cannot be mistaken for a Disney princess. Anastasia's and Dimitri's chemistry on the screen is as strong as in any other feature film. The storyline does not have any plot holes or unresolved mysteries and is going so swimmingly that you will not notice the time till it's over. Nevertheless the most important thing in this story, thing this story is really build upon, is the music. Without good music the story would collapse like a house of cards. Fortunately it did not happen and the soundtrack just helps to shape the story into the brilliant masterpiece that it is. The songs are sometimes far from that naive melody you're used to in the Disney movies but it clearly does the movie good. The choices of the voices are excellent and even though I sometimes get annoyed by songs in movies it did not happened to me once in this movie. They will only stay with you if not for the rest of the week then at least for the rest of the day. In conclusion, this movie deserves to be seen and it will brighten your day any time.

    In the Russian revolution of 1817 the Czar of Russia was dethroned, sent into exile and, along with the rest of his family, murdered by Bolsheviks. Rasputin, an evil monk trusted by the family to cure their son, betrayed them and was instrumental in their downfall. But, over the years, rumours surfaced that the Czar's daughter Anastasia had survived the massacre that had claimed her parents, brothers and sisters, and it was hoped that she would one day return to the fold. You know what that story needs? Songs! Ohhhh, a 1, 2, 3, 4, life has been grim since the revolution, la la la de daaaaa! Disney wannabe Don Bluth then jollies things up further by making Rasputin a rotting corpse who spends the film falling to pieces and bantering with a comic relief bat. What's next, a cartoon adaptation of The Final Solution?

    Warning: Spoilers!!! I remember watching this movie as a child on a VHS, but because they are now outdated, I hadn't watched it for years. But it was not long ago I found it on Blu-Ray and bought it unsure whether or not I would find it as good a story as a did almost a decade ago. And I was not disappointed! I say ignore those people who only hate this movie because of its historical inaccuracy, I mean, is it really that important for a movie to be historically correct to be great movie? I hardly think so. I think this story line is in every way amazing! And because this was based on a true story, it encouraged me to research and read up on the real story of Anastasia. This movie is a masterpiece and clearly one of my favorites. The characters are all great in their respected roles and the one thing I particularly loved was that Anastasia, even though she found her family and remembered her past, she gave back the crown so she could be with the one she loved. How many other 'princesses' have done that?? It's a refreshing end! The songs are hauntingly beautiful - so beautiful I went out and bought the album. It's visually great to watch and even though some parts may be a bit scary for the younger audience, I would certainly recommend this as a must-watch! Such an excellent movie! I'd be watching this for many years to come!

    If I didn't know better, I would've assumed Anastasia was a Disney film. It perfectly duplicates the Disney formula, with nearly as much success. Containing all the ingredients of a superb Disney movie, Anastasia can't stack up with the best of animated fairy tales, but it's an enchanting film regardless. Anya has been an orphan from the age of eight. She knows nothing about herself, and is determined to find her family, whom she believes to be in Paris. And it seems she just might make it to Paris when two con men (Dimitri and Vladimir) volunteer to take her there, under the condition she pretends to be the lost princess of Russia, so that they can collect the reward money for finding her. Little do they know what Anya actually IS the lost princess. This is not a particularly original tale. The story has been told time and time again. And while Anastasia may still produce a sense of deja vu, it also manages to make the story feel fresh again. All of the best qualities of a good Disney movie are here, in just slightly inferior fashion. These qualities being: memorable characters, great songs, excellent animation. There are others too, but these are the qualities Anastasia best duplicates. Anastasia is a slightly snarky (but not annoying) damsel, that has much more personality than most other Disney princesses of the time. Dimitri is the scoundrel that (predictably) falls in love with the title character. Vladimir is a jolly and round man, who provides most of the film's humor. The villain, Rasputin, is wonderfully wicked, and has a nasty habit of falling apart at times. A hand here, an eye there, that sort of thing. The voice cast is good, without being quite great. The two standouts are Angela Lansbury as the Russian Empress, and Christopher Lloyd as the villain. The songs are marvelous, though the interesting rhyme schemes take some getting used to. "Journey to the Past" is a magical number, accompanied by great music and spellbinding lyrics. "Once Upon a December," this fairy tale's music box/lullaby song is pleasant, and could've been a spot on parody of any of Disney's songs of the same nature. "Rumor in St. Petersburg" is distinctly Russian, and at the same time, evokes memories of the "Belle" number in Beauty and the Beast (though it's not nearly as good). "In the Dark of the Night" is a fantastic villain's song, with some great accompanying chords and music that really make the song. And "Learn to Do It" is the film's most comedic and easily likable song, with quick clever lyrics (and includes a sweet reprise shortly afterwards). The animation is good, and almost great. There's lots of detail, and pretty good character designs. The main problem is that there's no sense of depth. This leads to some pretty cheap looking segments here and there that could've used some polish. Occasional use of CGI is subtle and not distracting, but enhances the animation. The score, composed by David Newman, has all the elements of a good fairy tale or fantasy score. It's not as playful as most Disney scores (appropriate for the film's slightly darker nature), but it certainly gets the job done. While I wouldn't put it ahead of most Disney Princess movies, Anastasia makes for a worthy rival. Great songs, memorable characters, and a touching story makes Anastasia a winner. I can't say I was expecting much from this Disney look-a-like, but you can call me impressed.

    I love this movie! The score is amazing! I have to laugh at all of the people giving bad reviews over historical accuracy. Let me explain something that may help you get beyond this. This is what is called a piece of historical fiction. In other words, they took the fact that there was once a grand duchess of Russia named Anastasia, and basically made up everything else around it. Nowhere does this movie indicate that it is supposed to be about Ana Anderson, the woman who claimed to be Anastasia (and was not). Yes, we all know Rasputin was not a rotting corpse, nor was he even still living at the time of the imperial family's abdication and murder. For goodness' sake, it's an animated fairy tale, not a historical documentary! Get over it. We all know Anastasia was murdered along with her family. And as for nit picking about linguistic accuracy, having a degree in foreign language, myself, I find it absolutely hilarious that someone mentioned several inaccuracies in pronunciation but never once mentioned that the name "Anastasia" is actually pronounced "ah-nah-STAH-see-ah." But once again, get over it for goodness' sake! This movie is fantastic if you can sit back and enjoy it for the fairy tale that it is and not get caught up in trying to criticize the fact that it is not real.

    I can't remember exactly the first time I saw the movie. I mean, I've had it on VHS since I could remember. I guess I've just been watching it since then. The movie is quite a masterpiece. The script, the plot, the music. Gosh, I love the music. I swear that I never get tired of watching it. In my opinion, it's my most favorite cartoon musical yet. I also enjoyed the romance. It was perfect. Love at first sight, and a good, happy ending that nobody expects. Even the actors and actresses who voiced the characters were perfect and unique, it's what really made the movie beside the plot and music. I love how classic the graphics are.

    I've watched this movie forever, and it's always been one of my favorites. Over the past year, I became interested in the true story of the Romanov family, and if you're looking for a historically accurate movie, I don't recommend it, but if you want a heartwarming, cuddle-up-in-a-pile-of-blankets movie, this is 100% it. My favorite part is when Anastasia and her grandmother are talking in her room. I always cry, and this is the only movie that will make me cry every time I watch it. This is a magical movie, that I will cherish forever.

This movie is fantastic if you can sit back and enjoy it for the fairy tale that it is and not get caught up in trying to criticize the fact that it is not real.

    I can't remember exactly the first time I saw the movie. I mean, I've had it on VHS since I could remember. I guess I've just been watching it since then. The movie is quite a masterpiece. The script, the plot, the music. Gosh, I love the music. I swear that I never get tired of watching it. In my opinion, it's my most favorite cartoon musical yet. I also enjoyed the romance. It was perfect. Love at first sight, and a good, happy ending that nobody expects. Even the actors and actresses who voiced the characters were perfect and unique, it's what really made the movie beside the plot and music. I love how classic the graphics are.

    I've watched this movie forever, and it's always been one of my favorites. Over the past year, I became interested in the true story of the Romanov family, and if you're looking for a historically accurate movie, I don't recommend it, but if you want a heartwarming, cuddle-up-in-a-pile-of-blankets movie, this is 100% it. My favorite part is when Anastasia and her grandmother are talking in her room. I always cry, and this is the only movie that will make me cry every time I watch it. This is a magical movie, that I will cherish forever.

    Well, Don Bluth. Looks like you've found a way to make another successful film in your career. It's been a long time since you released such great family hits like "The Secret of NIMH" (avoid the god-awful sequel if you know what's good for you), "An American Tail", "The Land Before Time", and "All Dogs Go To Heaven" and even though your career later went downhill with new films like "Rock-A-Doodle", "Thumbelina", and "The Pebble and the Penguin", I've found them decent and watchable while A Troll in Central Park, although not a terrible movie, was in my opinion not a good film. Then, finally, you made a great comeback by competing with Disney yet again this time with another successful film "Anastasia" based on not only the historical event, but the 1956 movie as well. Before I begin this review, I want to say that I never saw the 1956 movie or read the historical event (I did learn it in class though, but I'm getting ahead of myself), but that doesn't take away the fact that I apparently loved this movie much like anyone else who grew up with it (So did I). I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but let me remind you that this is a children's movie since the violence from that event might be pretty graphic for younger kids. That's why Don Bluth decided to change all of that. Historical inaccuracies aside, I was enthralled by it's average, but magnificent animation and the character animation is decent. Not great, but still good. The characters themselves are well-developed. Anastasia (short-named Anya) is a likable protagonist and I liked her attempts to find out about her past. Dimitri is pretty good too with some great chemistry between him and Anastasia. Other characters including the hilarious comedic talking bat Bartok are likable as well, but the only character that I like the most is Rasputin who was by far a great non-Disney villains and is one of the most darkest ones yet along with some of Disney's villains. Even his dark magic sorcery is great which makes him very original. The story is dark, but not as dark as The Secret of NIMH and although, despite it's historical inaccuracies, it's at least good and the pacing never fails to amuse me, but the strongest aspect goes to the songs/music from David Newman with some great haunting and melodic tunes including "Once Upon a December" "Journey to the Past", "In The Dark of the Night" and more and the voice acting with some great talents like Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Angela Lansbury, Hank Azaria, and Christopher Lloyd since they fitted the characters very well throughout the entire film. Anastasia is this close to becoming a masterpiece of animation. I know lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but as an animation fan, I'm recommending this to others highly as one of Bluth's best works yet. It's also great to see that it made lots of money at the box office. Thumbs up from me!

    you know that movie from your childhood you can recite word for word? this is my movie like that. the live action version is very similar from the 50's. i love history and this movie has made that stronger. i even have the music box. i would love a replica of her necklace. this movie has so many of my favorite actors in it and my driving force to visit the palace one day. i love this movie so much it always gives me a dreamy feel. the songs are amazing. i just wish it had been more popular. gorgeous animation in it. a mix of cg and story board with such detail. even the prince for the princess is amazing. a con artist willing to give up money for his love. i used to dream of a guy like him now didn't happen.

    I adore Disney's peak era animation films: The Lion King, The Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid. Anastasia, by Fox Studios, sets out to capture that same blockbusting brilliance, and achieves some of it. Anastasia has a strong visual look, headstrong protagonist, entertaining sidekicks and a memorable villain. The film isn't very original, the best stuff feels like a rehash of aforementioned Disney classics. The thing I like best is its realistic feel - the story takes place in 20th century Europe, not some faraway fairy kingdom. There is some magic connected to Rasputin, the bad guy, but it fits in the setting. The songs are alright. The ending has some pretty complex and emotional conflicts, not everything is black and white.

    Anastasia is not a Disney movie. From the first few minutes you'll recognize it's different atmosphere. The palace, the princess herself, everything is slightly different and yet it does not lack the beauty of a classic animated fairytale. You still have your princess, your villain and your talking animals. Dark Rasputin, character that has been used far too many times as the "bad guy" in the movies, Dimitri, who maybe has few faults but who is still pretty much perfect "prince charming" and, of course, the beautiful Anastasia, who with her wildness cannot be mistaken for a Disney princess. Anastasia's and Dimitri's chemistry on the screen is as strong as in any other feature film. The storyline does not have any plot holes or unresolved mysteries and is going so swimmingly that you will not notice the time till it's over. Nevertheless the most important thing in this story, thing this story is really build upon, is the music. Without good music the story would collapse like a house of cards. Fortunately it did not happen and the soundtrack just helps to shape the story into the brilliant masterpiece that it is. The songs are sometimes far from that naive melody you're used to in the Disney movies but it clearly does the movie good. The choices of the voices are excellent and even though I sometimes get annoyed by songs in movies it did not happened to me once in this movie. They will only stay with you if not for the rest of the week then at least for the rest of the day. In conclusion, this movie deserves to be seen and it will brighten your day any time.

    In the Russian revolution of 1817 the Czar of Russia was dethroned, sent into exile and, along with the rest of his family, murdered by Bolsheviks. Rasputin, an evil monk trusted by the family to cure their son, betrayed them and was instrumental in their downfall. But, over the years, rumours surfaced that the Czar's daughter Anastasia had survived the massacre that had claimed her parents, brothers and sisters, and it was hoped that she would one day return to the fold. You know what that story needs? Songs! Ohhhh, a 1, 2, 3, 4, life has been grim since the revolution, la la la de daaaaa! Disney wannabe Don Bluth then jollies things up further by making Rasputin a rotting corpse who spends the film falling to pieces and bantering with a comic relief bat. What's next, a cartoon adaptation of The Final Solution?

    Warning: Spoilers!!! I remember watching this movie as a child on a VHS, but because they are now outdated, I hadn't watched it for years. But it was not long ago I found it on Blu-Ray and bought it unsure whether or not I would find it as good a story as a did almost a decade ago. And I was not disappointed! I say ignore those people who only hate this movie because of its historical inaccuracy, I mean, is it really that important for a movie to be historically correct to be great movie? I hardly think so. I think this story line is in every way amazing! And because this was based on a true story, it encouraged me to research and read up on the real story of Anastasia. This movie is a masterpiece and clearly one of my favorites. The characters are all great in their respected roles and the one thing I particularly loved was that Anastasia, even though she found her family and remembered her past, she gave back the crown so she could be with the one she loved. How many other 'princesses' have done that?? It's a refreshing end! The songs are hauntingly beautiful - so beautiful I went out and bought the album. It's visually great to watch and even though some parts may be a bit scary for the younger audience, I would certainly recommend this as a must-watch! Such an excellent movie! I'd be watching this for many years to come!

    If I didn't know better, I would've assumed Anastasia was a Disney film. It perfectly duplicates the Disney formula, with nearly as much success. Containing all the ingredients of a superb Disney movie, Anastasia can't stack up with the best of animated fairy tales, but it's an enchanting film regardless. Anya has been an orphan from the age of eight. She knows nothing about herself, and is determined to find her family, whom she believes to be in Paris. And it seems she just might make it to Paris when two con men (Dimitri and Vladimir) volunteer to take her there, under the condition she pretends to be the lost princess of Russia, so that they can collect the reward money for finding her. Little do they know what Anya actually IS the lost princess. This is not a particularly original tale. The story has been told time and time again. And while Anastasia may still produce a sense of deja vu, it also manages to make the story feel fresh again. All of the best qualities of a good Disney movie are here, in just slightly inferior fashion. These qualities being: memorable characters, great songs, excellent animation. There are others too, but these are the qualities Anastasia best duplicates. Anastasia is a slightly snarky (but not annoying) damsel, that has much more personality than most other Disney princesses of the time. Dimitri is the scoundrel that (predictably) falls in love with the title character. Vladimir is a jolly and round man, who provides most of the film's humor. The villain, Rasputin, is wonderfully wicked, and has a nasty habit of falling apart at times. A hand here, an eye there, that sort of thing. The voice cast is good, without being quite great. The two standouts are Angela Lansbury as the Russian Empress, and Christopher Lloyd as the villain. The songs are marvelous, though the interesting rhyme schemes take some getting used to. "Journey to the Past" is a magical number, accompanied by great music and spellbinding lyrics. "Once Upon a December," this fairy tale's music box/lullaby song is pleasant, and could've been a spot on parody of any of Disney's songs of the same nature. "Rumor in St. Petersburg" is distinctly Russian, and at the same time, evokes memories of the "Belle" number in Beauty and the Beast (though it's not nearly as good). "In the Dark of the Night" is a fantastic villain's song, with some great accompanying chords and music that really make the song. And "Learn to Do It" is the film's most comedic and easily likable song, with quick clever lyrics (and includes a sweet reprise shortly afterwards). The animation is good, and almost great. There's lots of detail, and pretty good character designs. The main problem is that there's no sense of depth. This leads to some pretty cheap looking segments here and there that could've used some polish. Occasional use of CGI is subtle and not distracting, but enhances the animation. The score, composed by David Newman, has all the elements of a good fairy tale or fantasy score. It's not as playful as most Disney scores (appropriate for the film's slightly darker nature), but it certainly gets the job done. While I wouldn't put it ahead of most Disney Princess movies, Anastasia makes for a worthy rival. Great songs, memorable characters, and a touching story makes Anastasia a winner. I can't say I was expecting much from this Disney look-a-like, but you can call me impressed.

    I love this movie! The score is amazing! I have to laugh at all of the people giving bad reviews over historical accuracy. Let me explain something that may help you get beyond this. This is what is called a piece of historical fiction. In other words, they took the fact that there was once a grand duchess of Russia named Anastasia, and basically made up everything else around it. Nowhere does this movie indicate that it is supposed to be about Ana Anderson, the woman who claimed to be Anastasia (and was not). Yes, we all know Rasputin was not a rotting corpse, nor was he even still living at the time of the imperial family's abdication and murder. For goodness' sake, it's an animated fairy tale, not a historical documentary! Get over it. We all know Anastasia was murdered along with her family. And as for nit picking about linguistic accuracy, having a degree in foreign language, myself, I find it absolutely hilarious that someone mentioned several inaccuracies in pronunciation but never once mentioned that the name "Anastasia" is actually pronounced "ah-nah-STAH-see-ah." But once again, get over it for goodness' sake! This movie is fantastic if you can sit back and enjoy it for the fairy tale that it is and not get caught up in trying to criticize the fact that it is not real.

"In the Dark of the Night" is a fantastic villain's song, with some great accompanying chords and music that really make the song. And "Learn to Do It" is the film's most comedic and easily likable song, with quick clever lyrics (and includes a sweet reprise shortly afterwards). The animation is good, and almost great. There's lots of detail, and pretty good character designs. The main problem is that there's no sense of depth. This leads to some pretty cheap looking segments here and there that could've used some polish. Occasional use of CGI is subtle and not distracting, but enhances the animation. The score, composed by David Newman, has all the elements of a good fairy tale or fantasy score. It's not as playful as most Disney scores (appropriate for the film's slightly darker nature), but it certainly gets the job done. While I wouldn't put it ahead of most Disney Princess movies, Anastasia makes for a worthy rival. Great songs, memorable characters, and a touching story makes Anastasia a winner. I can't say I was expecting much from this Disney look-a-like, but you can call me impressed.

    I love this movie! The score is amazing! I have to laugh at all of the people giving bad reviews over historical accuracy. Let me explain something that may help you get beyond this. This is what is called a piece of historical fiction. In other words, they took the fact that there was once a grand duchess of Russia named Anastasia, and basically made up everything else around it. Nowhere does this movie indicate that it is supposed to be about Ana Anderson, the woman who claimed to be Anastasia (and was not). Yes, we all know Rasputin was not a rotting corpse, nor was he even still living at the time of the imperial family's abdication and murder. For goodness' sake, it's an animated fairy tale, not a historical documentary! Get over it. We all know Anastasia was murdered along with her family. And as for nit picking about linguistic accuracy, having a degree in foreign language, myself, I find it absolutely hilarious that someone mentioned several inaccuracies in pronunciation but never once mentioned that the name "Anastasia" is actually pronounced "ah-nah-STAH-see-ah." But once again, get over it for goodness' sake! This movie is fantastic if you can sit back and enjoy it for the fairy tale that it is and not get caught up in trying to criticize the fact that it is not real.

    I can't remember exactly the first time I saw the movie. I mean, I've had it on VHS since I could remember. I guess I've just been watching it since then. The movie is quite a masterpiece. The script, the plot, the music. Gosh, I love the music. I swear that I never get tired of watching it. In my opinion, it's my most favorite cartoon musical yet. I also enjoyed the romance. It was perfect. Love at first sight, and a good, happy ending that nobody expects. Even the actors and actresses who voiced the characters were perfect and unique, it's what really made the movie beside the plot and music. I love how classic the graphics are.

    I've watched this movie forever, and it's always been one of my favorites. Over the past year, I became interested in the true story of the Romanov family, and if you're looking for a historically accurate movie, I don't recommend it, but if you want a heartwarming, cuddle-up-in-a-pile-of-blankets movie, this is 100% it. My favorite part is when Anastasia and her grandmother are talking in her room. I always cry, and this is the only movie that will make me cry every time I watch it. This is a magical movie, that I will cherish forever.

    Well, Don Bluth. Looks like you've found a way to make another successful film in your career. It's been a long time since you released such great family hits like "The Secret of NIMH" (avoid the god-awful sequel if you know what's good for you), "An American Tail", "The Land Before Time", and "All Dogs Go To Heaven" and even though your career later went downhill with new films like "Rock-A-Doodle", "Thumbelina", and "The Pebble and the Penguin", I've found them decent and watchable while A Troll in Central Park, although not a terrible movie, was in my opinion not a good film. Then, finally, you made a great comeback by competing with Disney yet again this time with another successful film "Anastasia" based on not only the historical event, but the 1956 movie as well. Before I begin this review, I want to say that I never saw the 1956 movie or read the historical event (I did learn it in class though, but I'm getting ahead of myself), but that doesn't take away the fact that I apparently loved this movie much like anyone else who grew up with it (So did I). I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but let me remind you that this is a children's movie since the violence from that event might be pretty graphic for younger kids. That's why Don Bluth decided to change all of that. Historical inaccuracies aside, I was enthralled by it's average, but magnificent animation and the character animation is decent. Not great, but still good. The characters themselves are well-developed. Anastasia (short-named Anya) is a likable protagonist and I liked her attempts to find out about her past. Dimitri is pretty good too with some great chemistry between him and Anastasia. Other characters including the hilarious comedic talking bat Bartok are likable as well, but the only character that I like the most is Rasputin who was by far a great non-Disney villains and is one of the most darkest ones yet along with some of Disney's villains. Even his dark magic sorcery is great which makes him very original. The story is dark, but not as dark as The Secret of NIMH and although, despite it's historical inaccuracies, it's at least good and the pacing never fails to amuse me, but the strongest aspect goes to the songs/music from David Newman with some great haunting and melodic tunes including "Once Upon a December" "Journey to the Past", "In The Dark of the Night" and more and the voice acting with some great talents like Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Angela Lansbury, Hank Azaria, and Christopher Lloyd since they fitted the characters very well throughout the entire film. Anastasia is this close to becoming a masterpiece of animation. I know lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but as an animation fan, I'm recommending this to others highly as one of Bluth's best works yet. It's also great to see that it made lots of money at the box office. Thumbs up from me!

    I adore Disney's peak era animation films: The Lion King, The Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid. Anastasia, by Fox Studios, sets out to capture that same blockbusting brilliance, and achieves some of it. Anastasia has a strong visual look, headstrong protagonist, entertaining sidekicks and a memorable villain. The film isn't very original, the best stuff feels like a rehash of aforementioned Disney classics. The thing I like best is its realistic feel - the story takes place in 20th century Europe, not some faraway fairy kingdom. There is some magic connected to Rasputin, the bad guy, but it fits in the setting. The songs are alright. The ending has some pretty complex and emotional conflicts, not everything is black and white.

    Anastasia is not a Disney movie. From the first few minutes you'll recognize it's different atmosphere. The palace, the princess herself, everything is slightly different and yet it does not lack the beauty of a classic animated fairytale. You still have your princess, your villain and your talking animals. Dark Rasputin, character that has been used far too many times as the "bad guy" in the movies, Dimitri, who maybe has few faults but who is still pretty much perfect "prince charming" and, of course, the beautiful Anastasia, who with her wildness cannot be mistaken for a Disney princess. Anastasia's and Dimitri's chemistry on the screen is as strong as in any other feature film. The storyline does not have any plot holes or unresolved mysteries and is going so swimmingly that you will not notice the time till it's over. Nevertheless the most important thing in this story, thing this story is really build upon, is the music. Without good music the story would collapse like a house of cards. Fortunately it did not happen and the soundtrack just helps to shape the story into the brilliant masterpiece that it is. The songs are sometimes far from that naive melody you're used to in the Disney movies but it clearly does the movie good. The choices of the voices are excellent and even though I sometimes get annoyed by songs in movies it did not happened to me once in this movie. They will only stay with you if not for the rest of the week then at least for the rest of the day. In conclusion, this movie deserves to be seen and it will brighten your day any time.

    In the Russian revolution of 1817 the Czar of Russia was dethroned, sent into exile and, along with the rest of his family, murdered by Bolsheviks. Rasputin, an evil monk trusted by the family to cure their son, betrayed them and was instrumental in their downfall. But, over the years, rumours surfaced that the Czar's daughter Anastasia had survived the massacre that had claimed her parents, brothers and sisters, and it was hoped that she would one day return to the fold. You know what that story needs? Songs! Ohhhh, a 1, 2, 3, 4, life has been grim since the revolution, la la la de daaaaa! Disney wannabe Don Bluth then jollies things up further by making Rasputin a rotting corpse who spends the film falling to pieces and bantering with a comic relief bat. What's next, a cartoon adaptation of The Final Solution?

    Warning: Spoilers!!! I remember watching this movie as a child on a VHS, but because they are now outdated, I hadn't watched it for years. But it was not long ago I found it on Blu-Ray and bought it unsure whether or not I would find it as good a story as a did almost a decade ago. And I was not disappointed! I say ignore those people who only hate this movie because of its historical inaccuracy, I mean, is it really that important for a movie to be historically correct to be great movie? I hardly think so. I think this story line is in every way amazing! And because this was based on a true story, it encouraged me to research and read up on the real story of Anastasia. This movie is a masterpiece and clearly one of my favorites. The characters are all great in their respected roles and the one thing I particularly loved was that Anastasia, even though she found her family and remembered her past, she gave back the crown so she could be with the one she loved. How many other 'princesses' have done that?? It's a refreshing end! The songs are hauntingly beautiful - so beautiful I went out and bought the album. It's visually great to watch and even though some parts may be a bit scary for the younger audience, I would certainly recommend this as a must-watch! Such an excellent movie! I'd be watching this for many years to come!

    If I didn't know better, I would've assumed Anastasia was a Disney film. It perfectly duplicates the Disney formula, with nearly as much success. Containing all the ingredients of a superb Disney movie, Anastasia can't stack up with the best of animated fairy tales, but it's an enchanting film regardless. Anya has been an orphan from the age of eight. She knows nothing about herself, and is determined to find her family, whom she believes to be in Paris. And it seems she just might make it to Paris when two con men (Dimitri and Vladimir) volunteer to take her there, under the condition she pretends to be the lost princess of Russia, so that they can collect the reward money for finding her. Little do they know what Anya actually IS the lost princess. This is not a particularly original tale. The story has been told time and time again. And while Anastasia may still produce a sense of deja vu, it also manages to make the story feel fresh again. All of the best qualities of a good Disney movie are here, in just slightly inferior fashion. These qualities being: memorable characters, great songs, excellent animation. There are others too, but these are the qualities Anastasia best duplicates. Anastasia is a slightly snarky (but not annoying) damsel, that has much more personality than most other Disney princesses of the time. Dimitri is the scoundrel that (predictably) falls in love with the title character. Vladimir is a jolly and round man, who provides most of the film's humor. The villain, Rasputin, is wonderfully wicked, and has a nasty habit of falling apart at times. A hand here, an eye there, that sort of thing. The voice cast is good, without being quite great. The two standouts are Angela Lansbury as the Russian Empress, and Christopher Lloyd as the villain. The songs are marvelous, though the interesting rhyme schemes take some getting used to. "Journey to the Past" is a magical number, accompanied by great music and spellbinding lyrics. "Once Upon a December," this fairy tale's music box/lullaby song is pleasant, and could've been a spot on parody of any of Disney's songs of the same nature. "Rumor in St. Petersburg" is distinctly Russian, and at the same time, evokes memories of the "Belle" number in Beauty and the Beast (though it's not nearly as good). "In the Dark of the Night" is a fantastic villain's song, with some great accompanying chords and music that really make the song. And "Learn to Do It" is the film's most comedic and easily likable song, with quick clever lyrics (and includes a sweet reprise shortly afterwards). The animation is good, and almost great. There's lots of detail, and pretty good character designs. The main problem is that there's no sense of depth. This leads to some pretty cheap looking segments here and there that could've used some polish. Occasional use of CGI is subtle and not distracting, but enhances the animation. The score, composed by David Newman, has all the elements of a good fairy tale or fantasy score. It's not as playful as most Disney scores (appropriate for the film's slightly darker nature), but it certainly gets the job done. While I wouldn't put it ahead of most Disney Princess movies, Anastasia makes for a worthy rival. Great songs, memorable characters, and a touching story makes Anastasia a winner. I can't say I was expecting much from this Disney look-a-like, but you can call me impressed.

    If I didn't know better, I would've assumed Anastasia was a Disney film. It perfectly duplicates the Disney formula, with nearly as much success. Containing all the ingredients of a superb Disney movie, Anastasia can't stack up with the best of animated fairy tales, but it's an enchanting film regardless. Anya has been an orphan from the age of eight. She knows nothing about herself, and is determined to find her family, whom she believes to be in Paris. And it seems she just might make it to Paris when two con men (Dimitri and Vladimir) volunteer to take her there, under the condition she pretends to be the lost princess of Russia, so that they can collect the reward money for finding her. Little do they know what Anya actually IS the lost princess. This is not a particularly original tale. The story has been told time and time again. And while Anastasia may still produce a sense of deja vu, it also manages to make the story feel fresh again. All of the best qualities of a good Disney movie are here, in just slightly inferior fashion. These qualities being: memorable characters, great songs, excellent animation. There are others too, but these are the qualities Anastasia best duplicates. Anastasia is a slightly snarky (but not annoying) damsel, that has much more personality than most other Disney princesses of the time. Dimitri is the scoundrel that (predictably) falls in love with the title character. Vladimir is a jolly and round man, who provides most of the film's humor. The villain, Rasputin, is wonderfully wicked, and has a nasty habit of falling apart at times. A hand here, an eye there, that sort of thing. The voice cast is good, without being quite great. The two standouts are Angela Lansbury as the Russian Empress, and Christopher Lloyd as the villain. The songs are marvelous, though the interesting rhyme schemes take some getting used to. "Journey to the Past" is a magical number, accompanied by great music and spellbinding lyrics. "Once Upon a December," this fairy tale's music box/lullaby song is pleasant, and could've been a spot on parody of any of Disney's songs of the same nature. "Rumor in St. Petersburg" is distinctly Russian, and at the same time, evokes memories of the "Belle" number in Beauty and the Beast (though it's not nearly as good). "In the Dark of the Night" is a fantastic villain's song, with some great accompanying chords and music that really make the song. And "Learn to Do It" is the film's most comedic and easily likable song, with quick clever lyrics (and includes a sweet reprise shortly afterwards). The animation is good, and almost great. There's lots of detail, and pretty good character designs. The main problem is that there's no sense of depth. This leads to some pretty cheap looking segments here and there that could've used some polish. Occasional use of CGI is subtle and not distracting, but enhances the animation. The score, composed by David Newman, has all the elements of a good fairy tale or fantasy score. It's not as playful as most Disney scores (appropriate for the film's slightly darker nature), but it certainly gets the job done. While I wouldn't put it ahead of most Disney Princess movies, Anastasia makes for a worthy rival. Great songs, memorable characters, and a touching story makes Anastasia a winner. I can't say I was expecting much from this Disney look-a-like, but you can call me impressed.

    I love this movie! The score is amazing! I have to laugh at all of the people giving bad reviews over historical accuracy. Let me explain something that may help you get beyond this. This is what is called a piece of historical fiction. In other words, they took the fact that there was once a grand duchess of Russia named Anastasia, and basically made up everything else around it. Nowhere does this movie indicate that it is supposed to be about Ana Anderson, the woman who claimed to be Anastasia (and was not). Yes, we all know Rasputin was not a rotting corpse, nor was he even still living at the time of the imperial family's abdication and murder. For goodness' sake, it's an animated fairy tale, not a historical documentary! Get over it. We all know Anastasia was murdered along with her family. And as for nit picking about linguistic accuracy, having a degree in foreign language, myself, I find it absolutely hilarious that someone mentioned several inaccuracies in pronunciation but never once mentioned that the name "Anastasia" is actually pronounced "ah-nah-STAH-see-ah." But once again, get over it for goodness' sake! This movie is fantastic if you can sit back and enjoy it for the fairy tale that it is and not get caught up in trying to criticize the fact that it is not real.

    I can't remember exactly the first time I saw the movie. I mean, I've had it on VHS since I could remember. I guess I've just been watching it since then. The movie is quite a masterpiece. The script, the plot, the music. Gosh, I love the music. I swear that I never get tired of watching it. In my opinion, it's my most favorite cartoon musical yet. I also enjoyed the romance. It was perfect. Love at first sight, and a good, happy ending that nobody expects. Even the actors and actresses who voiced the characters were perfect and unique, it's what really made the movie beside the plot and music. I love how classic the graphics are.

    I've watched this movie forever, and it's always been one of my favorites. Over the past year, I became interested in the true story of the Romanov family, and if you're looking for a historically accurate movie, I don't recommend it, but if you want a heartwarming, cuddle-up-in-a-pile-of-blankets movie, this is 100% it. My favorite part is when Anastasia and her grandmother are talking in her room. I always cry, and this is the only movie that will make me cry every time I watch it. This is a magical movie, that I will cherish forever.

    Well, Don Bluth. Looks like you've found a way to make another successful film in your career. It's been a long time since you released such great family hits like "The Secret of NIMH" (avoid the god-awful sequel if you know what's good for you), "An American Tail", "The Land Before Time", and "All Dogs Go To Heaven" and even though your career later went downhill with new films like "Rock-A-Doodle", "Thumbelina", and "The Pebble and the Penguin", I've found them decent and watchable while A Troll in Central Park, although not a terrible movie, was in my opinion not a good film. Then, finally, you made a great comeback by competing with Disney yet again this time with another successful film "Anastasia" based on not only the historical event, but the 1956 movie as well. Before I begin this review, I want to say that I never saw the 1956 movie or read the historical event (I did learn it in class though, but I'm getting ahead of myself), but that doesn't take away the fact that I apparently loved this movie much like anyone else who grew up with it (So did I). I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but let me remind you that this is a children's movie since the violence from that event might be pretty graphic for younger kids. That's why Don Bluth decided to change all of that. Historical inaccuracies aside, I was enthralled by it's average, but magnificent animation and the character animation is decent. Not great, but still good. The characters themselves are well-developed. Anastasia (short-named Anya) is a likable protagonist and I liked her attempts to find out about her past. Dimitri is pretty good too with some great chemistry between him and Anastasia. Other characters including the hilarious comedic talking bat Bartok are likable as well, but the only character that I like the most is Rasputin who was by far a great non-Disney villains and is one of the most darkest ones yet along with some of Disney's villains. Even his dark magic sorcery is great which makes him very original. The story is dark, but not as dark as The Secret of NIMH and although, despite it's historical inaccuracies, it's at least good and the pacing never fails to amuse me, but the strongest aspect goes to the songs/music from David Newman with some great haunting and melodic tunes including "Once Upon a December" "Journey to the Past", "In The Dark of the Night" and more and the voice acting with some great talents like Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Angela Lansbury, Hank Azaria, and Christopher Lloyd since they fitted the characters very well throughout the entire film. Anastasia is this close to becoming a masterpiece of animation. I know lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but as an animation fan, I'm recommending this to others highly as one of Bluth's best works yet. It's also great to see that it made lots of money at the box office. Thumbs up from me!

    I adore Disney's peak era animation films: The Lion King, The Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid. Anastasia, by Fox Studios, sets out to capture that same blockbusting brilliance, and achieves some of it. Anastasia has a strong visual look, headstrong protagonist, entertaining sidekicks and a memorable villain. The film isn't very original, the best stuff feels like a rehash of aforementioned Disney classics. The thing I like best is its realistic feel - the story takes place in 20th century Europe, not some faraway fairy kingdom. There is some magic connected to Rasputin, the bad guy, but it fits in the setting. The songs are alright. The ending has some pretty complex and emotional conflicts, not everything is black and white.

    Anastasia is not a Disney movie. From the first few minutes you'll recognize it's different atmosphere. The palace, the princess herself, everything is slightly different and yet it does not lack the beauty of a classic animated fairytale. You still have your princess, your villain and your talking animals. Dark Rasputin, character that has been used far too many times as the "bad guy" in the movies, Dimitri, who maybe has few faults but who is still pretty much perfect "prince charming" and, of course, the beautiful Anastasia, who with her wildness cannot be mistaken for a Disney princess. Anastasia's and Dimitri's chemistry on the screen is as strong as in any other feature film. The storyline does not have any plot holes or unresolved mysteries and is going so swimmingly that you will not notice the time till it's over. Nevertheless the most important thing in this story, thing this story is really build upon, is the music. Without good music the story would collapse like a house of cards. Fortunately it did not happen and the soundtrack just helps to shape the story into the brilliant masterpiece that it is. The songs are sometimes far from that naive melody you're used to in the Disney movies but it clearly does the movie good. The choices of the voices are excellent and even though I sometimes get annoyed by songs in movies it did not happened to me once in this movie. They will only stay with you if not for the rest of the week then at least for the rest of the day. In conclusion, this movie deserves to be seen and it will brighten your day any time.

    In the Russian revolution of 1817 the Czar of Russia was dethroned, sent into exile and, along with the rest of his family, murdered by Bolsheviks. Rasputin, an evil monk trusted by the family to cure their son, betrayed them and was instrumental in their downfall. But, over the years, rumours surfaced that the Czar's daughter Anastasia had survived the massacre that had claimed her parents, brothers and sisters, and it was hoped that she would one day return to the fold. You know what that story needs? Songs! Ohhhh, a 1, 2, 3, 4, life has been grim since the revolution, la la la de daaaaa! Disney wannabe Don Bluth then jollies things up further by making Rasputin a rotting corpse who spends the film falling to pieces and bantering with a comic relief bat. What's next, a cartoon adaptation of The Final Solution?

    Warning: Spoilers!!! I remember watching this movie as a child on a VHS, but because they are now outdated, I hadn't watched it for years. But it was not long ago I found it on Blu-Ray and bought it unsure whether or not I would find it as good a story as a did almost a decade ago. And I was not disappointed! I say ignore those people who only hate this movie because of its historical inaccuracy, I mean, is it really that important for a movie to be historically correct to be great movie? I hardly think so. I think this story line is in every way amazing! And because this was based on a true story, it encouraged me to research and read up on the real story of Anastasia. This movie is a masterpiece and clearly one of my favorites. The characters are all great in their respected roles and the one thing I particularly loved was that Anastasia, even though she found her family and remembered her past, she gave back the crown so she could be with the one she loved. How many other 'princesses' have done that?? It's a refreshing end! The songs are hauntingly beautiful - so beautiful I went out and bought the album. It's visually great to watch and even though some parts may be a bit scary for the younger audience, I would certainly recommend this as a must-watch! Such an excellent movie! I'd be watching this for many years to come!

    If I didn't know better, I would've assumed Anastasia was a Disney film. It perfectly duplicates the Disney formula, with nearly as much success. Containing all the ingredients of a superb Disney movie, Anastasia can't stack up with the best of animated fairy tales, but it's an enchanting film regardless. Anya has been an orphan from the age of eight. She knows nothing about herself, and is determined to find her family, whom she believes to be in Paris. And it seems she just might make it to Paris when two con men (Dimitri and Vladimir) volunteer to take her there, under the condition she pretends to be the lost princess of Russia, so that they can collect the reward money for finding her. Little do they know what Anya actually IS the lost princess. This is not a particularly original tale. The story has been told time and time again. And while Anastasia may still produce a sense of deja vu, it also manages to make the story feel fresh again. All of the best qualities of a good Disney movie are here, in just slightly inferior fashion. These qualities being: memorable characters, great songs, excellent animation. There are others too, but these are the qualities Anastasia best duplicates. Anastasia is a slightly snarky (but not annoying) damsel, that has much more personality than most other Disney princesses of the time. Dimitri is the scoundrel that (predictably) falls in love with the title character. Vladimir is a jolly and round man, who provides most of the film's humor. The villain, Rasputin, is wonderfully wicked, and has a nasty habit of falling apart at times. A hand here, an eye there, that sort of thing. The voice cast is good, without being quite great. The two standouts are Angela Lansbury as the Russian Empress, and Christopher Lloyd as the villain. The songs are marvelous, though the interesting rhyme schemes take some getting used to. "Journey to the Past" is a magical number, accompanied by great music and spellbinding lyrics. "Once Upon a December," this fairy tale's music box/lullaby song is pleasant, and could've been a spot on parody of any of Disney's songs of the same nature. "Rumor in St. Petersburg" is distinctly Russian, and at the same time, evokes memories of the "Belle" number in Beauty and the Beast (though it's not nearly as good). "In the Dark of the Night" is a fantastic villain's song, with some great accompanying chords and music that really make the song. And "Learn to Do It" is the film's most comedic and easily likable song, with quick clever lyrics (and includes a sweet reprise shortly afterwards). The animation is good, and almost great. There's lots of detail, and pretty good character designs. The main problem is that there's no sense of depth. This leads to some pretty cheap looking segments here and there that could've used some polish. Occasional use of CGI is subtle and not distracting, but enhances the animation. The score, composed by David Newman, has all the elements of a good fairy tale or fantasy score. It's not as playful as most Disney scores (appropriate for the film's slightly darker nature), but it certainly gets the job done. While I wouldn't put it ahead of most Disney Princess movies, Anastasia makes for a worthy rival. Great songs, memorable characters, and a touching story makes Anastasia a winner. I can't say I was expecting much from this Disney look-a-like, but you can call me impressed.

But, over the years, rumours surfaced that the Czar's daughter Anastasia had survived the massacre that had claimed her parents, brothers and sisters, and it was hoped that she would one day return to the fold. You know what that story needs? Songs! Ohhhh, a 1, 2, 3, 4, life has been grim since the revolution, la la la de daaaaa! Disney wannabe Don Bluth then jollies things up further by making Rasputin a rotting corpse who spends the film falling to pieces and bantering with a comic relief bat. What's next, a cartoon adaptation of The Final Solution?

    Warning: Spoilers!!! I remember watching this movie as a child on a VHS, but because they are now outdated, I hadn't watched it for years. But it was not long ago I found it on Blu-Ray and bought it unsure whether or not I would find it as good a story as a did almost a decade ago. And I was not disappointed! I say ignore those people who only hate this movie because of its historical inaccuracy, I mean, is it really that important for a movie to be historically correct to be great movie? I hardly think so. I think this story line is in every way amazing! And because this was based on a true story, it encouraged me to research and read up on the real story of Anastasia. This movie is a masterpiece and clearly one of my favorites. The characters are all great in their respected roles and the one thing I particularly loved was that Anastasia, even though she found her family and remembered her past, she gave back the crown so she could be with the one she loved. How many other 'princesses' have done that?? It's a refreshing end! The songs are hauntingly beautiful - so beautiful I went out and bought the album. It's visually great to watch and even though some parts may be a bit scary for the younger audience, I would certainly recommend this as a must-watch! Such an excellent movie! I'd be watching this for many years to come!

    A Perfect Disney Duplicate

    If I didn't know better, I would've assumed Anastasia was a Disney film. It perfectly duplicates the Disney formula, with nearly as much success. Containing all the ingredients of a superb Disney movie, Anastasia can't stack up with the best of animated fairy tales, but it's an enchanting film regardless. Anya has been an orphan from the age of eight. She knows nothing about herself, and is determined to find her family, whom she believes to be in Paris. And it seems she just might make it to Paris when two con men (Dimitri and Vladimir) volunteer to take her there, under the condition she pretends to be the lost princess of Russia, so that they can collect the reward money for finding her. Little do they know what Anya actually IS the lost princess. This is not a particularly original tale. The story has been told time and time again. And while Anastasia may still produce a sense of deja vu, it also manages to make the story feel fresh again. All of the best qualities of a good Disney movie are here, in just slightly inferior fashion. These qualities being: memorable characters, great songs, excellent animation. There are others too, but these are the qualities Anastasia best duplicates. Anastasia is a slightly snarky (but not annoying) damsel, that has much more personality than most other Disney princesses of the time. Dimitri is the scoundrel that (predictably) falls in love with the title character. Vladimir is a jolly and round man, who provides most of the film's humor. The villain, Rasputin, is wonderfully wicked, and has a nasty habit of falling apart at times. A hand here, an eye there, that sort of thing. The voice cast is good, without being quite great. The two standouts are Angela Lansbury as the Russian Empress, and Christopher Lloyd as the villain. The songs are marvelous, though the interesting rhyme schemes take some getting used to. "Journey to the Past" is a magical number, accompanied by great music and spellbinding lyrics. "Once Upon a December," this fairy tale's music box/lullaby song is pleasant, and could've been a spot on parody of any of Disney's songs of the same nature. "Rumor in St. Petersburg" is distinctly Russian, and at the same time, evokes memories of the "Belle" number in Beauty and the Beast (though it's not nearly as good). "In the Dark of the Night" is a fantastic villain's song, with some great accompanying chords and music that really make the song. And "Learn to Do It" is the film's most comedic and easily likable song, with quick clever lyrics (and includes a sweet reprise shortly afterwards). The animation is good, and almost great. There's lots of detail, and pretty good character designs. The main problem is that there's no sense of depth. This leads to some pretty cheap looking segments here and there that could've used some polish. Occasional use of CGI is subtle and not distracting, but enhances the animation. The score, composed by David Newman, has all the elements of a good fairy tale or fantasy score. It's not as playful as most Disney scores (appropriate for the film's slightly darker nature), but it certainly gets the job done. While I wouldn't put it ahead of most Disney Princess movies, Anastasia makes for a worthy rival. Great songs, memorable characters, and a touching story makes Anastasia a winner. I can't say I was expecting much from this Disney look-a-like, but you can call me impressed.

    I love this movie! The score is amazing! I have to laugh at all of the people giving bad reviews over historical accuracy. Let me explain something that may help you get beyond this. This is what is called a piece of historical fiction. In other words, they took the fact that there was once a grand duchess of Russia named Anastasia, and basically made up everything else around it. Nowhere does this movie indicate that it is supposed to be about Ana Anderson, the woman who claimed to be Anastasia (and was not). Yes, we all know Rasputin was not a rotting corpse, nor was he even still living at the time of the imperial family's abdication and murder. For goodness' sake, it's an animated fairy tale, not a historical documentary! Get over it. We all know Anastasia was murdered along with her family. And as for nit picking about linguistic accuracy, having a degree in foreign language, myself, I find it absolutely hilarious that someone mentioned several inaccuracies in pronunciation but never once mentioned that the name "Anastasia" is actually pronounced "ah-nah-STAH-see-ah." But once again, get over it for goodness' sake! This movie is fantastic if you can sit back and enjoy it for the fairy tale that it is and not get caught up in trying to criticize the fact that it is not real.

    I can't remember exactly the first time I saw the movie. I mean, I've had it on VHS since I could remember. I guess I've just been watching it since then. The movie is quite a masterpiece. The script, the plot, the music. Gosh, I love the music. I swear that I never get tired of watching it. In my opinion, it's my most favorite cartoon musical yet. I also enjoyed the romance. It was perfect. Love at first sight, and a good, happy ending that nobody expects. Even the actors and actresses who voiced the characters were perfect and unique, it's what really made the movie beside the plot and music. I love how classic the graphics are.

    I've watched this movie forever, and it's always been one of my favorites. Over the past year, I became interested in the true story of the Romanov family, and if you're looking for a historically accurate movie, I don't recommend it, but if you want a heartwarming, cuddle-up-in-a-pile-of-blankets movie, this is 100% it. My favorite part is when Anastasia and her grandmother are talking in her room. I always cry, and this is the only movie that will make me cry every time I watch it. This is a magical movie, that I will cherish forever.

    Don Bluth's excellent comeback and it's been almost 15 years since it's release!

    Well, Don Bluth. Looks like you've found a way to make another successful film in your career. It's been a long time since you released such great family hits like "The Secret of NIMH" (avoid the god-awful sequel if you know what's good for you), "An American Tail", "The Land Before Time", and "All Dogs Go To Heaven" and even though your career later went downhill with new films like "Rock-A-Doodle", "Thumbelina", and "The Pebble and the Penguin", I've found them decent and watchable while A Troll in Central Park, although not a terrible movie, was in my opinion not a good film. Then, finally, you made a great comeback by competing with Disney yet again this time with another successful film "Anastasia" based on not only the historical event, but the 1956 movie as well. Before I begin this review, I want to say that I never saw the 1956 movie or read the historical event (I did learn it in class though, but I'm getting ahead of myself), but that doesn't take away the fact that I apparently loved this movie much like anyone else who grew up with it (So did I). I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but let me remind you that this is a children's movie since the violence from that event might be pretty graphic for younger kids. That's why Don Bluth decided to change all of that. Historical inaccuracies aside, I was enthralled by it's average, but magnificent animation and the character animation is decent. Not great, but still good. The characters themselves are well-developed. Anastasia (short-named Anya) is a likable protagonist and I liked her attempts to find out about her past. Dimitri is pretty good too with some great chemistry between him and Anastasia. Other characters including the hilarious comedic talking bat Bartok are likable as well, but the only character that I like the most is Rasputin who was by far a great non-Disney villains and is one of the most darkest ones yet along with some of Disney's villains. Even his dark magic sorcery is great which makes him very original. The story is dark, but not as dark as The Secret of NIMH and although, despite it's historical inaccuracies, it's at least good and the pacing never fails to amuse me, but the strongest aspect goes to the songs/music from David Newman with some great haunting and melodic tunes including "Once Upon a December" "Journey to the Past", "In The Dark of the Night" and more and the voice acting with some great talents like Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Angela Lansbury, Hank Azaria, and Christopher Lloyd since they fitted the characters very well throughout the entire film. Anastasia is this close to becoming a masterpiece of animation. I know lots of people hated this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but as an animation fan, I'm recommending this to others highly as one of Bluth's best works yet. It's also great to see that it made lots of money at the box office. Thumbs up from me!

    you know that movie from your childhood you can recite word for word? this is my movie like that. the live action version is very similar from the 50's. i love history and this movie has made that stronger. i even have the music box. i would love a replica of her necklace. this movie has so many of my favorite actors in it and my driving force to visit the palace one day. i love this movie so much it always gives me a dreamy feel. the songs are amazing. i just wish it had been more popular. gorgeous animation in it. a mix of cg and story board with such detail. even the prince for the princess is amazing. a con artist willing to give up money for his love. i used to dream of a guy like him now didn't happen.
