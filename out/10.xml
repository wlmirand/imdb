 <sinopse>

 <storyline>
  William Shakespeare's classic play is brought into the present with the setting as Great Britian in the 1930s. Civil war has erupted with the House of Lancaster on one side, claiming the right to the British throne and hoping to bring freedom to the country. Opposing is the House of York, commanded by the infamous Richard who rules over a fascist government and hopes to install himself as a dictator monarch.

    ....understand the left (marxist-leninists and lovers of Obama) always love films that depict the 'evil' with a khaki uniform and the hardware in tow - i.e. 'Hitler' as an convenient is such a 'lock' to embrace the college kids. What secured my affection was the remark (mind you truly Shakespeare) when Annette Benning replied to 'Richard's' (Ian McKellen) inquiry as to what she thought of him i.e. "What thinkest of me madame?" Her laser reply "Thou art a bottled spider!" We have today in 2013 some 18 years hence the reality of a world continuing into the 'abyss' and mind you, not a moment of pause as the patricians ignore the free fall - (abortion, gay gay all over, SEIU, the usual entitlement idiocy) this is all Richard III is about. No - not the clutter and self induced suicide of the antagonist but the wrecking of decorum to slate the thirst of licentiousness and most of all what Hillary longs for 'power'. This is what the left loathes the most - use of satire to magnify the con - remember that great (for you west coast viewers i.e. 'blank' naw yawk) Jack In The Box TV ad some 12 years ago? The condescending monarch commenting on the sandwiches presented to him? "Peanut butter!" and the scullion daring to say "Where's the butter?" with the reply "SILENCE!" Obama is that king and get ready for more from the house hand 'barakska' with the 'Kung Fu Master with the GI Joe grip!" Only sorry one doesn't use that dwarf pock marked pig Joey Stalin or better yet that gonorrhea riddled 'attorney (now there's a career worth pursuing) Lenin.

    Granted, this Richard III is not for everybody due to the updated setting. However, I am not one of those who says that any adaptation that doesn't stick to the original setting and such is immediately rubbish. I do find that approach unfair, and have always thought considering that we are talking about different mediums here that adaptations should be judged on their own terms. Because on its own terms, this Richard III is excellent, not as good as Olivier's film but then again it is always a tough act to come up with something equal to film as amazing as Olivier's. The only things that I didn't like so much were that Edward's speech being cut meant that John Wood had literally nothing to do and Rivers' death scene for me didn't make sense. Also, Robert Downey Jnr's role is small and important, but at the same time I did find him too American and this jarred. However, the updated setting I had no problem with. As well as the fact that it's clear what the period is, the sets and costumes are beautiful and evocative, and Richard's entrance in a tank through the wall is incredibly dynamic even for a film adaptation of Shakespeare. Trevor Jones' music fits perfectly with the mood, haunting, poignant and tense all in one. The song set to Christopher Marlowe's words at the ball surprisingly likewise. The dialogue is as ever brilliant, of course there are cuts which is necessary considering the running time, but the dry yet inspired delivery of "well I'm not made of stone" really stands out. It was very effective at how Richard looked into the camera as if talking directly to the audience, this did help us to engage with the characters and the story. The story is daringly told and compelling, with a powerful and hilarious if not quite epic final scene and the touching morgue scene. Richard has always been a controversial yet enigmatic character, and Ian McKellen plays him superbly. He gives the character humour and charm yet also treachery and menace, and does so in a mesmerising way. Kristin Scott Thomas is a moving Anne, and Annette Bening is a fully-realised and sympathetic Elizabeth. Maggie Smith commands her scenes in whatever scene she appears in, and Jim Broadbent's Buckingham is wonderfully sly. Adrian Dunbar is effectively eerie and ruthless as is Tim McInnery, and Nigel Hawthorne affects as Clarence. Donald Sumpter's Blackenbury is nice to spot. All in all, an excellent Richard III if not for all tastes. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox

    An anachronistic performance of Shakespeare's play, using most, if not all, of the lines from the original. As I understand it, some characters have been combined, but that's the nature of adaptations. It's basically the same play, in other words, only the settings and the costumes are from the 1930s/40s. I think that helps make the play less distant, though I don't have any firm evidence to back that up. Also, there are some fantastic performances here. Ian McKellen is wonderfully villainous as Richard. And if you want to see Robert Downey, Jr. stabbed in the back while "in the throes of passion", if you know what I mean, this is the movie for you. One last thing: I've both read and seen performances of multiple Shakespeare plays, and I would definitely recommend watching a performance, if you can, because this performance made it much easier to see all the Tudor propaganda that Shakespeare stuffed into the play (Richard is a hunchbacked, crippled sociopath who murders his way to the top and tries to marry his niece, while the Duke of Richmond, the future Henry VII, is a really nice guy whose heirs will, according to Shakespeare, bring peace to England; also, Richard is associated with lots of Hitler-esque paraphernalia). I enjoyed it very much.

    Now I have heard it said that the beauty about Shakespeare is that you can take it out of the setting in which the original play was written in, place it in a new setting, and it will still be a brilliant play. Now this is something that I do not necessarily agree with, namely because while up until the 20th Century this could be the case, the world has changed and a lot of the dialogue simply does not fit. Now the events of this film are set in the 15th Century, however the film itself is set in the 1930's. This in itself worked well (and as I argue, made for a very original film) but it falls apart at the end when Richard, after his jeep is bogged, cries out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse'. This, personally, does not really make any sense on the modern battlefield (not that horses aren't used, back in 2004 or 2005, I can't quite remember when, the capital of Kyrgistan was stormed by men on horseback), however I really do not want this minor problem destroy a good film. What this film is doing, is taking the story of Richard III out of the historical content and simply turning into a play about a tyrant. Now, it is debatable as to whether Richard III was actually a tyrant. He was the last of the Plantagenet dynasty, and was deposed at the battle of Bosworth field, after Henry Tudor defeated him and claimed the English throne for himself. This was considered to be the end of England's medieval period and brought not only stability to the country, but also ushered her into the Modern Era. Beforehand, England has just come out of a 100 year war with France (on the losing side) and this sent the country into civil war (the War of the Roses) in which the houses of Lancaster and York fought over the English Throne. The beginning of the play has Edward assume the throne after his predecessor, Henry VI is defeated in battle, however Edward is not on the throne for long and after he dies his son, Edward, takes the throne with Richard as Lord Protector. However, the barons vote to give the throne to Richard, and the crown prince and his brother then disappear. What is not clear is whether Richard was actually responsible for Edward's death and his children's disappearance, and whether his took the throne through manipulation and stealth (something which had been happening since the close of the 100 years war). What Shakespeare does though is turn Richard into a villain. It appears that Richard's deformity was a creation of Shakespeare, and the rumour that the princes were murdered in the Tower of London is also said to be of his creation. In fact, it is suggested that the princes simply vanished from public life after Richard was crowned. One might raise the point that the princes were imprisoned in the Tower of London. While these days the Tower of London is seen as a prison, back then this wasn't the case. The Tower, along with numerous other castles, were originally built by William the Conquerer to protect his newly conquered realm, and later reinforced by Edward III. The Tower of London in Richard's time was simply another castle, and it was only after this incidence that it inherited its reputation. It should also be remembered that in those days royalty, when imprisoned, were held in the castles, but not in the dungeons as we imagine. Castles were luxurious (and the Tower of London was no exception) and while one may have been imprisoned, imprisonment meant that one simply could not leave the castle. Another thing that stood out with this movie was how Richard came to the throne. We have the nobles and barons all pressuring him to take the throne, and in the end he relents. However, this film (and I suspect Shakespeare as well) manipulate this to make it appear that it was all a part of the plan between Buckingham and Richard. However, once Richard is on the throne, he becomes even more wretched and corrupt, in then end killing children and rejecting his friends, until he is left alone on Bodsworth Field. It is funny that when he does cry out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse', he really did not have a kingdom left to give. He had already lost. As for the horse, well if you led an army and you lost your horse, then you were in trouble. It is a shame that this film is very difficult to come by because I really do like this movie. I found it original, and the setting in the 1930's with Richard taking on a fascist mantle upon assuming the throne worked very well. While fascism did not exist in the 15th Century, and while Richard was strictly not a fascist, he was a tyrant (and least as the play portrays him) and to put him in the uniform of a fascist simply adds to the impression of tyranny that the play creates.

    King Richard III didn't live in the 1930's, and William Shakespeare didn't write in the 20th century. This historical figure lived in the the late Middle Ages, and Shakespeare wrote in the very late 16th and early 17th centuries near the end of the Renaissance. To snatch an historical figure 600 years out of his historical context and a corresponding play 450 years out of its theatrical and artistic context I believe loses the entire point of Shakespeare's original play. Taking bona fide masterpieces of theater and setting them down into another period is certainly in vogue these days, and victims have included other masterworks, including those by Wolfgang Mozart/da Ponte and even Richard Wagner. It is a practice I question, if only to say they simply are not the original works as intended by the artist-creators. They may be compelling and interesting but exist as a new work with elements of the original but they are NOT equivalent to the original. In this case, Richard III is set in the early 20th century during the period when the Nazis ruled Germany. Now, certainly any artist is free to do whatever he or she wishes with a play or opera which is in the public domain. But just because these things can be done, the question is whether they should be done, or at least to acknowledge they are fundamentally altering the original. Unfortunately however, this practice of "contextual re-appropriation" for lack of a better term is often rationalized in such a way to make it more real for contemporary audiences. Again, that's fine, but it is a morphing of the original work into something else. Making Richard III into a European Nazi-sympathizer of the 1930's is reshaping Shakespeare's original vision into something quite distinctive from a 16th-century interpretation of a 15th-century historical figure. The bottom line: no matter what it is, and not matter how well it works on its own terms, it is not really Shakespeare anymore. Now granted, I am not saying it should never be done, but it is not Richard III as conceived by William Shakespeare. Consider the following: Could Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire be transferred to early Colonial America? Or how about Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" set in Elizabethan England, with Oscar as a tavern owner and Felix as a cobbler? Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" could be easily set in a host of other eras, such as the Middle Ages or even Antiquity. Or maybe a film version of Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer", keeping all the dialog, but set in the ghetto of New York in the 1970's. Again these "morphings" could possibly work on their own terms, but they wouldn't be Williams, Simon, Gilbert-Sullivan, or Twain anymore. They would be something else, and I think something would certainly be lost by placing them outside their contexts. Part of what makes them rich and appealing has to do with their original eras. Funny, though, no one would dare do this to Williams or Twain, but Shakespeare, Mozart and Wagner are constantly being re-contextualized. Maybe for myself after watching this film is that I never saw King Richard III of England. I saw a new character possibly inspired by Richard III but not Shakespeare's Richard III. Richard III lived in the late Middle Ages. He didn't have access to machine guns, tanks or telephones. He wouldn't have understood the terms fascism or communism. And he certainly would not have been smoking a cigarette. And to add one further point, there are a myriad of films set during World War II. Is it really necessary to take a Shakespeare play and put it there as well? As it is, there are not as many big-budget productions of Shakespeare plays produced after 1970 set in their original context as their should be, barring the wonderful BBC productions. There are plenty of films depicting Europe before, during and just after the Nazis. Because I prefer my Shakespeare, my Mozart and my Wagner produced in ways more closely adapted into what the authors had intended, which includes their historical context, I am not a good judge of this kind of material. Richard III to its credit may work on its own terms. But the use of the original Shakespearean language for a setting in the 20th century doesn't make much sense to me, and I don't really see the point. West Side Story, which was Romeo and Juliet set in 1950's New York, is a perfect example of how Shakespeare can be updated without messing with the original. Instead of the actors saying lines in Elizabethan English, new dialog was written which was contextually more appropriate for the mid-20th century, particular white gang members and Puerto Ricans in New York City. I think I would have preferred a newly written work with the plot inspired by Richard III rather than thrusting Shakespeare's blank verse across several centuries and putting it where it really doesn't belong.

    The 1995 film is a masterpiece. I'm not familiar with Richard Loncraine, the director, but the cast includes such luminaries as Ian McKellan, Annette Bening, Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas, and Maggie Smith. McKellan adapted the play to a modern England where it has become a fascist state. King Richard is a kind of Hitler, and the wars are fought with modern equipment. We are sucked into McKellan's version so completely that the anachronisms between the language and the time don't matter. McKellan is excellent as the mad would-be dictator, and the rest of the cast is lifted to his level. As with all Shakespeare's work, I recommend reading the work before seeing the movie. I'd suggest a copy of the Folger's or Arden editions (either or both probably available from your local library for free) with explanations of the more obscure words and phrases. The language of Shakespeare is beautiful, and the cast here is equal to the words. McKellan is a superbly evil and maniacal Richard as he murders his way to the throne, and his death is one of the best on film. He nails the role; he nails the look as a sordid, dissolute tyrant. This adaptation is similar to July Taymore's adaptation of "Titus Andronicus" to modern times in her 1999 film "Titus." Taymore and McKellan have both done excellent jobs of introducing modern elements into classical tragedies from Shakespeare. They showcase the incredible genius behind the works, still relevant today. A reminder that this film is an adaptation and that McKellan rearranged scenes, removed characters, and rewrote dialogue. I have not seen Olivier's "Richard III," but it gets high marks as the best on film for the true play, not an adaptation.

    First the good: the movement to modern neo-fascism was interesting, the twist on many of the speeches was fascinating (which is one of the pleasures of re-doing Shakespeare - viz. the interpretation), McKellen is great, and most of the supporting cast is solid. What I didn't like as much: some of the choices regarding what dialogue to keep and what to discard. Losing some of the opening soliloquy was unnecessary and a crime to Richard III fans. Benning and Downey Jr are not good in this - I like them in other films but here they sounded as if they were reciting lines that they had carefully memorized - very unnatural. But mostly where I think this falls short of the Olivier version is in the believability of Richard as a charmer. Olivier makes you believe that Richard could fool people. In this version, Richard is so blatantly evil that nobody could be deceived by him. Maybe they aren't supposed to be in this version but Richard III is one of the all-time great villains because he could charm people (a la Hannibal Lecter). Not here.

    This is a filmed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Film has different constraints than stage, not the least of which is time. A three or four hour theatrical performance can be divided with an intermission for audience comfort and concentration. A stage production can get away with hinting while a film has to re-create verisimilitude. A stage production strongly suggests 'as if' --hence actors taking a bow after the performance--while a film must mean: this is it, the film actors wanting to convey a death actually occurred. So in film lots gets lost in translation. But in this adaptation of Richard III in a fascist state, the sense of Richard giving himself over to total evil is not lost. Richard III is not Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth, or Brutus. These others are brought low by their humanity, by their human aspirations. From the get-go Richard plans on murder to become ruler, he announces to the audience that he will murder to get what he wants, and he stops at nothing to murder people who are in his way. The film doesn't miss this part of Richard. And for me, the final scene of Richard falling into what looks like the fires of eternal damnation made the movie worth the price of admission. The model of Richard III in fascist 20 century is not the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, not even Vidun Quisling who betrayed Norway to the Nazis. The model of Richard III is Adolf Hitler. The fact that Richard III has a sinister mustache to match Hitler's sinister mustache could not have been lost on the principals of the film. Richard III was a real historical character; Shakespeare derived his characterization from Sir Thomas More's "The History of King Richard the Third." Thomas More--the Man for All Seasons. Thomas More painted the blackest portrait of Richard III, a portrait only now being questioned, but in Shakespeare's day, Richard III was Villain personified. Hitler, like Richard III, was no fiction. Hitler's totalitarian state realized the death of millions of Jews, the death of millions of Russians, the death of European society. The German state had been turned over to the forces of evil as state policy. So Richard III,--Hitler--falling into the fires of eternal damnation seemed a fitting conclusion to those fascistic machinations. Many commentators of this film, film being democratic while theatre is elitist, seemed at a loss as to where to go for Shakespeare. SIGNET CLASSICS provides an excellent paperback resource with the play reproduced in Shakesearian English with footnotes to interpret the more obscure words Shakespeare might have used; plus every play has several interpretive essays to help guide the reader in thinking about the play. FOLGER Shakespeare LIBRARY from Washington, DC provides a similar service of paperback editions with each scene interpreted in modern English, difficult vocabulary defined, prints dating from the age of Shakespeare. PBS has filmed each and every Shakespearian play in its entirety; but again PBS provides a film of a stage performance and there are still niceties of film that stage can't reproduce; for example, the camera focusing on one person's face despite others being on stage. We live in a day and age which seems to have no moral constraints upon it; as Cole Porter might say: anything goes. Richard III--this filmed adaptation with that final scene of Richard falling into what could be construed by the audience as the fires of eternal damnation--reminds the audience that there is accountability and punishment for behavior. And Richard as a doppelganger for Hitler brings that message home.

    This dynamic adaptation of the Shakespeare play is reset in a kingdom that looks suspiciously like 1930s Germany and depicts Richard III as a ruthless fascist. The film looks marvelous, and it's got a great cast. Ian McKellen of course deserves the most praise for his performance as Richard, which he throws himself into with plummy gusto. But strong performances are to be given by all, including Annette Bening, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas and Maggie Smith. What I like most about the film is that it's very cinematic; it takes a stage property and actually ADAPTS it to the screen, rather than making a filmed version of a stage play. The "my kingdom for a horse" line gets quite a laugh in the context it's given here. Grade: A-

    In this version of Richard III the action has been moved to England in the 1930's. The move to this time period is flawless. While not as good as Titus (which is similar) this is a great film with fine performances. Maggie Smith as the Duchess of York steals this movie with her expert handling of Shakespeare. The scene she has with Ian McKellan (Richard III)by the stairs is amazing. Maggie Smith should have been a candidate for an Oscar for Best Supporting actress, a truly flawless performance. Annette Bening is very moving as Queen ELizabeth. Her best scene is in front of the building where her sons are being held prisoner by Richard. Krisitn Scott-THomas is riveting as Lady Anne. Ian McKellan is astounding as RIchard III. This is probably his best performance (even better than his performance as James Whale in "Gods and Monsters.") THe costumes and sets are also expertly done. Richard III is a near masterpiece.

As I understand it, some characters have been combined, but that's the nature of adaptations. It's basically the same play, in other words, only the settings and the costumes are from the 1930s/40s. I think that helps make the play less distant, though I don't have any firm evidence to back that up. Also, there are some fantastic performances here. Ian McKellen is wonderfully villainous as Richard. And if you want to see Robert Downey, Jr. stabbed in the back while "in the throes of passion", if you know what I mean, this is the movie for you. One last thing: I've both read and seen performances of multiple Shakespeare plays, and I would definitely recommend watching a performance, if you can, because this performance made it much easier to see all the Tudor propaganda that Shakespeare stuffed into the play (Richard is a hunchbacked, crippled sociopath who murders his way to the top and tries to marry his niece, while the Duke of Richmond, the future Henry VII, is a really nice guy whose heirs will, according to Shakespeare, bring peace to England; also, Richard is associated with lots of Hitler-esque paraphernalia). I enjoyed it very much.

    Now I have heard it said that the beauty about Shakespeare is that you can take it out of the setting in which the original play was written in, place it in a new setting, and it will still be a brilliant play. Now this is something that I do not necessarily agree with, namely because while up until the 20th Century this could be the case, the world has changed and a lot of the dialogue simply does not fit. Now the events of this film are set in the 15th Century, however the film itself is set in the 1930's. This in itself worked well (and as I argue, made for a very original film) but it falls apart at the end when Richard, after his jeep is bogged, cries out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse'. This, personally, does not really make any sense on the modern battlefield (not that horses aren't used, back in 2004 or 2005, I can't quite remember when, the capital of Kyrgistan was stormed by men on horseback), however I really do not want this minor problem destroy a good film. What this film is doing, is taking the story of Richard III out of the historical content and simply turning into a play about a tyrant. Now, it is debatable as to whether Richard III was actually a tyrant. He was the last of the Plantagenet dynasty, and was deposed at the battle of Bosworth field, after Henry Tudor defeated him and claimed the English throne for himself. This was considered to be the end of England's medieval period and brought not only stability to the country, but also ushered her into the Modern Era. Beforehand, England has just come out of a 100 year war with France (on the losing side) and this sent the country into civil war (the War of the Roses) in which the houses of Lancaster and York fought over the English Throne. The beginning of the play has Edward assume the throne after his predecessor, Henry VI is defeated in battle, however Edward is not on the throne for long and after he dies his son, Edward, takes the throne with Richard as Lord Protector. However, the barons vote to give the throne to Richard, and the crown prince and his brother then disappear. What is not clear is whether Richard was actually responsible for Edward's death and his children's disappearance, and whether his took the throne through manipulation and stealth (something which had been happening since the close of the 100 years war). What Shakespeare does though is turn Richard into a villain. It appears that Richard's deformity was a creation of Shakespeare, and the rumour that the princes were murdered in the Tower of London is also said to be of his creation. In fact, it is suggested that the princes simply vanished from public life after Richard was crowned. One might raise the point that the princes were imprisoned in the Tower of London. While these days the Tower of London is seen as a prison, back then this wasn't the case. The Tower, along with numerous other castles, were originally built by William the Conquerer to protect his newly conquered realm, and later reinforced by Edward III. The Tower of London in Richard's time was simply another castle, and it was only after this incidence that it inherited its reputation. It should also be remembered that in those days royalty, when imprisoned, were held in the castles, but not in the dungeons as we imagine. Castles were luxurious (and the Tower of London was no exception) and while one may have been imprisoned, imprisonment meant that one simply could not leave the castle. Another thing that stood out with this movie was how Richard came to the throne. We have the nobles and barons all pressuring him to take the throne, and in the end he relents. However, this film (and I suspect Shakespeare as well) manipulate this to make it appear that it was all a part of the plan between Buckingham and Richard. However, once Richard is on the throne, he becomes even more wretched and corrupt, in then end killing children and rejecting his friends, until he is left alone on Bodsworth Field. It is funny that when he does cry out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse', he really did not have a kingdom left to give. He had already lost. As for the horse, well if you led an army and you lost your horse, then you were in trouble. It is a shame that this film is very difficult to come by because I really do like this movie. I found it original, and the setting in the 1930's with Richard taking on a fascist mantle upon assuming the throne worked very well. While fascism did not exist in the 15th Century, and while Richard was strictly not a fascist, he was a tyrant (and least as the play portrays him) and to put him in the uniform of a fascist simply adds to the impression of tyranny that the play creates.

    King Richard III didn't live in the 1930's, and William Shakespeare didn't write in the 20th century. This historical figure lived in the the late Middle Ages, and Shakespeare wrote in the very late 16th and early 17th centuries near the end of the Renaissance. To snatch an historical figure 600 years out of his historical context and a corresponding play 450 years out of its theatrical and artistic context I believe loses the entire point of Shakespeare's original play. Taking bona fide masterpieces of theater and setting them down into another period is certainly in vogue these days, and victims have included other masterworks, including those by Wolfgang Mozart/da Ponte and even Richard Wagner. It is a practice I question, if only to say they simply are not the original works as intended by the artist-creators. They may be compelling and interesting but exist as a new work with elements of the original but they are NOT equivalent to the original. In this case, Richard III is set in the early 20th century during the period when the Nazis ruled Germany. Now, certainly any artist is free to do whatever he or she wishes with a play or opera which is in the public domain. But just because these things can be done, the question is whether they should be done, or at least to acknowledge they are fundamentally altering the original. Unfortunately however, this practice of "contextual re-appropriation" for lack of a better term is often rationalized in such a way to make it more real for contemporary audiences. Again, that's fine, but it is a morphing of the original work into something else. Making Richard III into a European Nazi-sympathizer of the 1930's is reshaping Shakespeare's original vision into something quite distinctive from a 16th-century interpretation of a 15th-century historical figure. The bottom line: no matter what it is, and not matter how well it works on its own terms, it is not really Shakespeare anymore. Now granted, I am not saying it should never be done, but it is not Richard III as conceived by William Shakespeare. Consider the following: Could Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire be transferred to early Colonial America? Or how about Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" set in Elizabethan England, with Oscar as a tavern owner and Felix as a cobbler? Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" could be easily set in a host of other eras, such as the Middle Ages or even Antiquity. Or maybe a film version of Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer", keeping all the dialog, but set in the ghetto of New York in the 1970's. Again these "morphings" could possibly work on their own terms, but they wouldn't be Williams, Simon, Gilbert-Sullivan, or Twain anymore. They would be something else, and I think something would certainly be lost by placing them outside their contexts. Part of what makes them rich and appealing has to do with their original eras. Funny, though, no one would dare do this to Williams or Twain, but Shakespeare, Mozart and Wagner are constantly being re-contextualized. Maybe for myself after watching this film is that I never saw King Richard III of England. I saw a new character possibly inspired by Richard III but not Shakespeare's Richard III. Richard III lived in the late Middle Ages. He didn't have access to machine guns, tanks or telephones. He wouldn't have understood the terms fascism or communism. And he certainly would not have been smoking a cigarette. And to add one further point, there are a myriad of films set during World War II. Is it really necessary to take a Shakespeare play and put it there as well? As it is, there are not as many big-budget productions of Shakespeare plays produced after 1970 set in their original context as their should be, barring the wonderful BBC productions. There are plenty of films depicting Europe before, during and just after the Nazis. Because I prefer my Shakespeare, my Mozart and my Wagner produced in ways more closely adapted into what the authors had intended, which includes their historical context, I am not a good judge of this kind of material. Richard III to its credit may work on its own terms. But the use of the original Shakespearean language for a setting in the 20th century doesn't make much sense to me, and I don't really see the point. West Side Story, which was Romeo and Juliet set in 1950's New York, is a perfect example of how Shakespeare can be updated without messing with the original. Instead of the actors saying lines in Elizabethan English, new dialog was written which was contextually more appropriate for the mid-20th century, particular white gang members and Puerto Ricans in New York City. I think I would have preferred a newly written work with the plot inspired by Richard III rather than thrusting Shakespeare's blank verse across several centuries and putting it where it really doesn't belong.

    The 1995 film is a masterpiece. I'm not familiar with Richard Loncraine, the director, but the cast includes such luminaries as Ian McKellan, Annette Bening, Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas, and Maggie Smith. McKellan adapted the play to a modern England where it has become a fascist state. King Richard is a kind of Hitler, and the wars are fought with modern equipment. We are sucked into McKellan's version so completely that the anachronisms between the language and the time don't matter. McKellan is excellent as the mad would-be dictator, and the rest of the cast is lifted to his level. As with all Shakespeare's work, I recommend reading the work before seeing the movie. I'd suggest a copy of the Folger's or Arden editions (either or both probably available from your local library for free) with explanations of the more obscure words and phrases. The language of Shakespeare is beautiful, and the cast here is equal to the words. McKellan is a superbly evil and maniacal Richard as he murders his way to the throne, and his death is one of the best on film. He nails the role; he nails the look as a sordid, dissolute tyrant. This adaptation is similar to July Taymore's adaptation of "Titus Andronicus" to modern times in her 1999 film "Titus." Taymore and McKellan have both done excellent jobs of introducing modern elements into classical tragedies from Shakespeare. They showcase the incredible genius behind the works, still relevant today. A reminder that this film is an adaptation and that McKellan rearranged scenes, removed characters, and rewrote dialogue. I have not seen Olivier's "Richard III," but it gets high marks as the best on film for the true play, not an adaptation.

    First the good: the movement to modern neo-fascism was interesting, the twist on many of the speeches was fascinating (which is one of the pleasures of re-doing Shakespeare - viz. the interpretation), McKellen is great, and most of the supporting cast is solid. What I didn't like as much: some of the choices regarding what dialogue to keep and what to discard. Losing some of the opening soliloquy was unnecessary and a crime to Richard III fans. Benning and Downey Jr are not good in this - I like them in other films but here they sounded as if they were reciting lines that they had carefully memorized - very unnatural. But mostly where I think this falls short of the Olivier version is in the believability of Richard as a charmer. Olivier makes you believe that Richard could fool people. In this version, Richard is so blatantly evil that nobody could be deceived by him. Maybe they aren't supposed to be in this version but Richard III is one of the all-time great villains because he could charm people (a la Hannibal Lecter). Not here.

    RICHARD III: A filmed adaptation

    This is a filmed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Film has different constraints than stage, not the least of which is time. A three or four hour theatrical performance can be divided with an intermission for audience comfort and concentration. A stage production can get away with hinting while a film has to re-create verisimilitude. A stage production strongly suggests 'as if' --hence actors taking a bow after the performance--while a film must mean: this is it, the film actors wanting to convey a death actually occurred. So in film lots gets lost in translation. But in this adaptation of Richard III in a fascist state, the sense of Richard giving himself over to total evil is not lost. Richard III is not Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth, or Brutus. These others are brought low by their humanity, by their human aspirations. From the get-go Richard plans on murder to become ruler, he announces to the audience that he will murder to get what he wants, and he stops at nothing to murder people who are in his way. The film doesn't miss this part of Richard. And for me, the final scene of Richard falling into what looks like the fires of eternal damnation made the movie worth the price of admission. The model of Richard III in fascist 20 century is not the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, not even Vidun Quisling who betrayed Norway to the Nazis. The model of Richard III is Adolf Hitler. The fact that Richard III has a sinister mustache to match Hitler's sinister mustache could not have been lost on the principals of the film. Richard III was a real historical character; Shakespeare derived his characterization from Sir Thomas More's "The History of King Richard the Third." Thomas More--the Man for All Seasons. Thomas More painted the blackest portrait of Richard III, a portrait only now being questioned, but in Shakespeare's day, Richard III was Villain personified. Hitler, like Richard III, was no fiction. Hitler's totalitarian state realized the death of millions of Jews, the death of millions of Russians, the death of European society. The German state had been turned over to the forces of evil as state policy. So Richard III,--Hitler--falling into the fires of eternal damnation seemed a fitting conclusion to those fascistic machinations. Many commentators of this film, film being democratic while theatre is elitist, seemed at a loss as to where to go for Shakespeare. SIGNET CLASSICS provides an excellent paperback resource with the play reproduced in Shakesearian English with footnotes to interpret the more obscure words Shakespeare might have used; plus every play has several interpretive essays to help guide the reader in thinking about the play. FOLGER Shakespeare LIBRARY from Washington, DC provides a similar service of paperback editions with each scene interpreted in modern English, difficult vocabulary defined, prints dating from the age of Shakespeare. PBS has filmed each and every Shakespearian play in its entirety; but again PBS provides a film of a stage performance and there are still niceties of film that stage can't reproduce; for example, the camera focusing on one person's face despite others being on stage. We live in a day and age which seems to have no moral constraints upon it; as Cole Porter might say: anything goes. Richard III--this filmed adaptation with that final scene of Richard falling into what could be construed by the audience as the fires of eternal damnation--reminds the audience that there is accountability and punishment for behavior. And Richard as a doppelganger for Hitler brings that message home.

    This dynamic adaptation of the Shakespeare play is reset in a kingdom that looks suspiciously like 1930s Germany and depicts Richard III as a ruthless fascist. The film looks marvelous, and it's got a great cast. Ian McKellen of course deserves the most praise for his performance as Richard, which he throws himself into with plummy gusto. But strong performances are to be given by all, including Annette Bening, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas and Maggie Smith. What I like most about the film is that it's very cinematic; it takes a stage property and actually ADAPTS it to the screen, rather than making a filmed version of a stage play. The "my kingdom for a horse" line gets quite a laugh in the context it's given here. Grade: A-

    In this version of Richard III the action has been moved to England in the 1930's. The move to this time period is flawless. While not as good as Titus (which is similar) this is a great film with fine performances. Maggie Smith as the Duchess of York steals this movie with her expert handling of Shakespeare. The scene she has with Ian McKellan (Richard III)by the stairs is amazing. Maggie Smith should have been a candidate for an Oscar for Best Supporting actress, a truly flawless performance. Annette Bening is very moving as Queen ELizabeth. Her best scene is in front of the building where her sons are being held prisoner by Richard. Krisitn Scott-THomas is riveting as Lady Anne. Ian McKellan is astounding as RIchard III. This is probably his best performance (even better than his performance as James Whale in "Gods and Monsters.") THe costumes and sets are also expertly done. Richard III is a near masterpiece.

    ....understand the left (marxist-leninists and lovers of Obama) always love films that depict the 'evil' with a khaki uniform and the hardware in tow - i.e. 'Hitler' as an convenient is such a 'lock' to embrace the college kids. What secured my affection was the remark (mind you truly Shakespeare) when Annette Benning replied to 'Richard's' (Ian McKellen) inquiry as to what she thought of him i.e. "What thinkest of me madame?" Her laser reply "Thou art a bottled spider!" We have today in 2013 some 18 years hence the reality of a world continuing into the 'abyss' and mind you, not a moment of pause as the patricians ignore the free fall - (abortion, gay gay all over, SEIU, the usual entitlement idiocy) this is all Richard III is about. No - not the clutter and self induced suicide of the antagonist but the wrecking of decorum to slate the thirst of licentiousness and most of all what Hillary longs for 'power'. This is what the left loathes the most - use of satire to magnify the con - remember that great (for you west coast viewers i.e. 'blank' naw yawk) Jack In The Box TV ad some 12 years ago? The condescending monarch commenting on the sandwiches presented to him? "Peanut butter!" and the scullion daring to say "Where's the butter?" with the reply "SILENCE!" Obama is that king and get ready for more from the house hand 'barakska' with the 'Kung Fu Master with the GI Joe grip!" Only sorry one doesn't use that dwarf pock marked pig Joey Stalin or better yet that gonorrhea riddled 'attorney (now there's a career worth pursuing) Lenin.

    Granted, this Richard III is not for everybody due to the updated setting. However, I am not one of those who says that any adaptation that doesn't stick to the original setting and such is immediately rubbish. I do find that approach unfair, and have always thought considering that we are talking about different mediums here that adaptations should be judged on their own terms. Because on its own terms, this Richard III is excellent, not as good as Olivier's film but then again it is always a tough act to come up with something equal to film as amazing as Olivier's. The only things that I didn't like so much were that Edward's speech being cut meant that John Wood had literally nothing to do and Rivers' death scene for me didn't make sense. Also, Robert Downey Jnr's role is small and important, but at the same time I did find him too American and this jarred. However, the updated setting I had no problem with. As well as the fact that it's clear what the period is, the sets and costumes are beautiful and evocative, and Richard's entrance in a tank through the wall is incredibly dynamic even for a film adaptation of Shakespeare. Trevor Jones' music fits perfectly with the mood, haunting, poignant and tense all in one. The song set to Christopher Marlowe's words at the ball surprisingly likewise. The dialogue is as ever brilliant, of course there are cuts which is necessary considering the running time, but the dry yet inspired delivery of "well I'm not made of stone" really stands out. It was very effective at how Richard looked into the camera as if talking directly to the audience, this did help us to engage with the characters and the story. The story is daringly told and compelling, with a powerful and hilarious if not quite epic final scene and the touching morgue scene. Richard has always been a controversial yet enigmatic character, and Ian McKellen plays him superbly. He gives the character humour and charm yet also treachery and menace, and does so in a mesmerising way. Kristin Scott Thomas is a moving Anne, and Annette Bening is a fully-realised and sympathetic Elizabeth. Maggie Smith commands her scenes in whatever scene she appears in, and Jim Broadbent's Buckingham is wonderfully sly. Adrian Dunbar is effectively eerie and ruthless as is Tim McInnery, and Nigel Hawthorne affects as Clarence. Donald Sumpter's Blackenbury is nice to spot. All in all, an excellent Richard III if not for all tastes. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox

But just because these things can be done, the question is whether they should be done, or at least to acknowledge they are fundamentally altering the original. Unfortunately however, this practice of "contextual re-appropriation" for lack of a better term is often rationalized in such a way to make it more real for contemporary audiences. Again, that's fine, but it is a morphing of the original work into something else. Making Richard III into a European Nazi-sympathizer of the 1930's is reshaping Shakespeare's original vision into something quite distinctive from a 16th-century interpretation of a 15th-century historical figure. The bottom line: no matter what it is, and not matter how well it works on its own terms, it is not really Shakespeare anymore. Now granted, I am not saying it should never be done, but it is not Richard III as conceived by William Shakespeare. Consider the following: Could Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire be transferred to early Colonial America? Or how about Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" set in Elizabethan England, with Oscar as a tavern owner and Felix as a cobbler? Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" could be easily set in a host of other eras, such as the Middle Ages or even Antiquity. Or maybe a film version of Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer", keeping all the dialog, but set in the ghetto of New York in the 1970's. Again these "morphings" could possibly work on their own terms, but they wouldn't be Williams, Simon, Gilbert-Sullivan, or Twain anymore. They would be something else, and I think something would certainly be lost by placing them outside their contexts. Part of what makes them rich and appealing has to do with their original eras. Funny, though, no one would dare do this to Williams or Twain, but Shakespeare, Mozart and Wagner are constantly being re-contextualized. Maybe for myself after watching this film is that I never saw King Richard III of England. I saw a new character possibly inspired by Richard III but not Shakespeare's Richard III. Richard III lived in the late Middle Ages. He didn't have access to machine guns, tanks or telephones. He wouldn't have understood the terms fascism or communism. And he certainly would not have been smoking a cigarette. And to add one further point, there are a myriad of films set during World War II. Is it really necessary to take a Shakespeare play and put it there as well? As it is, there are not as many big-budget productions of Shakespeare plays produced after 1970 set in their original context as their should be, barring the wonderful BBC productions. There are plenty of films depicting Europe before, during and just after the Nazis. Because I prefer my Shakespeare, my Mozart and my Wagner produced in ways more closely adapted into what the authors had intended, which includes their historical context, I am not a good judge of this kind of material. Richard III to its credit may work on its own terms. But the use of the original Shakespearean language for a setting in the 20th century doesn't make much sense to me, and I don't really see the point. West Side Story, which was Romeo and Juliet set in 1950's New York, is a perfect example of how Shakespeare can be updated without messing with the original. Instead of the actors saying lines in Elizabethan English, new dialog was written which was contextually more appropriate for the mid-20th century, particular white gang members and Puerto Ricans in New York City. I think I would have preferred a newly written work with the plot inspired by Richard III rather than thrusting Shakespeare's blank verse across several centuries and putting it where it really doesn't belong.

    The 1995 film is a masterpiece. I'm not familiar with Richard Loncraine, the director, but the cast includes such luminaries as Ian McKellan, Annette Bening, Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas, and Maggie Smith. McKellan adapted the play to a modern England where it has become a fascist state. King Richard is a kind of Hitler, and the wars are fought with modern equipment. We are sucked into McKellan's version so completely that the anachronisms between the language and the time don't matter. McKellan is excellent as the mad would-be dictator, and the rest of the cast is lifted to his level. As with all Shakespeare's work, I recommend reading the work before seeing the movie. I'd suggest a copy of the Folger's or Arden editions (either or both probably available from your local library for free) with explanations of the more obscure words and phrases. The language of Shakespeare is beautiful, and the cast here is equal to the words. McKellan is a superbly evil and maniacal Richard as he murders his way to the throne, and his death is one of the best on film. He nails the role; he nails the look as a sordid, dissolute tyrant. This adaptation is similar to July Taymore's adaptation of "Titus Andronicus" to modern times in her 1999 film "Titus." Taymore and McKellan have both done excellent jobs of introducing modern elements into classical tragedies from Shakespeare. They showcase the incredible genius behind the works, still relevant today. A reminder that this film is an adaptation and that McKellan rearranged scenes, removed characters, and rewrote dialogue. I have not seen Olivier's "Richard III," but it gets high marks as the best on film for the true play, not an adaptation.

    First the good: the movement to modern neo-fascism was interesting, the twist on many of the speeches was fascinating (which is one of the pleasures of re-doing Shakespeare - viz. the interpretation), McKellen is great, and most of the supporting cast is solid. What I didn't like as much: some of the choices regarding what dialogue to keep and what to discard. Losing some of the opening soliloquy was unnecessary and a crime to Richard III fans. Benning and Downey Jr are not good in this - I like them in other films but here they sounded as if they were reciting lines that they had carefully memorized - very unnatural. But mostly where I think this falls short of the Olivier version is in the believability of Richard as a charmer. Olivier makes you believe that Richard could fool people. In this version, Richard is so blatantly evil that nobody could be deceived by him. Maybe they aren't supposed to be in this version but Richard III is one of the all-time great villains because he could charm people (a la Hannibal Lecter). Not here.

    This is a filmed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Film has different constraints than stage, not the least of which is time. A three or four hour theatrical performance can be divided with an intermission for audience comfort and concentration. A stage production can get away with hinting while a film has to re-create verisimilitude. A stage production strongly suggests 'as if' --hence actors taking a bow after the performance--while a film must mean: this is it, the film actors wanting to convey a death actually occurred. So in film lots gets lost in translation. But in this adaptation of Richard III in a fascist state, the sense of Richard giving himself over to total evil is not lost. Richard III is not Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth, or Brutus. These others are brought low by their humanity, by their human aspirations. From the get-go Richard plans on murder to become ruler, he announces to the audience that he will murder to get what he wants, and he stops at nothing to murder people who are in his way. The film doesn't miss this part of Richard. And for me, the final scene of Richard falling into what looks like the fires of eternal damnation made the movie worth the price of admission. The model of Richard III in fascist 20 century is not the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, not even Vidun Quisling who betrayed Norway to the Nazis. The model of Richard III is Adolf Hitler. The fact that Richard III has a sinister mustache to match Hitler's sinister mustache could not have been lost on the principals of the film. Richard III was a real historical character; Shakespeare derived his characterization from Sir Thomas More's "The History of King Richard the Third." Thomas More--the Man for All Seasons. Thomas More painted the blackest portrait of Richard III, a portrait only now being questioned, but in Shakespeare's day, Richard III was Villain personified. Hitler, like Richard III, was no fiction. Hitler's totalitarian state realized the death of millions of Jews, the death of millions of Russians, the death of European society. The German state had been turned over to the forces of evil as state policy. So Richard III,--Hitler--falling into the fires of eternal damnation seemed a fitting conclusion to those fascistic machinations. Many commentators of this film, film being democratic while theatre is elitist, seemed at a loss as to where to go for Shakespeare. SIGNET CLASSICS provides an excellent paperback resource with the play reproduced in Shakesearian English with footnotes to interpret the more obscure words Shakespeare might have used; plus every play has several interpretive essays to help guide the reader in thinking about the play. FOLGER Shakespeare LIBRARY from Washington, DC provides a similar service of paperback editions with each scene interpreted in modern English, difficult vocabulary defined, prints dating from the age of Shakespeare. PBS has filmed each and every Shakespearian play in its entirety; but again PBS provides a film of a stage performance and there are still niceties of film that stage can't reproduce; for example, the camera focusing on one person's face despite others being on stage. We live in a day and age which seems to have no moral constraints upon it; as Cole Porter might say: anything goes. Richard III--this filmed adaptation with that final scene of Richard falling into what could be construed by the audience as the fires of eternal damnation--reminds the audience that there is accountability and punishment for behavior. And Richard as a doppelganger for Hitler brings that message home.

    This dynamic adaptation of the Shakespeare play is reset in a kingdom that looks suspiciously like 1930s Germany and depicts Richard III as a ruthless fascist. The film looks marvelous, and it's got a great cast. Ian McKellen of course deserves the most praise for his performance as Richard, which he throws himself into with plummy gusto. But strong performances are to be given by all, including Annette Bening, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas and Maggie Smith. What I like most about the film is that it's very cinematic; it takes a stage property and actually ADAPTS it to the screen, rather than making a filmed version of a stage play. The "my kingdom for a horse" line gets quite a laugh in the context it's given here. Grade: A-

    In this version of Richard III the action has been moved to England in the 1930's. The move to this time period is flawless. While not as good as Titus (which is similar) this is a great film with fine performances. Maggie Smith as the Duchess of York steals this movie with her expert handling of Shakespeare. The scene she has with Ian McKellan (Richard III)by the stairs is amazing. Maggie Smith should have been a candidate for an Oscar for Best Supporting actress, a truly flawless performance. Annette Bening is very moving as Queen ELizabeth. Her best scene is in front of the building where her sons are being held prisoner by Richard. Krisitn Scott-THomas is riveting as Lady Anne. Ian McKellan is astounding as RIchard III. This is probably his best performance (even better than his performance as James Whale in "Gods and Monsters.") THe costumes and sets are also expertly done. Richard III is a near masterpiece.

    ....understand the left (marxist-leninists and lovers of Obama) always love films that depict the 'evil' with a khaki uniform and the hardware in tow - i.e. 'Hitler' as an convenient is such a 'lock' to embrace the college kids. What secured my affection was the remark (mind you truly Shakespeare) when Annette Benning replied to 'Richard's' (Ian McKellen) inquiry as to what she thought of him i.e. "What thinkest of me madame?" Her laser reply "Thou art a bottled spider!" We have today in 2013 some 18 years hence the reality of a world continuing into the 'abyss' and mind you, not a moment of pause as the patricians ignore the free fall - (abortion, gay gay all over, SEIU, the usual entitlement idiocy) this is all Richard III is about. No - not the clutter and self induced suicide of the antagonist but the wrecking of decorum to slate the thirst of licentiousness and most of all what Hillary longs for 'power'. This is what the left loathes the most - use of satire to magnify the con - remember that great (for you west coast viewers i.e. 'blank' naw yawk) Jack In The Box TV ad some 12 years ago? The condescending monarch commenting on the sandwiches presented to him? "Peanut butter!" and the scullion daring to say "Where's the butter?" with the reply "SILENCE!" Obama is that king and get ready for more from the house hand 'barakska' with the 'Kung Fu Master with the GI Joe grip!" Only sorry one doesn't use that dwarf pock marked pig Joey Stalin or better yet that gonorrhea riddled 'attorney (now there's a career worth pursuing) Lenin.

    Granted, this Richard III is not for everybody due to the updated setting. However, I am not one of those who says that any adaptation that doesn't stick to the original setting and such is immediately rubbish. I do find that approach unfair, and have always thought considering that we are talking about different mediums here that adaptations should be judged on their own terms. Because on its own terms, this Richard III is excellent, not as good as Olivier's film but then again it is always a tough act to come up with something equal to film as amazing as Olivier's. The only things that I didn't like so much were that Edward's speech being cut meant that John Wood had literally nothing to do and Rivers' death scene for me didn't make sense. Also, Robert Downey Jnr's role is small and important, but at the same time I did find him too American and this jarred. However, the updated setting I had no problem with. As well as the fact that it's clear what the period is, the sets and costumes are beautiful and evocative, and Richard's entrance in a tank through the wall is incredibly dynamic even for a film adaptation of Shakespeare. Trevor Jones' music fits perfectly with the mood, haunting, poignant and tense all in one. The song set to Christopher Marlowe's words at the ball surprisingly likewise. The dialogue is as ever brilliant, of course there are cuts which is necessary considering the running time, but the dry yet inspired delivery of "well I'm not made of stone" really stands out. It was very effective at how Richard looked into the camera as if talking directly to the audience, this did help us to engage with the characters and the story. The story is daringly told and compelling, with a powerful and hilarious if not quite epic final scene and the touching morgue scene. Richard has always been a controversial yet enigmatic character, and Ian McKellen plays him superbly. He gives the character humour and charm yet also treachery and menace, and does so in a mesmerising way. Kristin Scott Thomas is a moving Anne, and Annette Bening is a fully-realised and sympathetic Elizabeth. Maggie Smith commands her scenes in whatever scene she appears in, and Jim Broadbent's Buckingham is wonderfully sly. Adrian Dunbar is effectively eerie and ruthless as is Tim McInnery, and Nigel Hawthorne affects as Clarence. Donald Sumpter's Blackenbury is nice to spot. All in all, an excellent Richard III if not for all tastes. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox

    An anachronistic performance of Shakespeare's play, using most, if not all, of the lines from the original. As I understand it, some characters have been combined, but that's the nature of adaptations. It's basically the same play, in other words, only the settings and the costumes are from the 1930s/40s. I think that helps make the play less distant, though I don't have any firm evidence to back that up. Also, there are some fantastic performances here. Ian McKellen is wonderfully villainous as Richard. And if you want to see Robert Downey, Jr. stabbed in the back while "in the throes of passion", if you know what I mean, this is the movie for you. One last thing: I've both read and seen performances of multiple Shakespeare plays, and I would definitely recommend watching a performance, if you can, because this performance made it much easier to see all the Tudor propaganda that Shakespeare stuffed into the play (Richard is a hunchbacked, crippled sociopath who murders his way to the top and tries to marry his niece, while the Duke of Richmond, the future Henry VII, is a really nice guy whose heirs will, according to Shakespeare, bring peace to England; also, Richard is associated with lots of Hitler-esque paraphernalia). I enjoyed it very much.

    Now I have heard it said that the beauty about Shakespeare is that you can take it out of the setting in which the original play was written in, place it in a new setting, and it will still be a brilliant play. Now this is something that I do not necessarily agree with, namely because while up until the 20th Century this could be the case, the world has changed and a lot of the dialogue simply does not fit. Now the events of this film are set in the 15th Century, however the film itself is set in the 1930's. This in itself worked well (and as I argue, made for a very original film) but it falls apart at the end when Richard, after his jeep is bogged, cries out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse'. This, personally, does not really make any sense on the modern battlefield (not that horses aren't used, back in 2004 or 2005, I can't quite remember when, the capital of Kyrgistan was stormed by men on horseback), however I really do not want this minor problem destroy a good film. What this film is doing, is taking the story of Richard III out of the historical content and simply turning into a play about a tyrant. Now, it is debatable as to whether Richard III was actually a tyrant. He was the last of the Plantagenet dynasty, and was deposed at the battle of Bosworth field, after Henry Tudor defeated him and claimed the English throne for himself. This was considered to be the end of England's medieval period and brought not only stability to the country, but also ushered her into the Modern Era. Beforehand, England has just come out of a 100 year war with France (on the losing side) and this sent the country into civil war (the War of the Roses) in which the houses of Lancaster and York fought over the English Throne. The beginning of the play has Edward assume the throne after his predecessor, Henry VI is defeated in battle, however Edward is not on the throne for long and after he dies his son, Edward, takes the throne with Richard as Lord Protector. However, the barons vote to give the throne to Richard, and the crown prince and his brother then disappear. What is not clear is whether Richard was actually responsible for Edward's death and his children's disappearance, and whether his took the throne through manipulation and stealth (something which had been happening since the close of the 100 years war). What Shakespeare does though is turn Richard into a villain. It appears that Richard's deformity was a creation of Shakespeare, and the rumour that the princes were murdered in the Tower of London is also said to be of his creation. In fact, it is suggested that the princes simply vanished from public life after Richard was crowned. One might raise the point that the princes were imprisoned in the Tower of London. While these days the Tower of London is seen as a prison, back then this wasn't the case. The Tower, along with numerous other castles, were originally built by William the Conquerer to protect his newly conquered realm, and later reinforced by Edward III. The Tower of London in Richard's time was simply another castle, and it was only after this incidence that it inherited its reputation. It should also be remembered that in those days royalty, when imprisoned, were held in the castles, but not in the dungeons as we imagine. Castles were luxurious (and the Tower of London was no exception) and while one may have been imprisoned, imprisonment meant that one simply could not leave the castle. Another thing that stood out with this movie was how Richard came to the throne. We have the nobles and barons all pressuring him to take the throne, and in the end he relents. However, this film (and I suspect Shakespeare as well) manipulate this to make it appear that it was all a part of the plan between Buckingham and Richard. However, once Richard is on the throne, he becomes even more wretched and corrupt, in then end killing children and rejecting his friends, until he is left alone on Bodsworth Field. It is funny that when he does cry out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse', he really did not have a kingdom left to give. He had already lost. As for the horse, well if you led an army and you lost your horse, then you were in trouble. It is a shame that this film is very difficult to come by because I really do like this movie. I found it original, and the setting in the 1930's with Richard taking on a fascist mantle upon assuming the throne worked very well. While fascism did not exist in the 15th Century, and while Richard was strictly not a fascist, he was a tyrant (and least as the play portrays him) and to put him in the uniform of a fascist simply adds to the impression of tyranny that the play creates.

    King Richard III didn't live in the 1930's, and William Shakespeare didn't write in the 20th century. This historical figure lived in the the late Middle Ages, and Shakespeare wrote in the very late 16th and early 17th centuries near the end of the Renaissance. To snatch an historical figure 600 years out of his historical context and a corresponding play 450 years out of its theatrical and artistic context I believe loses the entire point of Shakespeare's original play. Taking bona fide masterpieces of theater and setting them down into another period is certainly in vogue these days, and victims have included other masterworks, including those by Wolfgang Mozart/da Ponte and even Richard Wagner. It is a practice I question, if only to say they simply are not the original works as intended by the artist-creators. They may be compelling and interesting but exist as a new work with elements of the original but they are NOT equivalent to the original. In this case, Richard III is set in the early 20th century during the period when the Nazis ruled Germany. Now, certainly any artist is free to do whatever he or she wishes with a play or opera which is in the public domain. But just because these things can be done, the question is whether they should be done, or at least to acknowledge they are fundamentally altering the original. Unfortunately however, this practice of "contextual re-appropriation" for lack of a better term is often rationalized in such a way to make it more real for contemporary audiences. Again, that's fine, but it is a morphing of the original work into something else. Making Richard III into a European Nazi-sympathizer of the 1930's is reshaping Shakespeare's original vision into something quite distinctive from a 16th-century interpretation of a 15th-century historical figure.

A three or four hour theatrical performance can be divided with an intermission for audience comfort and concentration. A stage production can get away with hinting while a film has to re-create verisimilitude. A stage production strongly suggests 'as if' --hence actors taking a bow after the performance--while a film must mean: this is it, the film actors wanting to convey a death actually occurred. So in film lots gets lost in translation. But in this adaptation of Richard III in a fascist state, the sense of Richard giving himself over to total evil is not lost. Richard III is not Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth, or Brutus. These others are brought low by their humanity, by their human aspirations. From the get-go Richard plans on murder to become ruler, he announces to the audience that he will murder to get what he wants, and he stops at nothing to murder people who are in his way. The film doesn't miss this part of Richard. And for me, the final scene of Richard falling into what looks like the fires of eternal damnation made the movie worth the price of admission. The model of Richard III in fascist 20 century is not the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, not even Vidun Quisling who betrayed Norway to the Nazis. The model of Richard III is Adolf Hitler. The fact that Richard III has a sinister mustache to match Hitler's sinister mustache could not have been lost on the principals of the film. Richard III was a real historical character; Shakespeare derived his characterization from Sir Thomas More's "The History of King Richard the Third." Thomas More--the Man for All Seasons. Thomas More painted the blackest portrait of Richard III, a portrait only now being questioned, but in Shakespeare's day, Richard III was Villain personified. Hitler, like Richard III, was no fiction. Hitler's totalitarian state realized the death of millions of Jews, the death of millions of Russians, the death of European society. The German state had been turned over to the forces of evil as state policy. So Richard III,--Hitler--falling into the fires of eternal damnation seemed a fitting conclusion to those fascistic machinations. Many commentators of this film, film being democratic while theatre is elitist, seemed at a loss as to where to go for Shakespeare. SIGNET CLASSICS provides an excellent paperback resource with the play reproduced in Shakesearian English with footnotes to interpret the more obscure words Shakespeare might have used; plus every play has several interpretive essays to help guide the reader in thinking about the play. FOLGER Shakespeare LIBRARY from Washington, DC provides a similar service of paperback editions with each scene interpreted in modern English, difficult vocabulary defined, prints dating from the age of Shakespeare. PBS has filmed each and every Shakespearian play in its entirety; but again PBS provides a film of a stage performance and there are still niceties of film that stage can't reproduce; for example, the camera focusing on one person's face despite others being on stage. We live in a day and age which seems to have no moral constraints upon it; as Cole Porter might say: anything goes. Richard III--this filmed adaptation with that final scene of Richard falling into what could be construed by the audience as the fires of eternal damnation--reminds the audience that there is accountability and punishment for behavior. And Richard as a doppelganger for Hitler brings that message home.

    This dynamic adaptation of the Shakespeare play is reset in a kingdom that looks suspiciously like 1930s Germany and depicts Richard III as a ruthless fascist. The film looks marvelous, and it's got a great cast. Ian McKellen of course deserves the most praise for his performance as Richard, which he throws himself into with plummy gusto. But strong performances are to be given by all, including Annette Bening, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas and Maggie Smith. What I like most about the film is that it's very cinematic; it takes a stage property and actually ADAPTS it to the screen, rather than making a filmed version of a stage play. The "my kingdom for a horse" line gets quite a laugh in the context it's given here. Grade: A-

    In this version of Richard III the action has been moved to England in the 1930's. The move to this time period is flawless. While not as good as Titus (which is similar) this is a great film with fine performances. Maggie Smith as the Duchess of York steals this movie with her expert handling of Shakespeare. The scene she has with Ian McKellan (Richard III)by the stairs is amazing. Maggie Smith should have been a candidate for an Oscar for Best Supporting actress, a truly flawless performance. Annette Bening is very moving as Queen ELizabeth. Her best scene is in front of the building where her sons are being held prisoner by Richard. Krisitn Scott-THomas is riveting as Lady Anne. Ian McKellan is astounding as RIchard III. This is probably his best performance (even better than his performance as James Whale in "Gods and Monsters.") THe costumes and sets are also expertly done. Richard III is a near masterpiece.

What secured my affection was the remark (mind you truly Shakespeare) when Annette Benning replied to 'Richard's' (Ian McKellen) inquiry as to what she thought of him i.e. "What thinkest of me madame?" Her laser reply "Thou art a bottled spider!" We have today in 2013 some 18 years hence the reality of a world continuing into the 'abyss' and mind you, not a moment of pause as the patricians ignore the free fall - (abortion, gay gay all over, SEIU, the usual entitlement idiocy) this is all Richard III is about. No - not the clutter and self induced suicide of the antagonist but the wrecking of decorum to slate the thirst of licentiousness and most of all what Hillary longs for 'power'. This is what the left loathes the most - use of satire to magnify the con - remember that great (for you west coast viewers i.e. 'blank' naw yawk) Jack In The Box TV ad some 12 years ago? The condescending monarch commenting on the sandwiches presented to him? "Peanut butter!" and the scullion daring to say "Where's the butter?" with the reply "SILENCE!" Obama is that king and get ready for more from the house hand 'barakska' with the 'Kung Fu Master with the GI Joe grip!" Only sorry one doesn't use that dwarf pock marked pig Joey Stalin or better yet that gonorrhea riddled 'attorney (now there's a career worth pursuing) Lenin.

    Granted, this Richard III is not for everybody due to the updated setting. However, I am not one of those who says that any adaptation that doesn't stick to the original setting and such is immediately rubbish. I do find that approach unfair, and have always thought considering that we are talking about different mediums here that adaptations should be judged on their own terms. Because on its own terms, this Richard III is excellent, not as good as Olivier's film but then again it is always a tough act to come up with something equal to film as amazing as Olivier's. The only things that I didn't like so much were that Edward's speech being cut meant that John Wood had literally nothing to do and Rivers' death scene for me didn't make sense. Also, Robert Downey Jnr's role is small and important, but at the same time I did find him too American and this jarred. However, the updated setting I had no problem with. As well as the fact that it's clear what the period is, the sets and costumes are beautiful and evocative, and Richard's entrance in a tank through the wall is incredibly dynamic even for a film adaptation of Shakespeare. Trevor Jones' music fits perfectly with the mood, haunting, poignant and tense all in one. The song set to Christopher Marlowe's words at the ball surprisingly likewise. The dialogue is as ever brilliant, of course there are cuts which is necessary considering the running time, but the dry yet inspired delivery of "well I'm not made of stone" really stands out. It was very effective at how Richard looked into the camera as if talking directly to the audience, this did help us to engage with the characters and the story. The story is daringly told and compelling, with a powerful and hilarious if not quite epic final scene and the touching morgue scene. Richard has always been a controversial yet enigmatic character, and Ian McKellen plays him superbly. He gives the character humour and charm yet also treachery and menace, and does so in a mesmerising way. Kristin Scott Thomas is a moving Anne, and Annette Bening is a fully-realised and sympathetic Elizabeth. Maggie Smith commands her scenes in whatever scene she appears in, and Jim Broadbent's Buckingham is wonderfully sly. Adrian Dunbar is effectively eerie and ruthless as is Tim McInnery, and Nigel Hawthorne affects as Clarence. Donald Sumpter's Blackenbury is nice to spot. All in all, an excellent Richard III if not for all tastes. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox

    An anachronistic performance of Shakespeare's play, using most, if not all, of the lines from the original. As I understand it, some characters have been combined, but that's the nature of adaptations. It's basically the same play, in other words, only the settings and the costumes are from the 1930s/40s. I think that helps make the play less distant, though I don't have any firm evidence to back that up. Also, there are some fantastic performances here. Ian McKellen is wonderfully villainous as Richard. And if you want to see Robert Downey, Jr. stabbed in the back while "in the throes of passion", if you know what I mean, this is the movie for you. One last thing: I've both read and seen performances of multiple Shakespeare plays, and I would definitely recommend watching a performance, if you can, because this performance made it much easier to see all the Tudor propaganda that Shakespeare stuffed into the play (Richard is a hunchbacked, crippled sociopath who murders his way to the top and tries to marry his niece, while the Duke of Richmond, the future Henry VII, is a really nice guy whose heirs will, according to Shakespeare, bring peace to England; also, Richard is associated with lots of Hitler-esque paraphernalia). I enjoyed it very much.

    Now I have heard it said that the beauty about Shakespeare is that you can take it out of the setting in which the original play was written in, place it in a new setting, and it will still be a brilliant play. Now this is something that I do not necessarily agree with, namely because while up until the 20th Century this could be the case, the world has changed and a lot of the dialogue simply does not fit. Now the events of this film are set in the 15th Century, however the film itself is set in the 1930's. This in itself worked well (and as I argue, made for a very original film) but it falls apart at the end when Richard, after his jeep is bogged, cries out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse'. This, personally, does not really make any sense on the modern battlefield (not that horses aren't used, back in 2004 or 2005, I can't quite remember when, the capital of Kyrgistan was stormed by men on horseback), however I really do not want this minor problem destroy a good film. What this film is doing, is taking the story of Richard III out of the historical content and simply turning into a play about a tyrant. Now, it is debatable as to whether Richard III was actually a tyrant. He was the last of the Plantagenet dynasty, and was deposed at the battle of Bosworth field, after Henry Tudor defeated him and claimed the English throne for himself. This was considered to be the end of England's medieval period and brought not only stability to the country, but also ushered her into the Modern Era. Beforehand, England has just come out of a 100 year war with France (on the losing side) and this sent the country into civil war (the War of the Roses) in which the houses of Lancaster and York fought over the English Throne. The beginning of the play has Edward assume the throne after his predecessor, Henry VI is defeated in battle, however Edward is not on the throne for long and after he dies his son, Edward, takes the throne with Richard as Lord Protector. However, the barons vote to give the throne to Richard, and the crown prince and his brother then disappear. What is not clear is whether Richard was actually responsible for Edward's death and his children's disappearance, and whether his took the throne through manipulation and stealth (something which had been happening since the close of the 100 years war). What Shakespeare does though is turn Richard into a villain. It appears that Richard's deformity was a creation of Shakespeare, and the rumour that the princes were murdered in the Tower of London is also said to be of his creation. In fact, it is suggested that the princes simply vanished from public life after Richard was crowned. One might raise the point that the princes were imprisoned in the Tower of London. While these days the Tower of London is seen as a prison, back then this wasn't the case. The Tower, along with numerous other castles, were originally built by William the Conquerer to protect his newly conquered realm, and later reinforced by Edward III. The Tower of London in Richard's time was simply another castle, and it was only after this incidence that it inherited its reputation. It should also be remembered that in those days royalty, when imprisoned, were held in the castles, but not in the dungeons as we imagine. Castles were luxurious (and the Tower of London was no exception) and while one may have been imprisoned, imprisonment meant that one simply could not leave the castle. Another thing that stood out with this movie was how Richard came to the throne. We have the nobles and barons all pressuring him to take the throne, and in the end he relents. However, this film (and I suspect Shakespeare as well) manipulate this to make it appear that it was all a part of the plan between Buckingham and Richard. However, once Richard is on the throne, he becomes even more wretched and corrupt, in then end killing children and rejecting his friends, until he is left alone on Bodsworth Field. It is funny that when he does cry out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse', he really did not have a kingdom left to give. He had already lost. As for the horse, well if you led an army and you lost your horse, then you were in trouble. It is a shame that this film is very difficult to come by because I really do like this movie. I found it original, and the setting in the 1930's with Richard taking on a fascist mantle upon assuming the throne worked very well. While fascism did not exist in the 15th Century, and while Richard was strictly not a fascist, he was a tyrant (and least as the play portrays him) and to put him in the uniform of a fascist simply adds to the impression of tyranny that the play creates.

    King Richard III didn't live in the 1930's, and William Shakespeare didn't write in the 20th century. This historical figure lived in the the late Middle Ages, and Shakespeare wrote in the very late 16th and early 17th centuries near the end of the Renaissance. To snatch an historical figure 600 years out of his historical context and a corresponding play 450 years out of its theatrical and artistic context I believe loses the entire point of Shakespeare's original play. Taking bona fide masterpieces of theater and setting them down into another period is certainly in vogue these days, and victims have included other masterworks, including those by Wolfgang Mozart/da Ponte and even Richard Wagner. It is a practice I question, if only to say they simply are not the original works as intended by the artist-creators. They may be compelling and interesting but exist as a new work with elements of the original but they are NOT equivalent to the original. In this case, Richard III is set in the early 20th century during the period when the Nazis ruled Germany. Now, certainly any artist is free to do whatever he or she wishes with a play or opera which is in the public domain. But just because these things can be done, the question is whether they should be done, or at least to acknowledge they are fundamentally altering the original. Unfortunately however, this practice of "contextual re-appropriation" for lack of a better term is often rationalized in such a way to make it more real for contemporary audiences. Again, that's fine, but it is a morphing of the original work into something else. Making Richard III into a European Nazi-sympathizer of the 1930's is reshaping Shakespeare's original vision into something quite distinctive from a 16th-century interpretation of a 15th-century historical figure. The bottom line: no matter what it is, and not matter how well it works on its own terms, it is not really Shakespeare anymore. Now granted, I am not saying it should never be done, but it is not Richard III as conceived by William Shakespeare. Consider the following: Could Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire be transferred to early Colonial America? Or how about Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" set in Elizabethan England, with Oscar as a tavern owner and Felix as a cobbler? Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" could be easily set in a host of other eras, such as the Middle Ages or even Antiquity. Or maybe a film version of Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer", keeping all the dialog, but set in the ghetto of New York in the 1970's. Again these "morphings" could possibly work on their own terms, but they wouldn't be Williams, Simon, Gilbert-Sullivan, or Twain anymore. They would be something else, and I think something would certainly be lost by placing them outside their contexts. Part of what makes them rich and appealing has to do with their original eras. Funny, though, no one would dare do this to Williams or Twain, but Shakespeare, Mozart and Wagner are constantly being re-contextualized. Maybe for myself after watching this film is that I never saw King Richard III of England. I saw a new character possibly inspired by Richard III but not Shakespeare's Richard III. Richard III lived in the late Middle Ages. He didn't have access to machine guns, tanks or telephones. He wouldn't have understood the terms fascism or communism. And he certainly would not have been smoking a cigarette. And to add one further point, there are a myriad of films set during World War II. Is it really necessary to take a Shakespeare play and put it there as well? As it is, there are not as many big-budget productions of Shakespeare plays produced after 1970 set in their original context as their should be, barring the wonderful BBC productions. There are plenty of films depicting Europe before, during and just after the Nazis. Because I prefer my Shakespeare, my Mozart and my Wagner produced in ways more closely adapted into what the authors had intended, which includes their historical context, I am not a good judge of this kind of material. Richard III to its credit may work on its own terms. But the use of the original Shakespearean language for a setting in the 20th century doesn't make much sense to me, and I don't really see the point. West Side Story, which was Romeo and Juliet set in 1950's New York, is a perfect example of how Shakespeare can be updated without messing with the original. Instead of the actors saying lines in Elizabethan English, new dialog was written which was contextually more appropriate for the mid-20th century, particular white gang members and Puerto Ricans in New York City. I think I would have preferred a newly written work with the plot inspired by Richard III rather than thrusting Shakespeare's blank verse across several centuries and putting it where it really doesn't belong.

    The 1995 film is a masterpiece. I'm not familiar with Richard Loncraine, the director, but the cast includes such luminaries as Ian McKellan, Annette Bening, Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas, and Maggie Smith. McKellan adapted the play to a modern England where it has become a fascist state. King Richard is a kind of Hitler, and the wars are fought with modern equipment. We are sucked into McKellan's version so completely that the anachronisms between the language and the time don't matter. McKellan is excellent as the mad would-be dictator, and the rest of the cast is lifted to his level. As with all Shakespeare's work, I recommend reading the work before seeing the movie. I'd suggest a copy of the Folger's or Arden editions (either or both probably available from your local library for free) with explanations of the more obscure words and phrases. The language of Shakespeare is beautiful, and the cast here is equal to the words. McKellan is a superbly evil and maniacal Richard as he murders his way to the throne, and his death is one of the best on film. He nails the role; he nails the look as a sordid, dissolute tyrant. This adaptation is similar to July Taymore's adaptation of "Titus Andronicus" to modern times in her 1999 film "Titus." Taymore and McKellan have both done excellent jobs of introducing modern elements into classical tragedies from Shakespeare. They showcase the incredible genius behind the works, still relevant today. A reminder that this film is an adaptation and that McKellan rearranged scenes, removed characters, and rewrote dialogue. I have not seen Olivier's "Richard III," but it gets high marks as the best on film for the true play, not an adaptation.

    First the good: the movement to modern neo-fascism was interesting, the twist on many of the speeches was fascinating (which is one of the pleasures of re-doing Shakespeare - viz. the interpretation), McKellen is great, and most of the supporting cast is solid. What I didn't like as much: some of the choices regarding what dialogue to keep and what to discard. Losing some of the opening soliloquy was unnecessary and a crime to Richard III fans. Benning and Downey Jr are not good in this - I like them in other films but here they sounded as if they were reciting lines that they had carefully memorized - very unnatural. But mostly where I think this falls short of the Olivier version is in the believability of Richard as a charmer. Olivier makes you believe that Richard could fool people. In this version, Richard is so blatantly evil that nobody could be deceived by him. Maybe they aren't supposed to be in this version but Richard III is one of the all-time great villains because he could charm people (a la Hannibal Lecter). Not here.

    This is a filmed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Film has different constraints than stage, not the least of which is time. A three or four hour theatrical performance can be divided with an intermission for audience comfort and concentration. A stage production can get away with hinting while a film has to re-create verisimilitude. A stage production strongly suggests 'as if' --hence actors taking a bow after the performance--while a film must mean: this is it, the film actors wanting to convey a death actually occurred. So in film lots gets lost in translation. But in this adaptation of Richard III in a fascist state, the sense of Richard giving himself over to total evil is not lost.

    Granted, this Richard III is not for everybody due to the updated setting. However, I am not one of those who says that any adaptation that doesn't stick to the original setting and such is immediately rubbish. I do find that approach unfair, and have always thought considering that we are talking about different mediums here that adaptations should be judged on their own terms. Because on its own terms, this Richard III is excellent, not as good as Olivier's film but then again it is always a tough act to come up with something equal to film as amazing as Olivier's. The only things that I didn't like so much were that Edward's speech being cut meant that John Wood had literally nothing to do and Rivers' death scene for me didn't make sense. Also, Robert Downey Jnr's role is small and important, but at the same time I did find him too American and this jarred. However, the updated setting I had no problem with. As well as the fact that it's clear what the period is, the sets and costumes are beautiful and evocative, and Richard's entrance in a tank through the wall is incredibly dynamic even for a film adaptation of Shakespeare. Trevor Jones' music fits perfectly with the mood, haunting, poignant and tense all in one. The song set to Christopher Marlowe's words at the ball surprisingly likewise. The dialogue is as ever brilliant, of course there are cuts which is necessary considering the running time, but the dry yet inspired delivery of "well I'm not made of stone" really stands out. It was very effective at how Richard looked into the camera as if talking directly to the audience, this did help us to engage with the characters and the story. The story is daringly told and compelling, with a powerful and hilarious if not quite epic final scene and the touching morgue scene. Richard has always been a controversial yet enigmatic character, and Ian McKellen plays him superbly. He gives the character humour and charm yet also treachery and menace, and does so in a mesmerising way. Kristin Scott Thomas is a moving Anne, and Annette Bening is a fully-realised and sympathetic Elizabeth. Maggie Smith commands her scenes in whatever scene she appears in, and Jim Broadbent's Buckingham is wonderfully sly. Adrian Dunbar is effectively eerie and ruthless as is Tim McInnery, and Nigel Hawthorne affects as Clarence. Donald Sumpter's Blackenbury is nice to spot. All in all, an excellent Richard III if not for all tastes. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox

    An anachronistic performance of Shakespeare's play, using most, if not all, of the lines from the original. As I understand it, some characters have been combined, but that's the nature of adaptations. It's basically the same play, in other words, only the settings and the costumes are from the 1930s/40s. I think that helps make the play less distant, though I don't have any firm evidence to back that up. Also, there are some fantastic performances here. Ian McKellen is wonderfully villainous as Richard. And if you want to see Robert Downey, Jr. stabbed in the back while "in the throes of passion", if you know what I mean, this is the movie for you. One last thing: I've both read and seen performances of multiple Shakespeare plays, and I would definitely recommend watching a performance, if you can, because this performance made it much easier to see all the Tudor propaganda that Shakespeare stuffed into the play (Richard is a hunchbacked, crippled sociopath who murders his way to the top and tries to marry his niece, while the Duke of Richmond, the future Henry VII, is a really nice guy whose heirs will, according to Shakespeare, bring peace to England; also, Richard is associated with lots of Hitler-esque paraphernalia). I enjoyed it very much.

    Now I have heard it said that the beauty about Shakespeare is that you can take it out of the setting in which the original play was written in, place it in a new setting, and it will still be a brilliant play. Now this is something that I do not necessarily agree with, namely because while up until the 20th Century this could be the case, the world has changed and a lot of the dialogue simply does not fit. Now the events of this film are set in the 15th Century, however the film itself is set in the 1930's. This in itself worked well (and as I argue, made for a very original film) but it falls apart at the end when Richard, after his jeep is bogged, cries out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse'. This, personally, does not really make any sense on the modern battlefield (not that horses aren't used, back in 2004 or 2005, I can't quite remember when, the capital of Kyrgistan was stormed by men on horseback), however I really do not want this minor problem destroy a good film. What this film is doing, is taking the story of Richard III out of the historical content and simply turning into a play about a tyrant. Now, it is debatable as to whether Richard III was actually a tyrant. He was the last of the Plantagenet dynasty, and was deposed at the battle of Bosworth field, after Henry Tudor defeated him and claimed the English throne for himself. This was considered to be the end of England's medieval period and brought not only stability to the country, but also ushered her into the Modern Era. Beforehand, England has just come out of a 100 year war with France (on the losing side) and this sent the country into civil war (the War of the Roses) in which the houses of Lancaster and York fought over the English Throne. The beginning of the play has Edward assume the throne after his predecessor, Henry VI is defeated in battle, however Edward is not on the throne for long and after he dies his son, Edward, takes the throne with Richard as Lord Protector. However, the barons vote to give the throne to Richard, and the crown prince and his brother then disappear. What is not clear is whether Richard was actually responsible for Edward's death and his children's disappearance, and whether his took the throne through manipulation and stealth (something which had been happening since the close of the 100 years war). What Shakespeare does though is turn Richard into a villain. It appears that Richard's deformity was a creation of Shakespeare, and the rumour that the princes were murdered in the Tower of London is also said to be of his creation. In fact, it is suggested that the princes simply vanished from public life after Richard was crowned. One might raise the point that the princes were imprisoned in the Tower of London. While these days the Tower of London is seen as a prison, back then this wasn't the case. The Tower, along with numerous other castles, were originally built by William the Conquerer to protect his newly conquered realm, and later reinforced by Edward III. The Tower of London in Richard's time was simply another castle, and it was only after this incidence that it inherited its reputation. It should also be remembered that in those days royalty, when imprisoned, were held in the castles, but not in the dungeons as we imagine. Castles were luxurious (and the Tower of London was no exception) and while one may have been imprisoned, imprisonment meant that one simply could not leave the castle. Another thing that stood out with this movie was how Richard came to the throne. We have the nobles and barons all pressuring him to take the throne, and in the end he relents. However, this film (and I suspect Shakespeare as well) manipulate this to make it appear that it was all a part of the plan between Buckingham and Richard. However, once Richard is on the throne, he becomes even more wretched and corrupt, in then end killing children and rejecting his friends, until he is left alone on Bodsworth Field. It is funny that when he does cry out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse', he really did not have a kingdom left to give. He had already lost. As for the horse, well if you led an army and you lost your horse, then you were in trouble. It is a shame that this film is very difficult to come by because I really do like this movie. I found it original, and the setting in the 1930's with Richard taking on a fascist mantle upon assuming the throne worked very well. While fascism did not exist in the 15th Century, and while Richard was strictly not a fascist, he was a tyrant (and least as the play portrays him) and to put him in the uniform of a fascist simply adds to the impression of tyranny that the play creates.

    King Richard III didn't live in the 1930's, and William Shakespeare didn't write in the 20th century. This historical figure lived in the the late Middle Ages, and Shakespeare wrote in the very late 16th and early 17th centuries near the end of the Renaissance. To snatch an historical figure 600 years out of his historical context and a corresponding play 450 years out of its theatrical and artistic context I believe loses the entire point of Shakespeare's original play. Taking bona fide masterpieces of theater and setting them down into another period is certainly in vogue these days, and victims have included other masterworks, including those by Wolfgang Mozart/da Ponte and even Richard Wagner. It is a practice I question, if only to say they simply are not the original works as intended by the artist-creators. They may be compelling and interesting but exist as a new work with elements of the original but they are NOT equivalent to the original. In this case, Richard III is set in the early 20th century during the period when the Nazis ruled Germany. Now, certainly any artist is free to do whatever he or she wishes with a play or opera which is in the public domain. But just because these things can be done, the question is whether they should be done, or at least to acknowledge they are fundamentally altering the original. Unfortunately however, this practice of "contextual re-appropriation" for lack of a better term is often rationalized in such a way to make it more real for contemporary audiences. Again, that's fine, but it is a morphing of the original work into something else. Making Richard III into a European Nazi-sympathizer of the 1930's is reshaping Shakespeare's original vision into something quite distinctive from a 16th-century interpretation of a 15th-century historical figure. The bottom line: no matter what it is, and not matter how well it works on its own terms, it is not really Shakespeare anymore. Now granted, I am not saying it should never be done, but it is not Richard III as conceived by William Shakespeare. Consider the following: Could Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire be transferred to early Colonial America? Or how about Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" set in Elizabethan England, with Oscar as a tavern owner and Felix as a cobbler? Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" could be easily set in a host of other eras, such as the Middle Ages or even Antiquity. Or maybe a film version of Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer", keeping all the dialog, but set in the ghetto of New York in the 1970's. Again these "morphings" could possibly work on their own terms, but they wouldn't be Williams, Simon, Gilbert-Sullivan, or Twain anymore. They would be something else, and I think something would certainly be lost by placing them outside their contexts. Part of what makes them rich and appealing has to do with their original eras. Funny, though, no one would dare do this to Williams or Twain, but Shakespeare, Mozart and Wagner are constantly being re-contextualized. Maybe for myself after watching this film is that I never saw King Richard III of England. I saw a new character possibly inspired by Richard III but not Shakespeare's Richard III. Richard III lived in the late Middle Ages. He didn't have access to machine guns, tanks or telephones. He wouldn't have understood the terms fascism or communism. And he certainly would not have been smoking a cigarette. And to add one further point, there are a myriad of films set during World War II. Is it really necessary to take a Shakespeare play and put it there as well? As it is, there are not as many big-budget productions of Shakespeare plays produced after 1970 set in their original context as their should be, barring the wonderful BBC productions. There are plenty of films depicting Europe before, during and just after the Nazis. Because I prefer my Shakespeare, my Mozart and my Wagner produced in ways more closely adapted into what the authors had intended, which includes their historical context, I am not a good judge of this kind of material. Richard III to its credit may work on its own terms. But the use of the original Shakespearean language for a setting in the 20th century doesn't make much sense to me, and I don't really see the point. West Side Story, which was Romeo and Juliet set in 1950's New York, is a perfect example of how Shakespeare can be updated without messing with the original. Instead of the actors saying lines in Elizabethan English, new dialog was written which was contextually more appropriate for the mid-20th century, particular white gang members and Puerto Ricans in New York City. I think I would have preferred a newly written work with the plot inspired by Richard III rather than thrusting Shakespeare's blank verse across several centuries and putting it where it really doesn't belong.

    The 1995 film is a masterpiece. I'm not familiar with Richard Loncraine, the director, but the cast includes such luminaries as Ian McKellan, Annette Bening, Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas, and Maggie Smith. McKellan adapted the play to a modern England where it has become a fascist state. King Richard is a kind of Hitler, and the wars are fought with modern equipment. We are sucked into McKellan's version so completely that the anachronisms between the language and the time don't matter. McKellan is excellent as the mad would-be dictator, and the rest of the cast is lifted to his level. As with all Shakespeare's work, I recommend reading the work before seeing the movie. I'd suggest a copy of the Folger's or Arden editions (either or both probably available from your local library for free) with explanations of the more obscure words and phrases. The language of Shakespeare is beautiful, and the cast here is equal to the words. McKellan is a superbly evil and maniacal Richard as he murders his way to the throne, and his death is one of the best on film. He nails the role; he nails the look as a sordid, dissolute tyrant. This adaptation is similar to July Taymore's adaptation of "Titus Andronicus" to modern times in her 1999 film "Titus." Taymore and McKellan have both done excellent jobs of introducing modern elements into classical tragedies from Shakespeare. They showcase the incredible genius behind the works, still relevant today. A reminder that this film is an adaptation and that McKellan rearranged scenes, removed characters, and rewrote dialogue. I have not seen Olivier's "Richard III," but it gets high marks as the best on film for the true play, not an adaptation.

    First the good: the movement to modern neo-fascism was interesting, the twist on many of the speeches was fascinating (which is one of the pleasures of re-doing Shakespeare - viz. the interpretation), McKellen is great, and most of the supporting cast is solid. What I didn't like as much: some of the choices regarding what dialogue to keep and what to discard. Losing some of the opening soliloquy was unnecessary and a crime to Richard III fans. Benning and Downey Jr are not good in this - I like them in other films but here they sounded as if they were reciting lines that they had carefully memorized - very unnatural. But mostly where I think this falls short of the Olivier version is in the believability of Richard as a charmer. Olivier makes you believe that Richard could fool people. In this version, Richard is so blatantly evil that nobody could be deceived by him. Maybe they aren't supposed to be in this version but Richard III is one of the all-time great villains because he could charm people (a la Hannibal Lecter). Not here.

    This is a filmed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Film has different constraints than stage, not the least of which is time. A three or four hour theatrical performance can be divided with an intermission for audience comfort and concentration. A stage production can get away with hinting while a film has to re-create verisimilitude. A stage production strongly suggests 'as if' --hence actors taking a bow after the performance--while a film must mean: this is it, the film actors wanting to convey a death actually occurred. So in film lots gets lost in translation. But in this adaptation of Richard III in a fascist state, the sense of Richard giving himself over to total evil is not lost. Richard III is not Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth, or Brutus. These others are brought low by their humanity, by their human aspirations. From the get-go Richard plans on murder to become ruler, he announces to the audience that he will murder to get what he wants, and he stops at nothing to murder people who are in his way. The film doesn't miss this part of Richard. And for me, the final scene of Richard falling into what looks like the fires of eternal damnation made the movie worth the price of admission. The model of Richard III in fascist 20 century is not the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, not even Vidun Quisling who betrayed Norway to the Nazis. The model of Richard III is Adolf Hitler. The fact that Richard III has a sinister mustache to match Hitler's sinister mustache could not have been lost on the principals of the film. Richard III was a real historical character; Shakespeare derived his characterization from Sir Thomas More's "The History of King Richard the Third." Thomas More--the Man for All Seasons. Thomas More painted the blackest portrait of Richard III, a portrait only now being questioned, but in Shakespeare's day, Richard III was Villain personified. Hitler, like Richard III, was no fiction. Hitler's totalitarian state realized the death of millions of Jews, the death of millions of Russians, the death of European society. The German state had been turned over to the forces of evil as state policy. So Richard III,--Hitler--falling into the fires of eternal damnation seemed a fitting conclusion to those fascistic machinations. Many commentators of this film, film being democratic while theatre is elitist, seemed at a loss as to where to go for Shakespeare. SIGNET CLASSICS provides an excellent paperback resource with the play reproduced in Shakesearian English with footnotes to interpret the more obscure words Shakespeare might have used; plus every play has several interpretive essays to help guide the reader in thinking about the play. FOLGER Shakespeare LIBRARY from Washington, DC provides a similar service of paperback editions with each scene interpreted in modern English, difficult vocabulary defined, prints dating from the age of Shakespeare. PBS has filmed each and every Shakespearian play in its entirety; but again PBS provides a film of a stage performance and there are still niceties of film that stage can't reproduce; for example, the camera focusing on one person's face despite others being on stage. We live in a day and age which seems to have no moral constraints upon it; as Cole Porter might say: anything goes. Richard III--this filmed adaptation with that final scene of Richard falling into what could be construed by the audience as the fires of eternal damnation--reminds the audience that there is accountability and punishment for behavior. And Richard as a doppelganger for Hitler brings that message home.

    This dynamic adaptation of the Shakespeare play is reset in a kingdom that looks suspiciously like 1930s Germany and depicts Richard III as a ruthless fascist. The film looks marvelous, and it's got a great cast. Ian McKellen of course deserves the most praise for his performance as Richard, which he throws himself into with plummy gusto. But strong performances are to be given by all, including Annette Bening, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas and Maggie Smith. What I like most about the film is that it's very cinematic; it takes a stage property and actually ADAPTS it to the screen, rather than making a filmed version of a stage play. The "my kingdom for a horse" line gets quite a laugh in the context it's given here. Grade: A-

    In this version of Richard III the action has been moved to England in the 1930's. The move to this time period is flawless. While not as good as Titus (which is similar) this is a great film with fine performances. Maggie Smith as the Duchess of York steals this movie with her expert handling of Shakespeare. The scene she has with Ian McKellan (Richard III)by the stairs is amazing. Maggie Smith should have been a candidate for an Oscar for Best Supporting actress, a truly flawless performance. Annette Bening is very moving as Queen ELizabeth. Her best scene is in front of the building where her sons are being held prisoner by Richard. Krisitn Scott-THomas is riveting as Lady Anne. Ian McKellan is astounding as RIchard III. This is probably his best performance (even better than his performance as James Whale in "Gods and Monsters.") THe costumes and sets are also expertly done. Richard III is a near masterpiece.

    ....understand the left (marxist-leninists and lovers of Obama) always love films that depict the 'evil' with a khaki uniform and the hardware in tow - i.e. 'Hitler' as an convenient is such a 'lock' to embrace the college kids. What secured my affection was the remark (mind you truly Shakespeare) when Annette Benning replied to 'Richard's' (Ian McKellen) inquiry as to what she thought of him i.e. "What thinkest of me madame?" Her laser reply "Thou art a bottled spider!" We have today in 2013 some 18 years hence the reality of a world continuing into the 'abyss' and mind you, not a moment of pause as the patricians ignore the free fall - (abortion, gay gay all over, SEIU, the usual entitlement idiocy) this is all Richard III is about. No - not the clutter and self induced suicide of the antagonist but the wrecking of decorum to slate the thirst of licentiousness and most of all what Hillary longs for 'power'. This is what the left loathes the most - use of satire to magnify the con - remember that great (for you west coast viewers i.e. 'blank' naw yawk) Jack In The Box TV ad some 12 years ago? The condescending monarch commenting on the sandwiches presented to him? "Peanut butter!" and the scullion daring to say "Where's the butter?" with the reply "SILENCE!" Obama is that king and get ready for more from the house hand 'barakska' with the 'Kung Fu Master with the GI Joe grip!"

In fact, it is suggested that the princes simply vanished from public life after Richard was crowned. One might raise the point that the princes were imprisoned in the Tower of London. While these days the Tower of London is seen as a prison, back then this wasn't the case. The Tower, along with numerous other castles, were originally built by William the Conquerer to protect his newly conquered realm, and later reinforced by Edward III. The Tower of London in Richard's time was simply another castle, and it was only after this incidence that it inherited its reputation. It should also be remembered that in those days royalty, when imprisoned, were held in the castles, but not in the dungeons as we imagine. Castles were luxurious (and the Tower of London was no exception) and while one may have been imprisoned, imprisonment meant that one simply could not leave the castle. Another thing that stood out with this movie was how Richard came to the throne. We have the nobles and barons all pressuring him to take the throne, and in the end he relents. However, this film (and I suspect Shakespeare as well) manipulate this to make it appear that it was all a part of the plan between Buckingham and Richard. However, once Richard is on the throne, he becomes even more wretched and corrupt, in then end killing children and rejecting his friends, until he is left alone on Bodsworth Field. It is funny that when he does cry out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse', he really did not have a kingdom left to give. He had already lost. As for the horse, well if you led an army and you lost your horse, then you were in trouble. It is a shame that this film is very difficult to come by because I really do like this movie. I found it original, and the setting in the 1930's with Richard taking on a fascist mantle upon assuming the throne worked very well. While fascism did not exist in the 15th Century, and while Richard was strictly not a fascist, he was a tyrant (and least as the play portrays him) and to put him in the uniform of a fascist simply adds to the impression of tyranny that the play creates.

    King Richard III didn't live in the 1930's, and William Shakespeare didn't write in the 20th century. This historical figure lived in the the late Middle Ages, and Shakespeare wrote in the very late 16th and early 17th centuries near the end of the Renaissance. To snatch an historical figure 600 years out of his historical context and a corresponding play 450 years out of its theatrical and artistic context I believe loses the entire point of Shakespeare's original play. Taking bona fide masterpieces of theater and setting them down into another period is certainly in vogue these days, and victims have included other masterworks, including those by Wolfgang Mozart/da Ponte and even Richard Wagner. It is a practice I question, if only to say they simply are not the original works as intended by the artist-creators. They may be compelling and interesting but exist as a new work with elements of the original but they are NOT equivalent to the original. In this case, Richard III is set in the early 20th century during the period when the Nazis ruled Germany. Now, certainly any artist is free to do whatever he or she wishes with a play or opera which is in the public domain. But just because these things can be done, the question is whether they should be done, or at least to acknowledge they are fundamentally altering the original. Unfortunately however, this practice of "contextual re-appropriation" for lack of a better term is often rationalized in such a way to make it more real for contemporary audiences. Again, that's fine, but it is a morphing of the original work into something else. Making Richard III into a European Nazi-sympathizer of the 1930's is reshaping Shakespeare's original vision into something quite distinctive from a 16th-century interpretation of a 15th-century historical figure. The bottom line: no matter what it is, and not matter how well it works on its own terms, it is not really Shakespeare anymore. Now granted, I am not saying it should never be done, but it is not Richard III as conceived by William Shakespeare. Consider the following: Could Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire be transferred to early Colonial America? Or how about Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" set in Elizabethan England, with Oscar as a tavern owner and Felix as a cobbler? Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" could be easily set in a host of other eras, such as the Middle Ages or even Antiquity. Or maybe a film version of Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer", keeping all the dialog, but set in the ghetto of New York in the 1970's. Again these "morphings" could possibly work on their own terms, but they wouldn't be Williams, Simon, Gilbert-Sullivan, or Twain anymore. They would be something else, and I think something would certainly be lost by placing them outside their contexts. Part of what makes them rich and appealing has to do with their original eras. Funny, though, no one would dare do this to Williams or Twain, but Shakespeare, Mozart and Wagner are constantly being re-contextualized. Maybe for myself after watching this film is that I never saw King Richard III of England. I saw a new character possibly inspired by Richard III but not Shakespeare's Richard III. Richard III lived in the late Middle Ages. He didn't have access to machine guns, tanks or telephones. He wouldn't have understood the terms fascism or communism. And he certainly would not have been smoking a cigarette. And to add one further point, there are a myriad of films set during World War II. Is it really necessary to take a Shakespeare play and put it there as well? As it is, there are not as many big-budget productions of Shakespeare plays produced after 1970 set in their original context as their should be, barring the wonderful BBC productions. There are plenty of films depicting Europe before, during and just after the Nazis. Because I prefer my Shakespeare, my Mozart and my Wagner produced in ways more closely adapted into what the authors had intended, which includes their historical context, I am not a good judge of this kind of material. Richard III to its credit may work on its own terms. But the use of the original Shakespearean language for a setting in the 20th century doesn't make much sense to me, and I don't really see the point. West Side Story, which was Romeo and Juliet set in 1950's New York, is a perfect example of how Shakespeare can be updated without messing with the original. Instead of the actors saying lines in Elizabethan English, new dialog was written which was contextually more appropriate for the mid-20th century, particular white gang members and Puerto Ricans in New York City. I think I would have preferred a newly written work with the plot inspired by Richard III rather than thrusting Shakespeare's blank verse across several centuries and putting it where it really doesn't belong.

    The 1995 film is a masterpiece. I'm not familiar with Richard Loncraine, the director, but the cast includes such luminaries as Ian McKellan, Annette Bening, Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas, and Maggie Smith. McKellan adapted the play to a modern England where it has become a fascist state. King Richard is a kind of Hitler, and the wars are fought with modern equipment. We are sucked into McKellan's version so completely that the anachronisms between the language and the time don't matter. McKellan is excellent as the mad would-be dictator, and the rest of the cast is lifted to his level. As with all Shakespeare's work, I recommend reading the work before seeing the movie. I'd suggest a copy of the Folger's or Arden editions (either or both probably available from your local library for free) with explanations of the more obscure words and phrases. The language of Shakespeare is beautiful, and the cast here is equal to the words. McKellan is a superbly evil and maniacal Richard as he murders his way to the throne, and his death is one of the best on film. He nails the role; he nails the look as a sordid, dissolute tyrant. This adaptation is similar to July Taymore's adaptation of "Titus Andronicus" to modern times in her 1999 film "Titus." Taymore and McKellan have both done excellent jobs of introducing modern elements into classical tragedies from Shakespeare. They showcase the incredible genius behind the works, still relevant today. A reminder that this film is an adaptation and that McKellan rearranged scenes, removed characters, and rewrote dialogue. I have not seen Olivier's "Richard III," but it gets high marks as the best on film for the true play, not an adaptation.

    First the good: the movement to modern neo-fascism was interesting, the twist on many of the speeches was fascinating (which is one of the pleasures of re-doing Shakespeare - viz. the interpretation), McKellen is great, and most of the supporting cast is solid. What I didn't like as much: some of the choices regarding what dialogue to keep and what to discard. Losing some of the opening soliloquy was unnecessary and a crime to Richard III fans. Benning and Downey Jr are not good in this - I like them in other films but here they sounded as if they were reciting lines that they had carefully memorized - very unnatural. But mostly where I think this falls short of the Olivier version is in the believability of Richard as a charmer. Olivier makes you believe that Richard could fool people. In this version, Richard is so blatantly evil that nobody could be deceived by him. Maybe they aren't supposed to be in this version but Richard III is one of the all-time great villains because he could charm people (a la Hannibal Lecter). Not here.

    This is a filmed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Film has different constraints than stage, not the least of which is time. A three or four hour theatrical performance can be divided with an intermission for audience comfort and concentration. A stage production can get away with hinting while a film has to re-create verisimilitude. A stage production strongly suggests 'as if' --hence actors taking a bow after the performance--while a film must mean: this is it, the film actors wanting to convey a death actually occurred. So in film lots gets lost in translation. But in this adaptation of Richard III in a fascist state, the sense of Richard giving himself over to total evil is not lost. Richard III is not Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth, or Brutus. These others are brought low by their humanity, by their human aspirations. From the get-go Richard plans on murder to become ruler, he announces to the audience that he will murder to get what he wants, and he stops at nothing to murder people who are in his way. The film doesn't miss this part of Richard. And for me, the final scene of Richard falling into what looks like the fires of eternal damnation made the movie worth the price of admission. The model of Richard III in fascist 20 century is not the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, not even Vidun Quisling who betrayed Norway to the Nazis. The model of Richard III is Adolf Hitler. The fact that Richard III has a sinister mustache to match Hitler's sinister mustache could not have been lost on the principals of the film. Richard III was a real historical character; Shakespeare derived his characterization from Sir Thomas More's "The History of King Richard the Third." Thomas More--the Man for All Seasons. Thomas More painted the blackest portrait of Richard III, a portrait only now being questioned, but in Shakespeare's day, Richard III was Villain personified. Hitler, like Richard III, was no fiction. Hitler's totalitarian state realized the death of millions of Jews, the death of millions of Russians, the death of European society. The German state had been turned over to the forces of evil as state policy. So Richard III,--Hitler--falling into the fires of eternal damnation seemed a fitting conclusion to those fascistic machinations. Many commentators of this film, film being democratic while theatre is elitist, seemed at a loss as to where to go for Shakespeare. SIGNET CLASSICS provides an excellent paperback resource with the play reproduced in Shakesearian English with footnotes to interpret the more obscure words Shakespeare might have used; plus every play has several interpretive essays to help guide the reader in thinking about the play. FOLGER Shakespeare LIBRARY from Washington, DC provides a similar service of paperback editions with each scene interpreted in modern English, difficult vocabulary defined, prints dating from the age of Shakespeare. PBS has filmed each and every Shakespearian play in its entirety; but again PBS provides a film of a stage performance and there are still niceties of film that stage can't reproduce; for example, the camera focusing on one person's face despite others being on stage. We live in a day and age which seems to have no moral constraints upon it; as Cole Porter might say: anything goes. Richard III--this filmed adaptation with that final scene of Richard falling into what could be construed by the audience as the fires of eternal damnation--reminds the audience that there is accountability and punishment for behavior. And Richard as a doppelganger for Hitler brings that message home.

    This dynamic adaptation of the Shakespeare play is reset in a kingdom that looks suspiciously like 1930s Germany and depicts Richard III as a ruthless fascist. The film looks marvelous, and it's got a great cast. Ian McKellen of course deserves the most praise for his performance as Richard, which he throws himself into with plummy gusto. But strong performances are to be given by all, including Annette Bening, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas and Maggie Smith. What I like most about the film is that it's very cinematic; it takes a stage property and actually ADAPTS it to the screen, rather than making a filmed version of a stage play. The "my kingdom for a horse" line gets quite a laugh in the context it's given here. Grade: A-

    In this version of Richard III the action has been moved to England in the 1930's. The move to this time period is flawless. While not as good as Titus (which is similar) this is a great film with fine performances. Maggie Smith as the Duchess of York steals this movie with her expert handling of Shakespeare. The scene she has with Ian McKellan (Richard III)by the stairs is amazing. Maggie Smith should have been a candidate for an Oscar for Best Supporting actress, a truly flawless performance. Annette Bening is very moving as Queen ELizabeth. Her best scene is in front of the building where her sons are being held prisoner by Richard. Krisitn Scott-THomas is riveting as Lady Anne. Ian McKellan is astounding as RIchard III. This is probably his best performance (even better than his performance as James Whale in "Gods and Monsters.") THe costumes and sets are also expertly done. Richard III is a near masterpiece.

    ....understand the left (marxist-leninists and lovers of Obama) always love films that depict the 'evil' with a khaki uniform and the hardware in tow - i.e. 'Hitler' as an convenient is such a 'lock' to embrace the college kids. What secured my affection was the remark (mind you truly Shakespeare) when Annette Benning replied to 'Richard's' (Ian McKellen) inquiry as to what she thought of him i.e. "What thinkest of me madame?" Her laser reply "Thou art a bottled spider!" We have today in 2013 some 18 years hence the reality of a world continuing into the 'abyss' and mind you, not a moment of pause as the patricians ignore the free fall - (abortion, gay gay all over, SEIU, the usual entitlement idiocy) this is all Richard III is about. No - not the clutter and self induced suicide of the antagonist but the wrecking of decorum to slate the thirst of licentiousness and most of all what Hillary longs for 'power'. This is what the left loathes the most - use of satire to magnify the con - remember that great (for you west coast viewers i.e. 'blank' naw yawk) Jack In The Box TV ad some 12 years ago? The condescending monarch commenting on the sandwiches presented to him? "Peanut butter!" and the scullion daring to say "Where's the butter?" with the reply "SILENCE!" Obama is that king and get ready for more from the house hand 'barakska' with the 'Kung Fu Master with the GI Joe grip!" Only sorry one doesn't use that dwarf pock marked pig Joey Stalin or better yet that gonorrhea riddled 'attorney (now there's a career worth pursuing) Lenin.

    Granted, this Richard III is not for everybody due to the updated setting. However, I am not one of those who says that any adaptation that doesn't stick to the original setting and such is immediately rubbish. I do find that approach unfair, and have always thought considering that we are talking about different mediums here that adaptations should be judged on their own terms. Because on its own terms, this Richard III is excellent, not as good as Olivier's film but then again it is always a tough act to come up with something equal to film as amazing as Olivier's. The only things that I didn't like so much were that Edward's speech being cut meant that John Wood had literally nothing to do and Rivers' death scene for me didn't make sense. Also, Robert Downey Jnr's role is small and important, but at the same time I did find him too American and this jarred. However, the updated setting I had no problem with. As well as the fact that it's clear what the period is, the sets and costumes are beautiful and evocative, and Richard's entrance in a tank through the wall is incredibly dynamic even for a film adaptation of Shakespeare. Trevor Jones' music fits perfectly with the mood, haunting, poignant and tense all in one. The song set to Christopher Marlowe's words at the ball surprisingly likewise. The dialogue is as ever brilliant, of course there are cuts which is necessary considering the running time, but the dry yet inspired delivery of "well I'm not made of stone" really stands out. It was very effective at how Richard looked into the camera as if talking directly to the audience, this did help us to engage with the characters and the story. The story is daringly told and compelling, with a powerful and hilarious if not quite epic final scene and the touching morgue scene. Richard has always been a controversial yet enigmatic character, and Ian McKellen plays him superbly. He gives the character humour and charm yet also treachery and menace, and does so in a mesmerising way. Kristin Scott Thomas is a moving Anne, and Annette Bening is a fully-realised and sympathetic Elizabeth. Maggie Smith commands her scenes in whatever scene she appears in, and Jim Broadbent's Buckingham is wonderfully sly. Adrian Dunbar is effectively eerie and ruthless as is Tim McInnery, and Nigel Hawthorne affects as Clarence. Donald Sumpter's Blackenbury is nice to spot. All in all, an excellent Richard III if not for all tastes. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox

    An anachronistic performance of Shakespeare's play, using most, if not all, of the lines from the original. As I understand it, some characters have been combined, but that's the nature of adaptations. It's basically the same play, in other words, only the settings and the costumes are from the 1930s/40s. I think that helps make the play less distant, though I don't have any firm evidence to back that up. Also, there are some fantastic performances here. Ian McKellen is wonderfully villainous as Richard. And if you want to see Robert Downey, Jr. stabbed in the back while "in the throes of passion", if you know what I mean, this is the movie for you. One last thing: I've both read and seen performances of multiple Shakespeare plays, and I would definitely recommend watching a performance, if you can, because this performance made it much easier to see all the Tudor propaganda that Shakespeare stuffed into the play (Richard is a hunchbacked, crippled sociopath who murders his way to the top and tries to marry his niece, while the Duke of Richmond, the future Henry VII, is a really nice guy whose heirs will, according to Shakespeare, bring peace to England; also, Richard is associated with lots of Hitler-esque paraphernalia). I enjoyed it very much.

    Now I have heard it said that the beauty about Shakespeare is that you can take it out of the setting in which the original play was written in, place it in a new setting, and it will still be a brilliant play. Now this is something that I do not necessarily agree with, namely because while up until the 20th Century this could be the case, the world has changed and a lot of the dialogue simply does not fit. Now the events of this film are set in the 15th Century, however the film itself is set in the 1930's. This in itself worked well (and as I argue, made for a very original film) but it falls apart at the end when Richard, after his jeep is bogged, cries out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse'. This, personally, does not really make any sense on the modern battlefield (not that horses aren't used, back in 2004 or 2005, I can't quite remember when, the capital of Kyrgistan was stormed by men on horseback), however I really do not want this minor problem destroy a good film. What this film is doing, is taking the story of Richard III out of the historical content and simply turning into a play about a tyrant. Now, it is debatable as to whether Richard III was actually a tyrant. He was the last of the Plantagenet dynasty, and was deposed at the battle of Bosworth field, after Henry Tudor defeated him and claimed the English throne for himself. This was considered to be the end of England's medieval period and brought not only stability to the country, but also ushered her into the Modern Era. Beforehand, England has just come out of a 100 year war with France (on the losing side) and this sent the country into civil war (the War of the Roses) in which the houses of Lancaster and York fought over the English Throne. The beginning of the play has Edward assume the throne after his predecessor, Henry VI is defeated in battle, however Edward is not on the throne for long and after he dies his son, Edward, takes the throne with Richard as Lord Protector. However, the barons vote to give the throne to Richard, and the crown prince and his brother then disappear. What is not clear is whether Richard was actually responsible for Edward's death and his children's disappearance, and whether his took the throne through manipulation and stealth (something which had been happening since the close of the 100 years war). What Shakespeare does though is turn Richard into a villain. It appears that Richard's deformity was a creation of Shakespeare, and the rumour that the princes were murdered in the Tower of London is also said to be of his creation. In fact, it is suggested that the princes simply vanished from public life after Richard was crowned. One might raise the point that the princes were imprisoned in the Tower of London. While these days the Tower of London is seen as a prison, back then this wasn't the case. The Tower, along with numerous other castles, were originally built by William the Conquerer to protect his newly conquered realm, and later reinforced by Edward III. The Tower of London in Richard's time was simply another castle, and it was only after this incidence that it inherited its reputation. It should also be remembered that in those days royalty, when imprisoned, were held in the castles, but not in the dungeons as we imagine. Castles were luxurious (and the Tower of London was no exception) and while one may have been imprisoned, imprisonment meant that one simply could not leave the castle. Another thing that stood out with this movie was how Richard came to the throne. We have the nobles and barons all pressuring him to take the throne, and in the end he relents. However, this film (and I suspect Shakespeare as well) manipulate this to make it appear that it was all a part of the plan between Buckingham and Richard. However, once Richard is on the throne, he becomes even more wretched and corrupt, in then end killing children and rejecting his friends, until he is left alone on Bodsworth Field. It is funny that when he does cry out 'a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse', he really did not have a kingdom left to give. He had already lost. As for the horse, well if you led an army and you lost your horse, then you were in trouble. It is a shame that this film is very difficult to come by because I really do like this movie. I found it original, and the setting in the 1930's with Richard taking on a fascist mantle upon assuming the throne worked very well. While fascism did not exist in the 15th Century, and while Richard was strictly not a fascist, he was a tyrant (and least as the play portrays him) and to put him in the uniform of a fascist simply adds to the impression of tyranny that the play creates.

    King Richard III didn't live in the 1930's, and William Shakespeare didn't write in the 20th century. This historical figure lived in the the late Middle Ages, and Shakespeare wrote in the very late 16th and early 17th centuries near the end of the Renaissance.

I'm not familiar with Richard Loncraine, the director, but the cast includes such luminaries as Ian McKellan, Annette Bening, Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas, and Maggie Smith. McKellan adapted the play to a modern England where it has become a fascist state. King Richard is a kind of Hitler, and the wars are fought with modern equipment. We are sucked into McKellan's version so completely that the anachronisms between the language and the time don't matter. McKellan is excellent as the mad would-be dictator, and the rest of the cast is lifted to his level. As with all Shakespeare's work, I recommend reading the work before seeing the movie. I'd suggest a copy of the Folger's or Arden editions (either or both probably available from your local library for free) with explanations of the more obscure words and phrases. The language of Shakespeare is beautiful, and the cast here is equal to the words. McKellan is a superbly evil and maniacal Richard as he murders his way to the throne, and his death is one of the best on film. He nails the role; he nails the look as a sordid, dissolute tyrant. This adaptation is similar to July Taymore's adaptation of "Titus Andronicus" to modern times in her 1999 film "Titus." Taymore and McKellan have both done excellent jobs of introducing modern elements into classical tragedies from Shakespeare. They showcase the incredible genius behind the works, still relevant today. A reminder that this film is an adaptation and that McKellan rearranged scenes, removed characters, and rewrote dialogue. I have not seen Olivier's "Richard III," but it gets high marks as the best on film for the true play, not an adaptation.

    First the good: the movement to modern neo-fascism was interesting, the twist on many of the speeches was fascinating (which is one of the pleasures of re-doing Shakespeare - viz. the interpretation), McKellen is great, and most of the supporting cast is solid. What I didn't like as much: some of the choices regarding what dialogue to keep and what to discard. Losing some of the opening soliloquy was unnecessary and a crime to Richard III fans. Benning and Downey Jr are not good in this - I like them in other films but here they sounded as if they were reciting lines that they had carefully memorized - very unnatural. But mostly where I think this falls short of the Olivier version is in the believability of Richard as a charmer. Olivier makes you believe that Richard could fool people. In this version, Richard is so blatantly evil that nobody could be deceived by him. Maybe they aren't supposed to be in this version but Richard III is one of the all-time great villains because he could charm people (a la Hannibal Lecter). Not here.

    This is a filmed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Film has different constraints than stage, not the least of which is time. A three or four hour theatrical performance can be divided with an intermission for audience comfort and concentration. A stage production can get away with hinting while a film has to re-create verisimilitude. A stage production strongly suggests 'as if' --hence actors taking a bow after the performance--while a film must mean: this is it, the film actors wanting to convey a death actually occurred. So in film lots gets lost in translation. But in this adaptation of Richard III in a fascist state, the sense of Richard giving himself over to total evil is not lost. Richard III is not Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth, or Brutus. These others are brought low by their humanity, by their human aspirations. From the get-go Richard plans on murder to become ruler, he announces to the audience that he will murder to get what he wants, and he stops at nothing to murder people who are in his way. The film doesn't miss this part of Richard. And for me, the final scene of Richard falling into what looks like the fires of eternal damnation made the movie worth the price of admission. The model of Richard III in fascist 20 century is not the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, not even Vidun Quisling who betrayed Norway to the Nazis. The model of Richard III is Adolf Hitler. The fact that Richard III has a sinister mustache to match Hitler's sinister mustache could not have been lost on the principals of the film. Richard III was a real historical character; Shakespeare derived his characterization from Sir Thomas More's "The History of King Richard the Third." Thomas More--the Man for All Seasons. Thomas More painted the blackest portrait of Richard III, a portrait only now being questioned, but in Shakespeare's day, Richard III was Villain personified. Hitler, like Richard III, was no fiction. Hitler's totalitarian state realized the death of millions of Jews, the death of millions of Russians, the death of European society. The German state had been turned over to the forces of evil as state policy. So Richard III,--Hitler--falling into the fires of eternal damnation seemed a fitting conclusion to those fascistic machinations. Many commentators of this film, film being democratic while theatre is elitist, seemed at a loss as to where to go for Shakespeare. SIGNET CLASSICS provides an excellent paperback resource with the play reproduced in Shakesearian English with footnotes to interpret the more obscure words Shakespeare might have used; plus every play has several interpretive essays to help guide the reader in thinking about the play. FOLGER Shakespeare LIBRARY from Washington, DC provides a similar service of paperback editions with each scene interpreted in modern English, difficult vocabulary defined, prints dating from the age of Shakespeare. PBS has filmed each and every Shakespearian play in its entirety; but again PBS provides a film of a stage performance and there are still niceties of film that stage can't reproduce; for example, the camera focusing on one person's face despite others being on stage. We live in a day and age which seems to have no moral constraints upon it; as Cole Porter might say: anything goes. Richard III--this filmed adaptation with that final scene of Richard falling into what could be construed by the audience as the fires of eternal damnation--reminds the audience that there is accountability and punishment for behavior. And Richard as a doppelganger for Hitler brings that message home.

    This dynamic adaptation of the Shakespeare play is reset in a kingdom that looks suspiciously like 1930s Germany and depicts Richard III as a ruthless fascist. The film looks marvelous, and it's got a great cast. Ian McKellen of course deserves the most praise for his performance as Richard, which he throws himself into with plummy gusto. But strong performances are to be given by all, including Annette Bening, Robert Downey, Jr., Kristin Scott Thomas and Maggie Smith. What I like most about the film is that it's very cinematic; it takes a stage property and actually ADAPTS it to the screen, rather than making a filmed version of a stage play. The "my kingdom for a horse" line gets quite a laugh in the context it's given here. Grade: A-

    In this version of Richard III the action has been moved to England in the 1930's. The move to this time period is flawless. While not as good as Titus (which is similar) this is a great film with fine performances. Maggie Smith as the Duchess of York steals this movie with her expert handling of Shakespeare. The scene she has with Ian McKellan (Richard III)by the stairs is amazing. Maggie Smith should have been a candidate for an Oscar for Best Supporting actress, a truly flawless performance. Annette Bening is very moving as Queen ELizabeth. Her best scene is in front of the building where her sons are being held prisoner by Richard. Krisitn Scott-THomas is riveting as Lady Anne. Ian McKellan is astounding as RIchard III. This is probably his best performance (even better than his performance as James Whale in "Gods and Monsters.") THe costumes and sets are also expertly done. Richard III is a near masterpiece.
