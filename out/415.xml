 <sinopse>
  Three orphan children strike gold in 1878 California.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Three orphaned siblings are forced upon confirmed bachelor Donovan (Bixby) in a 19th century boom town of Quake City, CA. After an earthquake shakes the area, the children find a large gold nugget worth tens of thousands of dollars. But their newfound wealth is causing more problems than it's solving, so they agree to "give" the gold to two bumbling outlaws (Knotts & Conway). But they only way they can get the gold is to steal it from the bank vault where it's being held for safe keeping.

    This film is absolutely fabulous and timeless. It is good old slapstick comedy and you do not need to worry about the content of this movie as this is old Disney. My children 7 and 8 really enjoined this movie. They laughed out loud and really got into the story. Don Knots always brings a light and funny air to any movie he has ever done and this movie is no exception. I think my children's favorite part is when the kids go riding down the hill in the old mine cart. Like any western movie there is a bar but the scenes in the bar do not emphasize the drinks so it was not bad in my opinion. This movie is truly a classic. I wish Hollywood would make movies like this again. Simple, clean, and funny with adorable characters. Heart warming as well. This movie was a real joy for my children, my husband and me.

    i've always enjoyed 'Apple Dumpling Gang' while growing up, but as a adult i've come to respect it as entertainment and really love it as Disney film. the kind that only Disney ever turned out. it has such a identifiable look and feel to it that was always uniquely Disney. Disney films always followed a kind of formula that made them uniform in relation to each other, but set them apart from the rest of Hollywood and filmmaking in general. 'Apple Dumpling Gang' has always been one of my top favorite Disney live action films because it epitomizes the Disney formula so completely while managing to stand on a certain individualism. it delivers completely on the Disney formula as well as offering so much more as a film. first off, in keeping with Disney tradition, it is extremely cute and huggable as well as elicitly wholesome family fare. the film also boast some good historic authenticity as well as a amusing story. it's all enhanced with superior photography and some sturdy direction from Disney stock director Norman Tokar. it also has some of the finest physical comedy ever put on to film. thanks of course to the genius of Don Knotts and Tim Conway's comic timing. their comedy duo carries out a weird feeling of predictability to their antics that is funny in a i-knew-that-would-happen way. i've never quite seen humour this funny where half the gag is the predictability of the results of their ill fated schemes. the kids also get into some pretty funny shenanigans as well. there are also some great bit parts by veteran western actor Slim Pickens, as well as TV favorites Frank Morgan, John McGiver and David Wayne. Pickens especially is hilarious as the gang leader who Conway accidentally has shot the foot off of. this film might not be ground breaking in terms of cinema technique, but it is very memorable as a piece of entertainment. and it's got more cozy heart than most movies as well as providing a certain amount of excitement and suspense. all in all the movie provides great family entertainment as well as great entertainment in general. it also provides very polished filmmaking that is contemporary even today. family films may get bigger than this with more explosions and CGI FX, but they really can't improve upon something like this. it is what it is and it's, it's own unique movie experience. unfortunately Disney doesn't make 'em like this anymore and neither does anybody else. fortunately, however, the Disney legacy has left us enough treasures like this gold nugget to indulge for years.

    Don Knotts and Tim Conway, two very big stars in their own right, teamed to do some very successful films mostly for the Disney Studio. Their comedy style was a lot like Laurel and Hardy, but in terms of individual stars teaming and being successful at both, the only comparison there is Crosby and Hope. The Apple Dumpling Gang follows the misadventures of these two lunkheads as they try their hand at the outlaw trade. They accidentally shot a really fierce outlaw in Slim Pickens and left him crippled in one leg and he's out for their hides. Paralleling that plot is that of gambler Bill Bixby who wins what he thinks is a consignment of freight in a poker game, but what he really gets is the delivery of three children. Being a roving bachelor Bixby naturally thinks the kids will cramp his style and they do for awhile. Willing to help is Calamity Jane like character Susan Clark who drives for the freight line that her father David Wayne owns. One thing I do so like about Disney films is the use of familiar Hollywood faces who were having trouble getting work. For example the brassy Iris Adrian, a little older and heftier, but still full of sass. But the film really belongs to Conway and Knotts. Conway is the Laurel like figure in the partnership, dumb and he knows it. But he has for a partner Knotts who like Oliver Hardy is full of grand schemes who when they blow up in his face will always blame is hapless partner. But in point of fact Knotts is just a bad planner. The Apple Dumpling Gang spawned a sequel in The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again where Knotts and Conway have even more hysterical misadventures. This one however and its successor are some of the best films Disney Studios made in the Seventies.

This is because Disney at this period had a story lab that was looking at what they considered narrative dynamics. We know much more today, but in that era, the threes came about because there was a deliberate weave of three genres.  The standard western where a Maverick-like character rides into town as a loner and wins someone's heart. Here it is the town redhead.

Given this establishment of the three genres, the script was designed around the rule of threes. For instance, the gambler saving the girl from the fire engine is for the family genre; the chase in the fire wagon at the end is standard Hopalong Cassidy fare; and the bit in the middle where the ladder is stolen while the fireman sleeps is from the Marx tradition.

    This is a fantastic family movie that kids can watch and enjoy and those of us who love the Tim Conway-Don Knotts combination will get our money's worth as well. I know the movie is about Bill Bixby and the kids but really, it's all about Conway and Knotts. They worked so well together that even if the rest of the movie was worthless, they made it incredible. If you watch the scenes with the two of them moving the ladder, you'd swear that all of that was storyboarded and choreographed, but according to Conway on the special edition DVD, they improvised all of it. The bit with Knotts drinking out of the beer glass and Conway trying to get a drink out of too is some of the greatest schtick in movie history. This is a great movie with a great cast including Slim Pickens and Harry Morgan and some of the finest character actors of the day. It's great and even if you don't like live-action Disney movies, you should still be able to appreciate the comic genius of Conway and Knotts.

    The Don Knotts/Tim Conway teamup makes this movie one of the all-time greats. How can anyone not laugh at this duo? They are fall-on-the-floor hysterical. The scene with the ladder is nothing short of brilliant! Once again, we have an example of a 1970s movie that features actual slapstick comedy instead of vulgarity or crudeness. Once again, viewers tend to forget the great character actors and their contributions that make this movie, if not great, at least above-average during the 1970s. I agree there are some horrible movies in the 1970s, but this probably is not one of the worst. Who can resist Harry Morgan's commanding voice? Or the actor (now long dead) who played the bank president? I feel that without these Walt Disney "fluff" movies, as a film buff, the whole 1970s decade would have been a dry desert. The reason is, what other movie studio could round up all the great actors of the period, put them together in a comedy, and make it work? Had these actors not been in these movies, we would not have seen them AT ALL! The children were irresistible, as well as the actors I have just mentioned. This anti-1970s-Disney attitude of viewers mystifies me. This particular movie was a lot better than some of Disney's other disasters, namely the sequel to this. Other Disney disasters: The Shaggy D.A. and Meteor.

    When I do a movie review I base it on what I think of the movie and not anyone else. This picture was made back in 1975 and is another great Walt Disney picture. Bill Bixby plays the role of Russel Donovan, Tim Conway plays the role of Gangster Amos Tucker, Don Knotts plays the role of Gangster Theodore Ogelvie, and Harry Morgan plays the role of Sheriff Homer McCoy. Donovan comes to town looking for a poker game while on his way to New Orleans. Donovan is approach by an old friend and wants him to claim what's on the stage that belongs to him. Donovan agrees only to fine that he's reasonable for three little kids. According to the local sheriff Donovan has to attend to these three little kids. After an earthquake shakes the area, the children find a large gold nugget worth tens of thousands of dollars. But their newfound wealth is causing more problems than it's solving, so they agree to "give" the gold to two bumbling outlaws (Knotts & Conway). But they only way they can get the gold are to steal it from the bank vault where it's being held for safe keeping. Just on the comedy alone I give this picture 8 weasel stars.

    This is a fantastic family movie that kids can watch and enjoy and those of us who love the Tim Conway-Don Knotts combination will get our money's worth as well. I know the movie is about Bill Bixby and the kids but really, it's all about Conway and Knotts. They worked so well together that even if the rest of the movie was worthless, they made it incredible. If you watch the scenes with the two of them moving the ladder, you'd swear that all of that was storyboarded and choreographed, but according to Conway on the special edition DVD, they improvised all of it. The bit with Knotts drinking out of the beer glass and Conway trying to get a drink out of too is some of the greatest schtick in movie history. This is a great movie with a great cast including Slim Pickens and Harry Morgan and some of the finest character actors of the day. It's great and even if you don't like live-action Disney movies, you should still be able to appreciate the comic genius of Conway and Knotts.

    The Don Knotts/Tim Conway teamup makes this movie one of the all-time greats. How can anyone not laugh at this duo? They are fall-on-the-floor hysterical. The scene with the ladder is nothing short of brilliant! Once again, we have an example of a 1970s movie that features actual slapstick comedy instead of vulgarity or crudeness. Once again, viewers tend to forget the great character actors and their contributions that make this movie, if not great, at least above-average during the 1970s. I agree there are some horrible movies in the 1970s, but this probably is not one of the worst. Who can resist Harry Morgan's commanding voice? Or the actor (now long dead) who played the bank president? I feel that without these Walt Disney "fluff" movies, as a film buff, the whole 1970s decade would have been a dry desert. The reason is, what other movie studio could round up all the great actors of the period, put them together in a comedy, and make it work? Had these actors not been in these movies, we would not have seen them AT ALL! The children were irresistible, as well as the actors I have just mentioned. This anti-1970s-Disney attitude of viewers mystifies me. This particular movie was a lot better than some of Disney's other disasters, namely the sequel to this. Other Disney disasters: The Shaggy D.A. and Meteor.

    When I do a movie review I base it on what I think of the movie and not anyone else. This picture was made back in 1975 and is another great Walt Disney picture. Bill Bixby plays the role of Russel Donovan, Tim Conway plays the role of Gangster Amos Tucker, Don Knotts plays the role of Gangster Theodore Ogelvie, and Harry Morgan plays the role of Sheriff Homer McCoy. Donovan comes to town looking for a poker game while on his way to New Orleans. Donovan is approach by an old friend and wants him to claim what's on the stage that belongs to him. Donovan agrees only to fine that he's reasonable for three little kids. According to the local sheriff Donovan has to attend to these three little kids. After an earthquake shakes the area, the children find a large gold nugget worth tens of thousands of dollars. But their newfound wealth is causing more problems than it's solving, so they agree to "give" the gold to two bumbling outlaws (Knotts & Conway). But they only way they can get the gold are to steal it from the bank vault where it's being held for safe keeping. Just on the comedy alone I give this picture 8 weasel stars.

    This film is absolutely fabulous and timeless. It is good old slapstick comedy and you do not need to worry about the content of this movie as this is old Disney. My children 7 and 8 really enjoined this movie. They laughed out loud and really got into the story. Don Knots always brings a light and funny air to any movie he has ever done and this movie is no exception. I think my children's favorite part is when the kids go riding down the hill in the old mine cart. Like any western movie there is a bar but the scenes in the bar do not emphasize the drinks so it was not bad in my opinion. This movie is truly a classic. I wish Hollywood would make movies like this again. Simple, clean, and funny with adorable characters. Heart warming as well. This movie was a real joy for my children, my husband and me.

    i've always enjoyed 'Apple Dumpling Gang' while growing up, but as a adult i've come to respect it as entertainment and really love it as Disney film. the kind that only Disney ever turned out. it has such a identifiable look and feel to it that was always uniquely Disney. Disney films always followed a kind of formula that made them uniform in relation to each other, but set them apart from the rest of Hollywood and filmmaking in general. 'Apple Dumpling Gang' has always been one of my top favorite Disney live action films because it epitomizes the Disney formula so completely while managing to stand on a certain individualism. it delivers completely on the Disney formula as well as offering so much more as a film. first off, in keeping with Disney tradition, it is extremely cute and huggable as well as elicitly wholesome family fare. the film also boast some good historic authenticity as well as a amusing story. it's all enhanced with superior photography and some sturdy direction from Disney stock director Norman Tokar. it also has some of the finest physical comedy ever put on to film. thanks of course to the genius of Don Knotts and Tim Conway's comic timing. their comedy duo carries out a weird feeling of predictability to their antics that is funny in a i-knew-that-would-happen way. i've never quite seen humour this funny where half the gag is the predictability of the results of their ill fated schemes. the kids also get into some pretty funny shenanigans as well. there are also some great bit parts by veteran western actor Slim Pickens, as well as TV favorites Frank Morgan, John McGiver and David Wayne. Pickens especially is hilarious as the gang leader who Conway accidentally has shot the foot off of. this film might not be ground breaking in terms of cinema technique, but it is very memorable as a piece of entertainment. and it's got more cozy heart than most movies as well as providing a certain amount of excitement and suspense. all in all the movie provides great family entertainment as well as great entertainment in general. it also provides very polished filmmaking that is contemporary even today. family films may get bigger than this with more explosions and CGI FX, but they really can't improve upon something like this. it is what it is and it's, it's own unique movie experience. unfortunately Disney doesn't make 'em like this anymore and neither does anybody else. fortunately, however, the Disney legacy has left us enough treasures like this gold nugget to indulge for years.

    Don Knotts and Tim Conway, two very big stars in their own right, teamed to do some very successful films mostly for the Disney Studio. Their comedy style was a lot like Laurel and Hardy, but in terms of individual stars teaming and being successful at both, the only comparison there is Crosby and Hope. The Apple Dumpling Gang follows the misadventures of these two lunkheads as they try their hand at the outlaw trade. They accidentally shot a really fierce outlaw in Slim Pickens and left him crippled in one leg and he's out for their hides. Paralleling that plot is that of gambler Bill Bixby who wins what he thinks is a consignment of freight in a poker game, but what he really gets is the delivery of three children. Being a roving bachelor Bixby naturally thinks the kids will cramp his style and they do for awhile. Willing to help is Calamity Jane like character Susan Clark who drives for the freight line that her father David Wayne owns. One thing I do so like about Disney films is the use of familiar Hollywood faces who were having trouble getting work. For example the brassy Iris Adrian, a little older and heftier, but still full of sass. But the film really belongs to Conway and Knotts. Conway is the Laurel like figure in the partnership, dumb and he knows it. But he has for a partner Knotts who like Oliver Hardy is full of grand schemes who when they blow up in his face will always blame is hapless partner. But in point of fact Knotts is just a bad planner. The Apple Dumpling Gang spawned a sequel in The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again where Knotts and Conway have even more hysterical misadventures. This one however and its successor are some of the best films Disney Studios made in the Seventies.

    During the California Gold Rush, gambler Bill Bixby (as Russel Donavan) wins something he wasn't anteing up for - three orphaned children. Declaring, "I'm a bachelor," and in, "no position to care for them," Mr. Bixby tries to unload the cute, but precocious Clay O'Brien, Brad Savage, and Stacy Manning (as Bobby, Clovis, and Celia Bradley). Bixby is unsuccessful, but since he is a latent family man, it really doesn't matter. Herein, he mustn't remain single, unlike in "The Courtship of Eddie's Father". So, tomboyish Susan Clark (as Dusty) provides the prerequisite motherly attention. Sheriff Harry Morgan (as Homer McCoy) insists Ms. Clark has womanly curves, having seen her "in a cloudburst." In the aptly named "Quake City", the kids find their stock rises after discovering gold in an old, abandoned mine. "The Apple Dumpling Gang" all very direct, and obvious, with bumbling gold-diggers Don Knotts (as Theodore Ogelvie) and Tim Conway (as Amos Tucker) effectively stealing the show. ***** The Apple Dumpling Gang (7/1/75) Norman Tokar ~ Bill Bixby, Don Knotts, Tim Conway, Susan Clark

    I'm usually appalled at how vintage Disney (of about 1940-80) ignored the basics of good storytelling, relying instead on cinematic gimmicks. Sometimes it worked, sometimes not, but when you just simply don't invest in good storytelling, you plant poison that somehow catches up with you. The primary reason that I remembered this fondly is that it was that rare project where lots of attention was spent on story structure. It is engineered for lowbrow effect of course, but that is beside the point. The two main story threads are:  a pair of hapless cowboy bandits, whose every move is comedic. It is simple Laurel and Hardy stuff with better facial expressions, and it is this that provides the entertainment value.  a story about the essential power of the nuclear family. It was still the 1950 notion, involving 3 children. They sacrifice wealth in exchange for parents, while Dickensian characters circle around. This provides  even now  the "nourishment" value. The two threads are interwoven in rather brilliant fashion with encounters between the two lost parties (children and adults) few and clear. They meet initially when the erstwhile crooks believe they are to be captured. They meet a second time when they form the Apple Dumpling Gang to steal the children's gold nugget. They meet only a third significant time at the end when the now mommy and daddy adopt both the children and the virtual children. There are many architectural correspondences that work with this and the internal cinematic references. For instance, we have a red "hook and ladder wagon" that we see three times after we are told that the town has one: when it is poses a threat to the little girl who is rescued by the hero; when its ladder is stolen for the bank robbery; and when that same little girl is kidnapped by the real robbers and a chase ensues. This is because Disney at this period had a story lab that was looking at what they considered narrative dynamics. We know much more today, but in that era, the threes came about because there was a deliberate weave of three genres.  The standard western where a Maverick-like character rides into town as a loner and wins someone's heart. Here it is the town redhead. He wears the standard gambler garb, and we track him at the important beginning where the terms of the story are established.  A comedy genre based on a combination of slapstick and Marx brothers quality dialog.  A family movie where what is now called "family values" are celebrated in a lighthearted fashion, but deeply acknowledged. Given this establishment of the three genres, the script was designed around the rule of threes. For instance, the gambler saving the girl from the fire engine is for the family genre; the chase in the fire wagon at the end is standard Hopalong Cassidy fare; and the bit in the middle where the ladder is stolen while the fireman sleeps is from the Marx tradition. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

    this western/comedy starring Don Knotts,Tim Conway,and Bill Bixby is a movie the whole family can watch.there's nothing offensive that i noticed.the thing is,though,the movie is not all that great.sure,it does have a few comedic moments(courtesy of Knotts and Conway),which provide some lite chuckles.but nothing great.the story is decent enough,though pretty unoriginal,and predictable.and most of the movie is slow,and maybe a bit too long.but if you go in to it with low expectations,you might actually enjoy it.i found myself mildly amused and entertained.for a lazy Sunday,you could do worse.for me,The Apple Dumpling Gang is a 5/10

    For some reason I don't have a lot to say about this film other then the fact that I liked it. That is a very boring and uninteresting review. But because my goal is to actually write reviews of movies that I see and not just become a bland passive movie watcher, I summit this review for others to look upon. Don Knots and Tim Conway are a perfect comedy due. Their both nerds in this film but Don Knots is the chief nerd in charge. They provide many wacky and comical moments to the film. But it really isn't a wacky slapstick film. It is a family comedy with a serious storyline. It is filled with touching and tender moments and has the classic storyline of a harden man who doesn't like kids and thinks only of himself only to have his heart turn gooey to the kids he's inherited by the end of the film. If that insight spoils the film for you, you haven't seen that many Disney films. If you want a fun time in the old west with touching comedic moments, that try the 'The Apple Dumpling Gang'
