    Not often that a decently produced film with some veteran actors gets a rating as low as this one. I watched it on Sundance channel with no advance idea of its origin. I am fairly convinced, however, that its flaws relate to the origins of its ingredients. First, you take some young New Yorkers who may or may not be on speed and get them to write a treatment for a film in small script in an even smaller notebook. Then you have them read it back to themselves after they have come down off their high, reflecting if possible on any chaotic dreams they can remember. Tell them to include all the stock New York characters and clich&eacute;s in no apparent order, jumping all over the place in time and location. Next you hire some really great local character actors who are between engagements to play some zany but recognizable types. Add a couple of actresses to play, respectively, a one-note looker and a drippy high school sweetheart type. Then cast one of yourselves in the main protagonist role as an aspiring writer with no real talent either as a writer or actor. A cute dog and maybe even someone's cat could provide added appeal. Then comes the hard part: getting someone short on IQ but long on money to finance the whole thing and let it go wherever it takes you. Marketing can come later. This turkey is saved by inspired character acting. I particularly liked Burt Young playing a role he has played many times, and I thought John Ventimiglia was terrific. Pity it had to be in this film.

    If you really want to laugh out loud this is your movie. There is no waiting for lunacy to begin. It is a quick moving, never boring parody. Michael Rapaport stole the movie. If his fast talking, high energy performance didn't have you laughing he at least had you smiling. The only disappointment was that there were not more scenes with him in them. There should have been more scenes with that rival business. James Woods in comedy... who knew...so funny. The gun battles are so well done. The enthusiasm of the shooters makes their lack of aim all that more funny. Anytime you see a gun... pay attention... you won't be disappointed. None of the shooters could hit the floor if they fell...too funny.

    Matthew Harrison and Kevin Corrigan have come up a quirky movie in which there are a lot of ideas. Some of them come across and others fail, but the film is worth a look because it has good performances. The first half of the movie has excellent pacing, as it moves quickly with all that's going on. Michael Rapaport makes an excellent appearance as Stretch. This is an actor that always delivers. He is always effective in whatever he plays. Kevin Corrigan's Redmond shows enough confusion as he moves through the different situations. It's not his best role, but having an interest in the film, since he co-wrote the screen play, might have had a toll on him. Linda Fiorentino, Lily Taylor, James Woods and Burt Young make great contributions in an assortment of New York characters. One of the funniest scenes is at the beginning of the movie when Uncle Sam steals the car and tries to get rid of the dog he finds inside. The shooting scenes are amazing because no one is shot, even at close range. Don't ever show this film to Quentin Tarantino, as he will probably have a panic attack!

    Despite a great soundtrack and the presence of the ever amazing Rappaport and Woods, this is another one of those moronic comedies where New York throws itself at the hero in an effort by the writer and/or director to show what a zany place it is. Yeah there's some other stuff in the movie that sucks too, but that's what's important. The trend for New York independent filmmakers seems to be "I don't need to be talented, I have NEW YORK!" Okay, to be fair, the movie has its moments. The flashback bit about why the one guy is called Wacky Jack was pretty amusing. The script isn't a story or a plot, it's a bunch of not-good scenes tied to each other by featuring the same character. One of the worst things is that there's no motive behind what the characters do. Uncle Sam has the kid deliver the drugs, why? If its so important why didn't Sam do it himself? Then the lead character lies his ass off in scene after scene with absolutely nothing to gain from lying. The guy falls in love with a flight attendant with neither of them having any reason to fall in love. The characters are a bunch of pawns for the writer to move around to see if he can get anything zany to happen. If you're easily amused or like watching bad indie movies because they make you feel smarter than watching bad mainstream movies, watch this. If you want to see what a GOOD light hearted crime movie looks like, watch Takeshi Kitano's "Brother". "Kicked In The Head" is the perfect example of why so many people hate offbeat indie movies: A LOT OF THEM SUCK. And a note to the director: Don't be afraid to excite, amuse, enlighten or entertain the audience now and then. Being boring doesn't make you a better filmmaker than the ones who can interest me.

    i was completely unaware of this movie when it was in theatrical release.i stumbled across it while watching on cable, and was immediately entranced.although it is edgy and modern, it has a similar allure for me as "a thousand clowns"(Jason robards,jr).new york city is a principal character(i admit that the locations in lower Manhattan are my old stomping grounds)which will usually add to the appeal of any movie. following REDMOND as he wanders from his lower east side home to bizarre beer distributor wars to incomprehensible black market deals to the haunting allure of an alcoholic flight attendant 'guardian angel' is funny,compelling, and repeatedly watchable. corrigan's efforts in front of and behind the camera are admirable.not to be missed is James woods' UNCLE SAM. he's a crazy incorrigible hustler who adds a wistful element to a lowlife character.

    I stumbled across this movie on satellite cable last one night. I was mesmerized - it was SO funny, so well written, and so underplayed. This little independent film has a lot going for it. Michael Rappaport has one of his best roles, James Woods plays a weasel like only he can... this movie is "Pulp Fiction" meets "Slacker" but a lot funnier... Guns, drugs, a lost dog, stolen cars, and LOTS of beer. Check this one out - if you like whimsical "small" films then this one is one for you.

    Man, I hate to say anything good about a film with James Woods in the credits, my personal choice as Hollywood's most irritating and unlikable actor since Victor Mature. However, he's only got a bit part, thank god, and he plays a consumate loser(not much of a stretch) so I will gleefully throw this one a prop. I don't know where all these lousy votes are coming from. I guess people tuned out early from all the existential angst our main character, Kevin Corrigan, is bleeding all over the place. Michael Rapaport is hysterical as an enthusiastic Irish gun toting beer distributor at war with more ethnic gun toting beer distributors. Basically the same role he played in True Romance but this time he's on crack. I think I counted about 700 beers in his refrigerator? I also noticed that nobody in this movie can shoot worth a s#@t. Spoilers ahead: Have you ever seen anybody empty an entire clip from a Desert Eagle at 3 feet and hit nothing but the sky? This movie is inventive, witty, and just downright hilarious. Worth a second look. The final scene had me simultaneously rolling on the floor and searching for an airsick bag. Funny funny funny! A solid 9 beer salute.

    "Kicked in the Head" is all about the Corrigan character, a twenty something man on a quest to find himself, and his involvements with a handful of quirky characters. This thin and ambiguous story, which was written by Corrigan, has a make-it-up-as-you-go feel and a screenplay which smells like an uninspired low budget indie. In spite of that and some annoying Hindenburg scene interjections, the film has an off beat, quirky kind of charm which may appeal, in some small way, to people with a similar sense of humor. Not for everyone, not for most, but maybe fun for some. (D+)

    First off for anyone who is a Kevin Korrigan Fan should know that Kevin co-wrote this movie with Matthew Harrison. They had been friends and he had called on Kevin to ask if kevin liked what he had got for a script about a poor bloke who had all of these mishaps. Kevin and him got the idea to use kevin's own misfortunes as the basis for the plot. Of course they had to fill it in with things that actually were not true to make things fall into place. Second- all-star cast. It won't get any better than Michael Rapaport as 'stretch', Lili taylor as 'happy', James Woods as his 'uncle sam' and Linda Florintino as the unlucky 'angel'. Just listening to Rapaport is a blast. He's the master of overlapping dialog and using his thick accent to give any scene a gritty urban feel. If you really think about it all of the characters have a very gritty urban sense to them. It's like you just know that these characters (must) actually exist in like N.Y or N.J or someplace (the only word that I can think of that really works here, that I'm really over using is)GRITTY, like thick in culture, or blue collar, backstreet, tough neighborhoods. I LOVE THAT!!!! Fast talking, overlapping dialog is the best. Another great movie with Kevin Korrigan is 'Walking in Talking' It also has another star who is amazingly humorous...Catherine Keener. If you want to see another awesome movie with Michael Rapaport at his (almost best, second to 'kicked in the head) performance, check out 'beautiful Girls'. They are the best, you should check them out! Enjoy.
