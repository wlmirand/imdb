 <sinopse>
  The day-to-day lives of a number of suburban Los Angeles residents.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  While helicopters overhead spray against a Medfly infestation a group of Los Angeles lives intersect, some casually, some to more lasting effect. Whilst they go out to concerts and jazz clubs and even have their pools cleaned, they also lie, drink, and cheat. Death itself seems never to be far away, even on a fishing trip.

    I'm glad I came across this Robert Altman movie set in Los Angeles. This is a long movie and has a lot of characters. Surprisingly if you concentrate it isn't too confusing who is who. It keeps you interested to see how things turned out for the different sets of people and piecing together the jigsaw is quite fun. The story isn't that predictable. Good mix of drama and bizarre comedy, even if some of the eccentric characters are a bit too way off. Liked the fishing trip. The only problem is you don't get enough development of the characters because there isn't enough time. Maybe a few less would have been better. The best part of watching this movie in 2013 is to see the terrific cast and how they have all gone on to so much in their careers. Also a bit poignant how some of them have aged in the 20 years since. Good to see Jack Lemmon in one of his later roles. Madeleine Stowe is lovely. Tim Robbins and Peter Gallagher are quite hilarious. Worth a watch.

    I love movies that intertwine multiple stories and connect everything together with a nice big bow. However this present was far to big and ran out of wrapping paper. As the clich&eacute; goes ''more is less''. This film could have used less to make it more. I do understand the importance of character development but redundancy can leave you disinterested in one or even all the players. In fact, some of them seem disinterested with themselves and the events occurring around or directly to them. They all seem to have to much restraint when it comes to emotions. Was this the point? If so, perhaps another hour should have been added to the film to better explain why. Did I mention this film clocks in at just over 3hours? I'm usually very patient when it comes to long films, but 3hrs felt like 5 in this case. This is not a bad film, but you can get the same kind of entertainment sitting on a park bench for a few hours.

    Based on the short stories written by Raymond Carver. A vast array of different characters, all of them by some degree connected with one another, are living in the suburbs of LA. Two major events unite all of them: the helicopters spraying bug spray at the beginning of the film (setting the scene), and the earthquake that takes place at the end (ending all of the stories). Robert Altman once again doesn't fail to show his extreme exuberance and brightness in each one of the storiesnot even when dark subject matter is exposed and never fails to connect all of them with a grace and craftsmanship that very few other directors have. Structurally complex, cynical in its narrative tone and content, nearly impeccable in its execution (each one of the actors and actresses give an outstanding performance, another proof of Altman's directorial skills and talent), Short Cuts remains an American classic, not only for its larger-than-life format, but also for the influence it had on many subsequent films, such as P.T. Anderson's Magnolia and Todd Solondz's Happiness.

    ...I try to tell from inside the universe of one single human being I become speechless because I cannot decide what to say and what to conceal. But not these three men who wrote this screenplay like a symphony between Bach and Jazz - and Mark Ishams music is the same kind - divinely brilliant. A novel? Two? Three, five? Or is this all hackneyed phrases? Is there a difference at all? Three hours full of moments I found myself smiling and slightly shaking my head at the same time. Never saw such a lot of 'perfect pairs' as in "Short Cuts"! The set dressing and costume design are straight to the point. Always winking. Don't worry about little earthquakes. Never get a breakfast in a diner without sunnies. And don't lose heart because of a body in the river... Simply enjoy - inside the prison of life :-)

    Ever see someone train a dog by pushing its nose into its feces? This movie is that for 3 hours (oui, you're the dog). You watch depressed/ angry/ unpleasant characters flit and interact. There isn't one redeeming/ uplifting/ positive/ life-affirming moment. OK, wait: In the end, Waits & Tomlin celebrate their poverty and alcoholism in a dreary trailer; Robbins has sex with Stowe and brings the dog back home; MacDowell & Davison eat pastries with baker Lovett after their child dies. Yeah, sorry, all upbeat stuff. Altman was a brilliant creator (3 Women, Nashville, Mash), capturing the American panorama and subconscious like no other director. Amazing in the range of topics he undertook. But over time he relied increasingly on dialogue to move his (lack of) plot forward. For many this skim was the invisible hand of meaning - "What is he trying to say here? It's obscure so it's gravid." Short Cuts has all the Altman signatures: annoying lounge music that permeates everything, overlapping dialogue, characters staring at fish or fixed objects as they think about the meaning of life, overlapping dialogue, near-constant elevator jazz, characters who talk from the script and to the camera but not to each other, overlapping dialogue. It might be a TV show that charms via "lives of idiosyncratic, tortured, neurotic characters intersecting & intertwining in a fictional yet all-too-real city of desire, failed dreams ...." The kind of thing where folks say "OMG, that is SO my family". Except for the bit where Penn beats a girl to death with a rock; or the guy who took pictures of the girl he raped and strangled. Scenes or characters you might care or wonder about are never fully-explored; other scenes (eg. Lemmon's description of boinking his son's aunt) go on and on. And on. You got it, and still it continues. Perhaps this is a mirror that forces us to confront our inner selves while we confront our outer lives, as we reflect on .... There's some nice acting: Robbins, Stowe, Tomlin, Jason-Leigh, McDormand, Davison, Gallagher, Chris Penn, Lili Taylor, more. But almost anyone can get good performances out of these folks. Meryl Streep - sorry, I mean Julianne Moore - does her usual "watch me, I'm REALLY acting" - especially when she is nude from the waist-down in the pre-BBQ scene. Andie MacDowell, as always, squeezes her lack of range into playing herself. Same for Robert Downey Jr. and Lori Singer. Jack Lemmon does the stuttering, mumbling, rolling fingers uh-uh-uh alky-monologue thing that he (incredibly) made a career out of. His understudy Tom Waits does a gravelly-voice version of this. Boy, imagine if Altman had filmed an 8-hour version of an O'Neil play where Waits and Lemmon talk about life as they drink in a bar on a rainy day. Various characters could come and go, talking about the rain as they walk in; the bartender, perhaps a jaded Brian Blessed, would comment as he refilled their glasses .... Whew. Carver seemed to have insight, albeit through a whiskey glass, into the human spirit. But this movie version of his stories seems as contrived as a HS play. Look at the scene where Penn & Jason-Leigh consider having sex; or the photo-mixup scene; or the funeral scene where the dialogue approaches an Ibsen play: Sven opens his front door and a woman outside says "May I come in? I'm yust in town and I want to tell your father's last words as he died from syphilis ... yah, I'm your sister; the maid is your real mother; and the bank president, see the insanity in my left eye ..." Oofta, people do jump in like that in real life. I got to page 3 of the reviews without reading anything negative about Short Cuts. I infer from this that viewers think a stage production where actors tell, but don't show, is good art. There it is. I gave it a 7 and considered an 8. Several parts were so irritating that I winced and squirmed so it's certainly effective. Two sidebars: 1. If you think Carver would be difficult to bring to the screen, see the excellent Jindabyne. 2. Altman over time became like his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Alan Rudolph - vague and insubstantial - whereas Rudolph's quirkiness grew into meatier work.

    Altman, as many have written, had a career that is pretty much evenly divided between hit and miss. While I have always enjoyed his films, to be totally honest and fair, not all of his work qualifies to the magnificent high standard of being Altmanesque. Altman loved jazz, and the best of his best work move like a brilliant jazz performance. To move along with his groove, to truly become part of the experience requires a certain presence of mind. Like the greatest jazz artists, there are those who enter into deep debates over which work is best: is Kind Of Blue better than Bitches Brew? More important? In the end, it does come down to taste and preference, and this would be my second favorite Altman film after the sheer perfection of Nashville. The films are like watching someone make a quilt, "bit by bit, putting it together" (as Sondheim said), with no one particular thread being more important than another, just a simple, glorious collection of threads pulling together to form one majestic piece. The perception that his films are "scattered" or "confusing" or "dull" because of that missing story line is, sadly, understandable: we are being fed a constant stream of Single Story at every turn, being easier to market and exploit. Altman, at his best, had no need of a single narrative line and on those occasions in which there is no semblance whatsoever of a single story arc AND he is moving at his best, he creates films quite unlike any other by any one. Both this and Nashville are invitations, seductive in their own way: there is no fourth wall in these works, while we watch them, it is as if they are watching us.

    By the time Robert Altman directed Short Cuts, in 1993, his style of interconnected and quirky characters in the format of a large cast was becoming trendy. The nineties would see other famous examples of this approach by big name directors, notably Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994 and Paul Thomas Anderson's' Magnolia from 1999. There was even a Simpson's episode in this vein in 1996 called '22 Short Films About Springfield'. Even though Altman was one of the inventors of this style, or grouping of styles, Short Takes suffers some from being in the age of such movies, rather than a monumental predecessor. Altman came close to perfecting the large, interconnected ensemble film in 1975 with Nashville. This film was more of a portrait of a unique city with its own music and culture and a portrait of the times rather than a character study or a gripping pot boiler. So the title made sense. Perhaps an even more accurate title would have been Nashville 1975. Altman excited audiences by making a large scale portrait of a time and place, full of complexity and brimming with interesting little stories and people. By 1993, the charms of these new developments were starting to wear off, and the nineties would sap the creative reservoir (and audience patience) of such sprawling films. Nashville is a better film---it cracks with energy and humor, it radiates a cynicism that was new in the 70's but is now commonplace. Short cuts fails to be a larger portrait as Nashville was. Nashville's true main character was the city herself. All the pieces fit to make a larger structure. This large structure may have been gaudy and odd, but it was worth building. Short Takes takes place in L.A. Suburbs, but is not about them. It feels like it takes place there because it was convenient, not because Altman had developed a Nashville-like interest in the area. The stories are thus highly reliant on their connections, though these can feel contrived. There is too much material here, even for 3 hours, to mine much real depth with individuals, and so the shattered pieces of a whole are hurt by never fitting into a larger structure. Nashville was 'weird' because it was about a city, Short Takes is 'weird' because it is about nothing. It seems appropriate that this movie came from the age of Seinfeld. Nashville was better and more innovative, but Short Takes was still on the front edge of the nineties trend of piecemeal interconnection dramas. It seems unfair that Pulp Fiction is so much more heralded and Magnolia is more remembered and loved. Why? Pulp Fiction might be more silly fun, and Magnolia might be by arguably the most gifted director of the three, but Short takes feels left behind by these films even though it was first, from a historical point of view. Part of this comes from the tone. The film is not touching or dramatic in the conventional sense. The viewer doesn't care about anyone in particular. We feel as upset for the girl killed by Chris Penn's character (she has only a few lines) as we do for anyone. Through its sheer fun Pulp Fiction makes you care about the characters in at least a passing way. Magnolia is a web of quirky, interconnected characters, but has more thematic and emotional focus. Short Cuts feels insincere at times, dramatically, and falls into clich&eacute;s which are amplified by the lack of time any one line of a character is given. The attempts at darkish humor fall flat or feel confusing as to whether they are serious or tongue in cheek. Despite a huge cast of huge names, the actors seem as confused and aimless as the audience. There are very good actors everywhere here and so sometimes good acting comes here and there, but there is a subdued feeling like all the talent has been handicapped. This is a good film if you are in a patient mood, but far from Altman's best work. Six stars.

    Another impressive Robert Altman ensemble piece, for the most part. Short Cuts brings us a look into the lives of an extensive number of Los Angeles residents, interconnecting in sometimes loose and sometimes more direct ways. We see doctors, singers, mothers, waitresses and plenty more, all done in the fluid and rhythmic fashion that one would expect from the man who brought us Nashville. Short Cuts feels very much like an L.A. film; there's a controlled chaos to it all that feels frenzied but in a strange way that lets you know that Altman is still behind the wheel. Over the course of the film we delve further into the lives of each individual, focusing on a few and exploring them deeper through Altman's heavy themes of morality and mortality (the film is based on a collection of short stories by Raymond Carver). It's a film that if it hits you right could get you doing a lot of self-reflecting on life and death, which is always a powerful thing to resonate within an audience. The most surprising thing about the film for me was how quickly it went by. Coming in at a running time of over 180 minutes, I was always quite intimidated by it and was expecting at least part of it to drag no matter how good the overall product was, but it flew by. Altman has this indescribable way to pace these epic ensemble pieces that make them feel so fluid and complete, keeping the focus on each character just long enough to unfold another layer but moving on to the next before it starts to drag. It's really one of the more impressive things about his capabilities as a director, how magnificently paced they are. For the majority of Short Cuts I was very impressed with everything that he was able to draw out of his cast; the emotions felt so genuine and, as he did in Nashville, the performances were mostly authentic and deeply lived-in. I don't think that it mixes the comedic and dramatic elements as well as it could have, but there was an understated quality to the dark themes that made it feel a lot more natural than if he had poured on the melodrama thick, which he easily could have given the material. Here he works with more established names than he did in something like Nashville, but there was a real lack of vanity from the actors, none of them allowing their prominence to overshadow anything else about the rest of the ensemble. Altman brings all of these characters together in a way that feels alive but not overly cinematic, expertly staged and paced...for the majority of it. There's a scene where Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine's characters get into an argument over a possible infidelity of hers, and it's around this scene that the film takes a bizarre turn for the worse. The performances that used to feel so genuine were all of a sudden desperately forced, the understated emotions that were allowed to build were now coming to the surface and were so melodramatic and shoved down the throat of the audience. It was as if Altman and the cast took everything that was working so well about it beforehand and decided to do everything in the completely opposite fashion for the final stretch. I struggle to think of a film that took such a dramatic shift, especially so late in it's game. By the time we reach the heavy-handed climax to bring together the universality of the characters, I wanted to scream at how desperate it all had become. It felt as though Altman had stepped down from his chair and let someone much less skilled than he come in and try to finish it, but they just hacked it to pieces. Short Cuts is a very good film for 150 minutes that is almost derailed by it's final 30.

    I saw this movie again last night and, like an old friend with which you had a bit of disagreement long ago but you are happy to see again, I found it most enjoyable. Well, enjoyable by an artistic, cinematic point of view. Certainly not by a human point of view since at the end, the shallowness and downright ugliness of some of the characters, came back to make me feel again that lingering subtle sense of depression at life being sometimes so unpalatable. That same bitterness at the back of your mouth after a not-so-honorable spree the night before. And yet the movie is one that you will never say: I've had enough of this. You do want to follow the different personas, their briefly brushing of self-contained lives, hoping a new story will develop, a redeeming character will appear. But no one enters from the left to shed light. Everyone is self-absorbed. I looked at the some of the other reviews to see if someone else had my same hunch and did not find any reference to what I think is Altman's inspiration for this canvas of American lives: Federico Fellini. Where La Dolce vita was a large fresco of a certain society at a certain point in time, here Altman wants to represent on a large, spread out mural a number of characters loosely connected or separated by their own materialism, hoping that, in the end, what the viewer sees is the colors and shape of a bustling city that can only be L.A. Where Fellini had a Ulysses-like character (Mastroianni) representing himself and his awe at the confusing life of a cynical old city on the verge of modern materialism, Altman does not have an himself watching and connecting the stories but tries to be more objective, more detached, letting the individual stories develop kind of casually. This is because the script does not come from him, from his own experiences ( as I understand the aging singer character is his only contribution to the plot) but from a number of short stories written by someone else. So, where Fellini is telling us of his own fears, surprises and expectations Altman is recounting someone's else story, a story that he is trying to tell not interpret, hoping that it will speak to the viewers by itself. So, if Fellini's fresco reminds me of The Triumph of Death in the cemetery of Pisa, scary, bigger than life and never to be forgotten, Altman's work reminds me of those many , beautiful murals one can see all over the world: busy, colorful, confusing and devoid of perspective but which one goes away from with a bit of bitter aftertaste for not having told a more decisive, clear message. An 8 nonetheless.

    I got to see this film for the first time this past weekend. I was interested to see how they would tie all the stories together and how smoothly it would flow. With so much going on and so many characters, I felt it did a pretty good job at it. The problem I had with it was that most of the stories were quite boring. Many of them never came to an end when the film was over. And, the ones that did, appeared to be quick fix endings to patch plot holes. It was fun to see all the actors and actresses in their prime. Many gave great performances. I just felt the writing was weak. I would like to see this film re-written and attempted again.

Jack Lemmon does the stuttering, mumbling, rolling fingers uh-uh-uh alky-monologue thing that he (incredibly) made a career out of. His understudy Tom Waits does a gravelly-voice version of this. Boy, imagine if Altman had filmed an 8-hour version of an O'Neil play where Waits and Lemmon talk about life as they drink in a bar on a rainy day. Various characters could come and go, talking about the rain as they walk in; the bartender, perhaps a jaded Brian Blessed, would comment as he refilled their glasses .... Whew. Carver seemed to have insight, albeit through a whiskey glass, into the human spirit. But this movie version of his stories seems as contrived as a HS play. Look at the scene where Penn & Jason-Leigh consider having sex; or the photo-mixup scene; or the funeral scene where the dialogue approaches an Ibsen play: Sven opens his front door and a woman outside says "May I come in? I'm yust in town and I want to tell your father's last words as he died from syphilis ... yah, I'm your sister; the maid is your real mother; and the bank president, see the insanity in my left eye ..." Oofta, people do jump in like that in real life. I got to page 3 of the reviews without reading anything negative about Short Cuts. I infer from this that viewers think a stage production where actors tell, but don't show, is good art. There it is. I gave it a 7 and considered an 8. Several parts were so irritating that I winced and squirmed so it's certainly effective. Two sidebars: 1. If you think Carver would be difficult to bring to the screen, see the excellent Jindabyne. 2. Altman over time became like his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Alan Rudolph - vague and insubstantial - whereas Rudolph's quirkiness grew into meatier work.

    Altman, as many have written, had a career that is pretty much evenly divided between hit and miss. While I have always enjoyed his films, to be totally honest and fair, not all of his work qualifies to the magnificent high standard of being Altmanesque. Altman loved jazz, and the best of his best work move like a brilliant jazz performance. To move along with his groove, to truly become part of the experience requires a certain presence of mind. Like the greatest jazz artists, there are those who enter into deep debates over which work is best: is Kind Of Blue better than Bitches Brew? More important? In the end, it does come down to taste and preference, and this would be my second favorite Altman film after the sheer perfection of Nashville. The films are like watching someone make a quilt, "bit by bit, putting it together" (as Sondheim said), with no one particular thread being more important than another, just a simple, glorious collection of threads pulling together to form one majestic piece. The perception that his films are "scattered" or "confusing" or "dull" because of that missing story line is, sadly, understandable: we are being fed a constant stream of Single Story at every turn, being easier to market and exploit. Altman, at his best, had no need of a single narrative line and on those occasions in which there is no semblance whatsoever of a single story arc AND he is moving at his best, he creates films quite unlike any other by any one. Both this and Nashville are invitations, seductive in their own way: there is no fourth wall in these works, while we watch them, it is as if they are watching us.

    By the time Robert Altman directed Short Cuts, in 1993, his style of interconnected and quirky characters in the format of a large cast was becoming trendy. The nineties would see other famous examples of this approach by big name directors, notably Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994 and Paul Thomas Anderson's' Magnolia from 1999. There was even a Simpson's episode in this vein in 1996 called '22 Short Films About Springfield'. Even though Altman was one of the inventors of this style, or grouping of styles, Short Takes suffers some from being in the age of such movies, rather than a monumental predecessor. Altman came close to perfecting the large, interconnected ensemble film in 1975 with Nashville. This film was more of a portrait of a unique city with its own music and culture and a portrait of the times rather than a character study or a gripping pot boiler. So the title made sense. Perhaps an even more accurate title would have been Nashville 1975. Altman excited audiences by making a large scale portrait of a time and place, full of complexity and brimming with interesting little stories and people. By 1993, the charms of these new developments were starting to wear off, and the nineties would sap the creative reservoir (and audience patience) of such sprawling films. Nashville is a better film---it cracks with energy and humor, it radiates a cynicism that was new in the 70's but is now commonplace. Short cuts fails to be a larger portrait as Nashville was. Nashville's true main character was the city herself. All the pieces fit to make a larger structure. This large structure may have been gaudy and odd, but it was worth building. Short Takes takes place in L.A. Suburbs, but is not about them. It feels like it takes place there because it was convenient, not because Altman had developed a Nashville-like interest in the area. The stories are thus highly reliant on their connections, though these can feel contrived. There is too much material here, even for 3 hours, to mine much real depth with individuals, and so the shattered pieces of a whole are hurt by never fitting into a larger structure. Nashville was 'weird' because it was about a city, Short Takes is 'weird' because it is about nothing. It seems appropriate that this movie came from the age of Seinfeld. Nashville was better and more innovative, but Short Takes was still on the front edge of the nineties trend of piecemeal interconnection dramas. It seems unfair that Pulp Fiction is so much more heralded and Magnolia is more remembered and loved. Why? Pulp Fiction might be more silly fun, and Magnolia might be by arguably the most gifted director of the three, but Short takes feels left behind by these films even though it was first, from a historical point of view. Part of this comes from the tone. The film is not touching or dramatic in the conventional sense. The viewer doesn't care about anyone in particular. We feel as upset for the girl killed by Chris Penn's character (she has only a few lines) as we do for anyone. Through its sheer fun Pulp Fiction makes you care about the characters in at least a passing way. Magnolia is a web of quirky, interconnected characters, but has more thematic and emotional focus. Short Cuts feels insincere at times, dramatically, and falls into clich&eacute;s which are amplified by the lack of time any one line of a character is given. The attempts at darkish humor fall flat or feel confusing as to whether they are serious or tongue in cheek. Despite a huge cast of huge names, the actors seem as confused and aimless as the audience. There are very good actors everywhere here and so sometimes good acting comes here and there, but there is a subdued feeling like all the talent has been handicapped. This is a good film if you are in a patient mood, but far from Altman's best work. Six stars.

    Another impressive Robert Altman ensemble piece, for the most part. Short Cuts brings us a look into the lives of an extensive number of Los Angeles residents, interconnecting in sometimes loose and sometimes more direct ways. We see doctors, singers, mothers, waitresses and plenty more, all done in the fluid and rhythmic fashion that one would expect from the man who brought us Nashville. Short Cuts feels very much like an L.A. film; there's a controlled chaos to it all that feels frenzied but in a strange way that lets you know that Altman is still behind the wheel. Over the course of the film we delve further into the lives of each individual, focusing on a few and exploring them deeper through Altman's heavy themes of morality and mortality (the film is based on a collection of short stories by Raymond Carver). It's a film that if it hits you right could get you doing a lot of self-reflecting on life and death, which is always a powerful thing to resonate within an audience. The most surprising thing about the film for me was how quickly it went by. Coming in at a running time of over 180 minutes, I was always quite intimidated by it and was expecting at least part of it to drag no matter how good the overall product was, but it flew by. Altman has this indescribable way to pace these epic ensemble pieces that make them feel so fluid and complete, keeping the focus on each character just long enough to unfold another layer but moving on to the next before it starts to drag. It's really one of the more impressive things about his capabilities as a director, how magnificently paced they are. For the majority of Short Cuts I was very impressed with everything that he was able to draw out of his cast; the emotions felt so genuine and, as he did in Nashville, the performances were mostly authentic and deeply lived-in. I don't think that it mixes the comedic and dramatic elements as well as it could have, but there was an understated quality to the dark themes that made it feel a lot more natural than if he had poured on the melodrama thick, which he easily could have given the material. Here he works with more established names than he did in something like Nashville, but there was a real lack of vanity from the actors, none of them allowing their prominence to overshadow anything else about the rest of the ensemble. Altman brings all of these characters together in a way that feels alive but not overly cinematic, expertly staged and paced...for the majority of it. There's a scene where Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine's characters get into an argument over a possible infidelity of hers, and it's around this scene that the film takes a bizarre turn for the worse. The performances that used to feel so genuine were all of a sudden desperately forced, the understated emotions that were allowed to build were now coming to the surface and were so melodramatic and shoved down the throat of the audience. It was as if Altman and the cast took everything that was working so well about it beforehand and decided to do everything in the completely opposite fashion for the final stretch. I struggle to think of a film that took such a dramatic shift, especially so late in it's game. By the time we reach the heavy-handed climax to bring together the universality of the characters, I wanted to scream at how desperate it all had become. It felt as though Altman had stepped down from his chair and let someone much less skilled than he come in and try to finish it, but they just hacked it to pieces. Short Cuts is a very good film for 150 minutes that is almost derailed by it's final 30.

    I saw this movie again last night and, like an old friend with which you had a bit of disagreement long ago but you are happy to see again, I found it most enjoyable. Well, enjoyable by an artistic, cinematic point of view. Certainly not by a human point of view since at the end, the shallowness and downright ugliness of some of the characters, came back to make me feel again that lingering subtle sense of depression at life being sometimes so unpalatable. That same bitterness at the back of your mouth after a not-so-honorable spree the night before. And yet the movie is one that you will never say: I've had enough of this. You do want to follow the different personas, their briefly brushing of self-contained lives, hoping a new story will develop, a redeeming character will appear. But no one enters from the left to shed light. Everyone is self-absorbed. I looked at the some of the other reviews to see if someone else had my same hunch and did not find any reference to what I think is Altman's inspiration for this canvas of American lives: Federico Fellini. Where La Dolce vita was a large fresco of a certain society at a certain point in time, here Altman wants to represent on a large, spread out mural a number of characters loosely connected or separated by their own materialism, hoping that, in the end, what the viewer sees is the colors and shape of a bustling city that can only be L.A. Where Fellini had a Ulysses-like character (Mastroianni) representing himself and his awe at the confusing life of a cynical old city on the verge of modern materialism, Altman does not have an himself watching and connecting the stories but tries to be more objective, more detached, letting the individual stories develop kind of casually. This is because the script does not come from him, from his own experiences ( as I understand the aging singer character is his only contribution to the plot) but from a number of short stories written by someone else. So, where Fellini is telling us of his own fears, surprises and expectations Altman is recounting someone's else story, a story that he is trying to tell not interpret, hoping that it will speak to the viewers by itself. So, if Fellini's fresco reminds me of The Triumph of Death in the cemetery of Pisa, scary, bigger than life and never to be forgotten, Altman's work reminds me of those many , beautiful murals one can see all over the world: busy, colorful, confusing and devoid of perspective but which one goes away from with a bit of bitter aftertaste for not having told a more decisive, clear message. An 8 nonetheless.

    I got to see this film for the first time this past weekend. I was interested to see how they would tie all the stories together and how smoothly it would flow. With so much going on and so many characters, I felt it did a pretty good job at it. The problem I had with it was that most of the stories were quite boring. Many of them never came to an end when the film was over. And, the ones that did, appeared to be quick fix endings to patch plot holes. It was fun to see all the actors and actresses in their prime. Many gave great performances. I just felt the writing was weak. I would like to see this film re-written and attempted again.

    I'm glad I came across this Robert Altman movie set in Los Angeles. This is a long movie and has a lot of characters. Surprisingly if you concentrate it isn't too confusing who is who. It keeps you interested to see how things turned out for the different sets of people and piecing together the jigsaw is quite fun. The story isn't that predictable. Good mix of drama and bizarre comedy, even if some of the eccentric characters are a bit too way off. Liked the fishing trip. The only problem is you don't get enough development of the characters because there isn't enough time. Maybe a few less would have been better. The best part of watching this movie in 2013 is to see the terrific cast and how they have all gone on to so much in their careers. Also a bit poignant how some of them have aged in the 20 years since. Good to see Jack Lemmon in one of his later roles. Madeleine Stowe is lovely. Tim Robbins and Peter Gallagher are quite hilarious. Worth a watch.

    I love movies that intertwine multiple stories and connect everything together with a nice big bow. However this present was far to big and ran out of wrapping paper. As the clich&eacute; goes ''more is less''. This film could have used less to make it more. I do understand the importance of character development but redundancy can leave you disinterested in one or even all the players. In fact, some of them seem disinterested with themselves and the events occurring around or directly to them. They all seem to have to much restraint when it comes to emotions. Was this the point? If so, perhaps another hour should have been added to the film to better explain why. Did I mention this film clocks in at just over 3hours? I'm usually very patient when it comes to long films, but 3hrs felt like 5 in this case. This is not a bad film, but you can get the same kind of entertainment sitting on a park bench for a few hours.

    Based on the short stories written by Raymond Carver. A vast array of different characters, all of them by some degree connected with one another, are living in the suburbs of LA. Two major events unite all of them: the helicopters spraying bug spray at the beginning of the film (setting the scene), and the earthquake that takes place at the end (ending all of the stories). Robert Altman once again doesn't fail to show his extreme exuberance and brightness in each one of the storiesnot even when dark subject matter is exposed and never fails to connect all of them with a grace and craftsmanship that very few other directors have. Structurally complex, cynical in its narrative tone and content, nearly impeccable in its execution (each one of the actors and actresses give an outstanding performance, another proof of Altman's directorial skills and talent), Short Cuts remains an American classic, not only for its larger-than-life format, but also for the influence it had on many subsequent films, such as P.T. Anderson's Magnolia and Todd Solondz's Happiness.

    ...I try to tell from inside the universe of one single human being I become speechless because I cannot decide what to say and what to conceal. But not these three men who wrote this screenplay like a symphony between Bach and Jazz - and Mark Ishams music is the same kind - divinely brilliant. A novel? Two? Three, five? Or is this all hackneyed phrases? Is there a difference at all? Three hours full of moments I found myself smiling and slightly shaking my head at the same time. Never saw such a lot of 'perfect pairs' as in "Short Cuts"! The set dressing and costume design are straight to the point. Always winking. Don't worry about little earthquakes. Never get a breakfast in a diner without sunnies. And don't lose heart because of a body in the river... Simply enjoy - inside the prison of life :-)

    Ever see someone train a dog by pushing its nose into its feces? This movie is that for 3 hours (oui, you're the dog). You watch depressed/ angry/ unpleasant characters flit and interact. There isn't one redeeming/ uplifting/ positive/ life-affirming moment. OK, wait: In the end, Waits & Tomlin celebrate their poverty and alcoholism in a dreary trailer; Robbins has sex with Stowe and brings the dog back home; MacDowell & Davison eat pastries with baker Lovett after their child dies. Yeah, sorry, all upbeat stuff. Altman was a brilliant creator (3 Women, Nashville, Mash), capturing the American panorama and subconscious like no other director. Amazing in the range of topics he undertook. But over time he relied increasingly on dialogue to move his (lack of) plot forward. For many this skim was the invisible hand of meaning - "What is he trying to say here? It's obscure so it's gravid." Short Cuts has all the Altman signatures: annoying lounge music that permeates everything, overlapping dialogue, characters staring at fish or fixed objects as they think about the meaning of life, overlapping dialogue, near-constant elevator jazz, characters who talk from the script and to the camera but not to each other, overlapping dialogue. It might be a TV show that charms via "lives of idiosyncratic, tortured, neurotic characters intersecting & intertwining in a fictional yet all-too-real city of desire, failed dreams ...." The kind of thing where folks say "OMG, that is SO my family". Except for the bit where Penn beats a girl to death with a rock; or the guy who took pictures of the girl he raped and strangled. Scenes or characters you might care or wonder about are never fully-explored; other scenes (eg. Lemmon's description of boinking his son's aunt) go on and on. And on. You got it, and still it continues. Perhaps this is a mirror that forces us to confront our inner selves while we confront our outer lives, as we reflect on .... There's some nice acting: Robbins, Stowe, Tomlin, Jason-Leigh, McDormand, Davison, Gallagher, Chris Penn, Lili Taylor, more. But almost anyone can get good performances out of these folks. Meryl Streep - sorry, I mean Julianne Moore - does her usual "watch me, I'm REALLY acting" - especially when she is nude from the waist-down in the pre-BBQ scene. Andie MacDowell, as always, squeezes her lack of range into playing herself. Same for Robert Downey Jr. and Lori Singer. Jack Lemmon does the stuttering, mumbling, rolling fingers uh-uh-uh alky-monologue thing that he (incredibly) made a career out of. His understudy Tom Waits does a gravelly-voice version of this. Boy, imagine if Altman had filmed an 8-hour version of an O'Neil play where Waits and Lemmon talk about life as they drink in a bar on a rainy day. Various characters could come and go, talking about the rain as they walk in; the bartender, perhaps a jaded Brian Blessed, would comment as he refilled their glasses .... Whew. Carver seemed to have insight, albeit through a whiskey glass, into the human spirit. But this movie version of his stories seems as contrived as a HS play. Look at the scene where Penn & Jason-Leigh consider having sex; or the photo-mixup scene; or the funeral scene where the dialogue approaches an Ibsen play: Sven opens his front door and a woman outside says "May I come in? I'm yust in town and I want to tell your father's last words as he died from syphilis ... yah, I'm your sister; the maid is your real mother; and the bank president, see the insanity in my left eye ..." Oofta, people do jump in like that in real life. I got to page 3 of the reviews without reading anything negative about Short Cuts.

I don't think that it mixes the comedic and dramatic elements as well as it could have, but there was an understated quality to the dark themes that made it feel a lot more natural than if he had poured on the melodrama thick, which he easily could have given the material. Here he works with more established names than he did in something like Nashville, but there was a real lack of vanity from the actors, none of them allowing their prominence to overshadow anything else about the rest of the ensemble. Altman brings all of these characters together in a way that feels alive but not overly cinematic, expertly staged and paced...for the majority of it. There's a scene where Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine's characters get into an argument over a possible infidelity of hers, and it's around this scene that the film takes a bizarre turn for the worse. The performances that used to feel so genuine were all of a sudden desperately forced, the understated emotions that were allowed to build were now coming to the surface and were so melodramatic and shoved down the throat of the audience. It was as if Altman and the cast took everything that was working so well about it beforehand and decided to do everything in the completely opposite fashion for the final stretch. I struggle to think of a film that took such a dramatic shift, especially so late in it's game. By the time we reach the heavy-handed climax to bring together the universality of the characters, I wanted to scream at how desperate it all had become. It felt as though Altman had stepped down from his chair and let someone much less skilled than he come in and try to finish it, but they just hacked it to pieces. Short Cuts is a very good film for 150 minutes that is almost derailed by it's final 30.

    I saw this movie again last night and, like an old friend with which you had a bit of disagreement long ago but you are happy to see again, I found it most enjoyable. Well, enjoyable by an artistic, cinematic point of view. Certainly not by a human point of view since at the end, the shallowness and downright ugliness of some of the characters, came back to make me feel again that lingering subtle sense of depression at life being sometimes so unpalatable. That same bitterness at the back of your mouth after a not-so-honorable spree the night before. And yet the movie is one that you will never say: I've had enough of this. You do want to follow the different personas, their briefly brushing of self-contained lives, hoping a new story will develop, a redeeming character will appear. But no one enters from the left to shed light. Everyone is self-absorbed. I looked at the some of the other reviews to see if someone else had my same hunch and did not find any reference to what I think is Altman's inspiration for this canvas of American lives: Federico Fellini. Where La Dolce vita was a large fresco of a certain society at a certain point in time, here Altman wants to represent on a large, spread out mural a number of characters loosely connected or separated by their own materialism, hoping that, in the end, what the viewer sees is the colors and shape of a bustling city that can only be L.A. Where Fellini had a Ulysses-like character (Mastroianni) representing himself and his awe at the confusing life of a cynical old city on the verge of modern materialism, Altman does not have an himself watching and connecting the stories but tries to be more objective, more detached, letting the individual stories develop kind of casually. This is because the script does not come from him, from his own experiences ( as I understand the aging singer character is his only contribution to the plot) but from a number of short stories written by someone else. So, where Fellini is telling us of his own fears, surprises and expectations Altman is recounting someone's else story, a story that he is trying to tell not interpret, hoping that it will speak to the viewers by itself. So, if Fellini's fresco reminds me of The Triumph of Death in the cemetery of Pisa, scary, bigger than life and never to be forgotten, Altman's work reminds me of those many , beautiful murals one can see all over the world: busy, colorful, confusing and devoid of perspective but which one goes away from with a bit of bitter aftertaste for not having told a more decisive, clear message. An 8 nonetheless.

    I got to see this film for the first time this past weekend. I was interested to see how they would tie all the stories together and how smoothly it would flow. With so much going on and so many characters, I felt it did a pretty good job at it. The problem I had with it was that most of the stories were quite boring. Many of them never came to an end when the film was over. And, the ones that did, appeared to be quick fix endings to patch plot holes. It was fun to see all the actors and actresses in their prime. Many gave great performances. I just felt the writing was weak. I would like to see this film re-written and attempted again.

    I'm glad I came across this Robert Altman movie set in Los Angeles. This is a long movie and has a lot of characters. Surprisingly if you concentrate it isn't too confusing who is who. It keeps you interested to see how things turned out for the different sets of people and piecing together the jigsaw is quite fun. The story isn't that predictable. Good mix of drama and bizarre comedy, even if some of the eccentric characters are a bit too way off. Liked the fishing trip. The only problem is you don't get enough development of the characters because there isn't enough time. Maybe a few less would have been better. The best part of watching this movie in 2013 is to see the terrific cast and how they have all gone on to so much in their careers. Also a bit poignant how some of them have aged in the 20 years since. Good to see Jack Lemmon in one of his later roles. Madeleine Stowe is lovely. Tim Robbins and Peter Gallagher are quite hilarious. Worth a watch.

    I love movies that intertwine multiple stories and connect everything together with a nice big bow. However this present was far to big and ran out of wrapping paper. As the clich&eacute; goes ''more is less''. This film could have used less to make it more. I do understand the importance of character development but redundancy can leave you disinterested in one or even all the players. In fact, some of them seem disinterested with themselves and the events occurring around or directly to them. They all seem to have to much restraint when it comes to emotions. Was this the point? If so, perhaps another hour should have been added to the film to better explain why. Did I mention this film clocks in at just over 3hours? I'm usually very patient when it comes to long films, but 3hrs felt like 5 in this case. This is not a bad film, but you can get the same kind of entertainment sitting on a park bench for a few hours.

    Based on the short stories written by Raymond Carver. A vast array of different characters, all of them by some degree connected with one another, are living in the suburbs of LA. Two major events unite all of them: the helicopters spraying bug spray at the beginning of the film (setting the scene), and the earthquake that takes place at the end (ending all of the stories). Robert Altman once again doesn't fail to show his extreme exuberance and brightness in each one of the storiesnot even when dark subject matter is exposed and never fails to connect all of them with a grace and craftsmanship that very few other directors have. Structurally complex, cynical in its narrative tone and content, nearly impeccable in its execution (each one of the actors and actresses give an outstanding performance, another proof of Altman's directorial skills and talent), Short Cuts remains an American classic, not only for its larger-than-life format, but also for the influence it had on many subsequent films, such as P.T. Anderson's Magnolia and Todd Solondz's Happiness.

    ...I try to tell from inside the universe of one single human being I become speechless because I cannot decide what to say and what to conceal. But not these three men who wrote this screenplay like a symphony between Bach and Jazz - and Mark Ishams music is the same kind - divinely brilliant. A novel? Two? Three, five? Or is this all hackneyed phrases? Is there a difference at all? Three hours full of moments I found myself smiling and slightly shaking my head at the same time. Never saw such a lot of 'perfect pairs' as in "Short Cuts"! The set dressing and costume design are straight to the point. Always winking. Don't worry about little earthquakes. Never get a breakfast in a diner without sunnies. And don't lose heart because of a body in the river... Simply enjoy - inside the prison of life :-)

    Ever see someone train a dog by pushing its nose into its feces? This movie is that for 3 hours (oui, you're the dog). You watch depressed/ angry/ unpleasant characters flit and interact. There isn't one redeeming/ uplifting/ positive/ life-affirming moment. OK, wait: In the end, Waits & Tomlin celebrate their poverty and alcoholism in a dreary trailer; Robbins has sex with Stowe and brings the dog back home; MacDowell & Davison eat pastries with baker Lovett after their child dies. Yeah, sorry, all upbeat stuff. Altman was a brilliant creator (3 Women, Nashville, Mash), capturing the American panorama and subconscious like no other director. Amazing in the range of topics he undertook. But over time he relied increasingly on dialogue to move his (lack of) plot forward. For many this skim was the invisible hand of meaning - "What is he trying to say here? It's obscure so it's gravid." Short Cuts has all the Altman signatures: annoying lounge music that permeates everything, overlapping dialogue, characters staring at fish or fixed objects as they think about the meaning of life, overlapping dialogue, near-constant elevator jazz, characters who talk from the script and to the camera but not to each other, overlapping dialogue. It might be a TV show that charms via "lives of idiosyncratic, tortured, neurotic characters intersecting & intertwining in a fictional yet all-too-real city of desire, failed dreams ...." The kind of thing where folks say "OMG, that is SO my family". Except for the bit where Penn beats a girl to death with a rock; or the guy who took pictures of the girl he raped and strangled. Scenes or characters you might care or wonder about are never fully-explored; other scenes (eg. Lemmon's description of boinking his son's aunt) go on and on. And on. You got it, and still it continues. Perhaps this is a mirror that forces us to confront our inner selves while we confront our outer lives, as we reflect on .... There's some nice acting: Robbins, Stowe, Tomlin, Jason-Leigh, McDormand, Davison, Gallagher, Chris Penn, Lili Taylor, more. But almost anyone can get good performances out of these folks. Meryl Streep - sorry, I mean Julianne Moore - does her usual "watch me, I'm REALLY acting" - especially when she is nude from the waist-down in the pre-BBQ scene. Andie MacDowell, as always, squeezes her lack of range into playing herself. Same for Robert Downey Jr. and Lori Singer. Jack Lemmon does the stuttering, mumbling, rolling fingers uh-uh-uh alky-monologue thing that he (incredibly) made a career out of. His understudy Tom Waits does a gravelly-voice version of this. Boy, imagine if Altman had filmed an 8-hour version of an O'Neil play where Waits and Lemmon talk about life as they drink in a bar on a rainy day. Various characters could come and go, talking about the rain as they walk in; the bartender, perhaps a jaded Brian Blessed, would comment as he refilled their glasses .... Whew. Carver seemed to have insight, albeit through a whiskey glass, into the human spirit. But this movie version of his stories seems as contrived as a HS play. Look at the scene where Penn & Jason-Leigh consider having sex; or the photo-mixup scene; or the funeral scene where the dialogue approaches an Ibsen play: Sven opens his front door and a woman outside says "May I come in? I'm yust in town and I want to tell your father's last words as he died from syphilis ... yah, I'm your sister; the maid is your real mother; and the bank president, see the insanity in my left eye ..." Oofta, people do jump in like that in real life. I got to page 3 of the reviews without reading anything negative about Short Cuts. I infer from this that viewers think a stage production where actors tell, but don't show, is good art. There it is. I gave it a 7 and considered an 8. Several parts were so irritating that I winced and squirmed so it's certainly effective. Two sidebars: 1. If you think Carver would be difficult to bring to the screen, see the excellent Jindabyne. 2. Altman over time became like his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Alan Rudolph - vague and insubstantial - whereas Rudolph's quirkiness grew into meatier work.

    Altman, as many have written, had a career that is pretty much evenly divided between hit and miss. While I have always enjoyed his films, to be totally honest and fair, not all of his work qualifies to the magnificent high standard of being Altmanesque. Altman loved jazz, and the best of his best work move like a brilliant jazz performance. To move along with his groove, to truly become part of the experience requires a certain presence of mind. Like the greatest jazz artists, there are those who enter into deep debates over which work is best: is Kind Of Blue better than Bitches Brew? More important? In the end, it does come down to taste and preference, and this would be my second favorite Altman film after the sheer perfection of Nashville. The films are like watching someone make a quilt, "bit by bit, putting it together" (as Sondheim said), with no one particular thread being more important than another, just a simple, glorious collection of threads pulling together to form one majestic piece. The perception that his films are "scattered" or "confusing" or "dull" because of that missing story line is, sadly, understandable: we are being fed a constant stream of Single Story at every turn, being easier to market and exploit. Altman, at his best, had no need of a single narrative line and on those occasions in which there is no semblance whatsoever of a single story arc AND he is moving at his best, he creates films quite unlike any other by any one. Both this and Nashville are invitations, seductive in their own way: there is no fourth wall in these works, while we watch them, it is as if they are watching us.

    By the time Robert Altman directed Short Cuts, in 1993, his style of interconnected and quirky characters in the format of a large cast was becoming trendy. The nineties would see other famous examples of this approach by big name directors, notably Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994 and Paul Thomas Anderson's' Magnolia from 1999. There was even a Simpson's episode in this vein in 1996 called '22 Short Films About Springfield'. Even though Altman was one of the inventors of this style, or grouping of styles, Short Takes suffers some from being in the age of such movies, rather than a monumental predecessor. Altman came close to perfecting the large, interconnected ensemble film in 1975 with Nashville. This film was more of a portrait of a unique city with its own music and culture and a portrait of the times rather than a character study or a gripping pot boiler. So the title made sense. Perhaps an even more accurate title would have been Nashville 1975. Altman excited audiences by making a large scale portrait of a time and place, full of complexity and brimming with interesting little stories and people. By 1993, the charms of these new developments were starting to wear off, and the nineties would sap the creative reservoir (and audience patience) of such sprawling films. Nashville is a better film---it cracks with energy and humor, it radiates a cynicism that was new in the 70's but is now commonplace. Short cuts fails to be a larger portrait as Nashville was. Nashville's true main character was the city herself. All the pieces fit to make a larger structure. This large structure may have been gaudy and odd, but it was worth building. Short Takes takes place in L.A. Suburbs, but is not about them. It feels like it takes place there because it was convenient, not because Altman had developed a Nashville-like interest in the area. The stories are thus highly reliant on their connections, though these can feel contrived. There is too much material here, even for 3 hours, to mine much real depth with individuals, and so the shattered pieces of a whole are hurt by never fitting into a larger structure. Nashville was 'weird' because it was about a city, Short Takes is 'weird' because it is about nothing. It seems appropriate that this movie came from the age of Seinfeld. Nashville was better and more innovative, but Short Takes was still on the front edge of the nineties trend of piecemeal interconnection dramas. It seems unfair that Pulp Fiction is so much more heralded and Magnolia is more remembered and loved. Why? Pulp Fiction might be more silly fun, and Magnolia might be by arguably the most gifted director of the three, but Short takes feels left behind by these films even though it was first, from a historical point of view. Part of this comes from the tone. The film is not touching or dramatic in the conventional sense. The viewer doesn't care about anyone in particular. We feel as upset for the girl killed by Chris Penn's character (she has only a few lines) as we do for anyone. Through its sheer fun Pulp Fiction makes you care about the characters in at least a passing way. Magnolia is a web of quirky, interconnected characters, but has more thematic and emotional focus. Short Cuts feels insincere at times, dramatically, and falls into clich&eacute;s which are amplified by the lack of time any one line of a character is given. The attempts at darkish humor fall flat or feel confusing as to whether they are serious or tongue in cheek. Despite a huge cast of huge names, the actors seem as confused and aimless as the audience. There are very good actors everywhere here and so sometimes good acting comes here and there, but there is a subdued feeling like all the talent has been handicapped. This is a good film if you are in a patient mood, but far from Altman's best work. Six stars.

    Another impressive Robert Altman ensemble piece, for the most part. Short Cuts brings us a look into the lives of an extensive number of Los Angeles residents, interconnecting in sometimes loose and sometimes more direct ways. We see doctors, singers, mothers, waitresses and plenty more, all done in the fluid and rhythmic fashion that one would expect from the man who brought us Nashville. Short Cuts feels very much like an L.A. film; there's a controlled chaos to it all that feels frenzied but in a strange way that lets you know that Altman is still behind the wheel. Over the course of the film we delve further into the lives of each individual, focusing on a few and exploring them deeper through Altman's heavy themes of morality and mortality (the film is based on a collection of short stories by Raymond Carver). It's a film that if it hits you right could get you doing a lot of self-reflecting on life and death, which is always a powerful thing to resonate within an audience. The most surprising thing about the film for me was how quickly it went by. Coming in at a running time of over 180 minutes, I was always quite intimidated by it and was expecting at least part of it to drag no matter how good the overall product was, but it flew by. Altman has this indescribable way to pace these epic ensemble pieces that make them feel so fluid and complete, keeping the focus on each character just long enough to unfold another layer but moving on to the next before it starts to drag. It's really one of the more impressive things about his capabilities as a director, how magnificently paced they are. For the majority of Short Cuts I was very impressed with everything that he was able to draw out of his cast; the emotions felt so genuine and, as he did in Nashville, the performances were mostly authentic and deeply lived-in. I don't think that it mixes the comedic and dramatic elements as well as it could have, but there was an understated quality to the dark themes that made it feel a lot more natural than if he had poured on the melodrama thick, which he easily could have given the material. Here he works with more established names than he did in something like Nashville, but there was a real lack of vanity from the actors, none of them allowing their prominence to overshadow anything else about the rest of the ensemble. Altman brings all of these characters together in a way that feels alive but not overly cinematic, expertly staged and paced...for the majority of it. There's a scene where Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine's characters get into an argument over a possible infidelity of hers, and it's around this scene that the film takes a bizarre turn for the worse. The performances that used to feel so genuine were all of a sudden desperately forced, the understated emotions that were allowed to build were now coming to the surface and were so melodramatic and shoved down the throat of the audience. It was as if Altman and the cast took everything that was working so well about it beforehand and decided to do everything in the completely opposite fashion for the final stretch. I struggle to think of a film that took such a dramatic shift, especially so late in it's game. By the time we reach the heavy-handed climax to bring together the universality of the characters, I wanted to scream at how desperate it all had become. It felt as though Altman had stepped down from his chair and let someone much less skilled than he come in and try to finish it, but they just hacked it to pieces. Short Cuts is a very good film for 150 minutes that is almost derailed by it's final 30.

    ...I try to tell from inside the universe of one single human being I become speechless because I cannot decide what to say and what to conceal. But not these three men who wrote this screenplay like a symphony between Bach and Jazz - and Mark Ishams music is the same kind - divinely brilliant. A novel? Two? Three, five? Or is this all hackneyed phrases? Is there a difference at all? Three hours full of moments I found myself smiling and slightly shaking my head at the same time. Never saw such a lot of 'perfect pairs' as in "Short Cuts"! The set dressing and costume design are straight to the point. Always winking. Don't worry about little earthquakes. Never get a breakfast in a diner without sunnies. And don't lose heart because of a body in the river... Simply enjoy - inside the prison of life :-)

    Ever see someone train a dog by pushing its nose into its feces? This movie is that for 3 hours (oui, you're the dog). You watch depressed/ angry/ unpleasant characters flit and interact. There isn't one redeeming/ uplifting/ positive/ life-affirming moment. OK, wait: In the end, Waits & Tomlin celebrate their poverty and alcoholism in a dreary trailer; Robbins has sex with Stowe and brings the dog back home; MacDowell & Davison eat pastries with baker Lovett after their child dies. Yeah, sorry, all upbeat stuff. Altman was a brilliant creator (3 Women, Nashville, Mash), capturing the American panorama and subconscious like no other director. Amazing in the range of topics he undertook. But over time he relied increasingly on dialogue to move his (lack of) plot forward. For many this skim was the invisible hand of meaning - "What is he trying to say here? It's obscure so it's gravid." Short Cuts has all the Altman signatures: annoying lounge music that permeates everything, overlapping dialogue, characters staring at fish or fixed objects as they think about the meaning of life, overlapping dialogue, near-constant elevator jazz, characters who talk from the script and to the camera but not to each other, overlapping dialogue. It might be a TV show that charms via "lives of idiosyncratic, tortured, neurotic characters intersecting & intertwining in a fictional yet all-too-real city of desire, failed dreams ...." The kind of thing where folks say "OMG, that is SO my family". Except for the bit where Penn beats a girl to death with a rock; or the guy who took pictures of the girl he raped and strangled. Scenes or characters you might care or wonder about are never fully-explored; other scenes (eg. Lemmon's description of boinking his son's aunt) go on and on. And on. You got it, and still it continues. Perhaps this is a mirror that forces us to confront our inner selves while we confront our outer lives, as we reflect on .... There's some nice acting: Robbins, Stowe, Tomlin, Jason-Leigh, McDormand, Davison, Gallagher, Chris Penn, Lili Taylor, more. But almost anyone can get good performances out of these folks. Meryl Streep - sorry, I mean Julianne Moore - does her usual "watch me, I'm REALLY acting" - especially when she is nude from the waist-down in the pre-BBQ scene. Andie MacDowell, as always, squeezes her lack of range into playing herself. Same for Robert Downey Jr. and Lori Singer. Jack Lemmon does the stuttering, mumbling, rolling fingers uh-uh-uh alky-monologue thing that he (incredibly) made a career out of. His understudy Tom Waits does a gravelly-voice version of this. Boy, imagine if Altman had filmed an 8-hour version of an O'Neil play where Waits and Lemmon talk about life as they drink in a bar on a rainy day. Various characters could come and go, talking about the rain as they walk in; the bartender, perhaps a jaded Brian Blessed, would comment as he refilled their glasses .... Whew. Carver seemed to have insight, albeit through a whiskey glass, into the human spirit. But this movie version of his stories seems as contrived as a HS play. Look at the scene where Penn & Jason-Leigh consider having sex; or the photo-mixup scene; or the funeral scene where the dialogue approaches an Ibsen play: Sven opens his front door and a woman outside says "May I come in? I'm yust in town and I want to tell your father's last words as he died from syphilis ... yah, I'm your sister; the maid is your real mother; and the bank president, see the insanity in my left eye ..." Oofta, people do jump in like that in real life. I got to page 3 of the reviews without reading anything negative about Short Cuts. I infer from this that viewers think a stage production where actors tell, but don't show, is good art. There it is. I gave it a 7 and considered an 8. Several parts were so irritating that I winced and squirmed so it's certainly effective. Two sidebars: 1. If you think Carver would be difficult to bring to the screen, see the excellent Jindabyne. 2. Altman over time became like his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Alan Rudolph - vague and insubstantial - whereas Rudolph's quirkiness grew into meatier work.

    Altman, as many have written, had a career that is pretty much evenly divided between hit and miss. While I have always enjoyed his films, to be totally honest and fair, not all of his work qualifies to the magnificent high standard of being Altmanesque. Altman loved jazz, and the best of his best work move like a brilliant jazz performance. To move along with his groove, to truly become part of the experience requires a certain presence of mind. Like the greatest jazz artists, there are those who enter into deep debates over which work is best: is Kind Of Blue better than Bitches Brew? More important? In the end, it does come down to taste and preference, and this would be my second favorite Altman film after the sheer perfection of Nashville. The films are like watching someone make a quilt, "bit by bit, putting it together" (as Sondheim said), with no one particular thread being more important than another, just a simple, glorious collection of threads pulling together to form one majestic piece. The perception that his films are "scattered" or "confusing" or "dull" because of that missing story line is, sadly, understandable: we are being fed a constant stream of Single Story at every turn, being easier to market and exploit. Altman, at his best, had no need of a single narrative line and on those occasions in which there is no semblance whatsoever of a single story arc AND he is moving at his best, he creates films quite unlike any other by any one. Both this and Nashville are invitations, seductive in their own way: there is no fourth wall in these works, while we watch them, it is as if they are watching us.

    By the time Robert Altman directed Short Cuts, in 1993, his style of interconnected and quirky characters in the format of a large cast was becoming trendy. The nineties would see other famous examples of this approach by big name directors, notably Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994 and Paul Thomas Anderson's' Magnolia from 1999. There was even a Simpson's episode in this vein in 1996 called '22 Short Films About Springfield'. Even though Altman was one of the inventors of this style, or grouping of styles, Short Takes suffers some from being in the age of such movies, rather than a monumental predecessor. Altman came close to perfecting the large, interconnected ensemble film in 1975 with Nashville. This film was more of a portrait of a unique city with its own music and culture and a portrait of the times rather than a character study or a gripping pot boiler. So the title made sense. Perhaps an even more accurate title would have been Nashville 1975. Altman excited audiences by making a large scale portrait of a time and place, full of complexity and brimming with interesting little stories and people. By 1993, the charms of these new developments were starting to wear off, and the nineties would sap the creative reservoir (and audience patience) of such sprawling films. Nashville is a better film---it cracks with energy and humor, it radiates a cynicism that was new in the 70's but is now commonplace. Short cuts fails to be a larger portrait as Nashville was. Nashville's true main character was the city herself. All the pieces fit to make a larger structure. This large structure may have been gaudy and odd, but it was worth building. Short Takes takes place in L.A. Suburbs, but is not about them. It feels like it takes place there because it was convenient, not because Altman had developed a Nashville-like interest in the area. The stories are thus highly reliant on their connections, though these can feel contrived. There is too much material here, even for 3 hours, to mine much real depth with individuals, and so the shattered pieces of a whole are hurt by never fitting into a larger structure. Nashville was 'weird' because it was about a city, Short Takes is 'weird' because it is about nothing. It seems appropriate that this movie came from the age of Seinfeld. Nashville was better and more innovative, but Short Takes was still on the front edge of the nineties trend of piecemeal interconnection dramas. It seems unfair that Pulp Fiction is so much more heralded and Magnolia is more remembered and loved. Why? Pulp Fiction might be more silly fun, and Magnolia might be by arguably the most gifted director of the three, but Short takes feels left behind by these films even though it was first, from a historical point of view. Part of this comes from the tone. The film is not touching or dramatic in the conventional sense. The viewer doesn't care about anyone in particular. We feel as upset for the girl killed by Chris Penn's character (she has only a few lines) as we do for anyone. Through its sheer fun Pulp Fiction makes you care about the characters in at least a passing way. Magnolia is a web of quirky, interconnected characters, but has more thematic and emotional focus. Short Cuts feels insincere at times, dramatically, and falls into clich&eacute;s which are amplified by the lack of time any one line of a character is given. The attempts at darkish humor fall flat or feel confusing as to whether they are serious or tongue in cheek. Despite a huge cast of huge names, the actors seem as confused and aimless as the audience. There are very good actors everywhere here and so sometimes good acting comes here and there, but there is a subdued feeling like all the talent has been handicapped. This is a good film if you are in a patient mood, but far from Altman's best work. Six stars.

    Another impressive Robert Altman ensemble piece, for the most part. Short Cuts brings us a look into the lives of an extensive number of Los Angeles residents, interconnecting in sometimes loose and sometimes more direct ways. We see doctors, singers, mothers, waitresses and plenty more, all done in the fluid and rhythmic fashion that one would expect from the man who brought us Nashville. Short Cuts feels very much like an L.A. film; there's a controlled chaos to it all that feels frenzied but in a strange way that lets you know that Altman is still behind the wheel. Over the course of the film we delve further into the lives of each individual, focusing on a few and exploring them deeper through Altman's heavy themes of morality and mortality (the film is based on a collection of short stories by Raymond Carver). It's a film that if it hits you right could get you doing a lot of self-reflecting on life and death, which is always a powerful thing to resonate within an audience. The most surprising thing about the film for me was how quickly it went by. Coming in at a running time of over 180 minutes, I was always quite intimidated by it and was expecting at least part of it to drag no matter how good the overall product was, but it flew by. Altman has this indescribable way to pace these epic ensemble pieces that make them feel so fluid and complete, keeping the focus on each character just long enough to unfold another layer but moving on to the next before it starts to drag. It's really one of the more impressive things about his capabilities as a director, how magnificently paced they are. For the majority of Short Cuts I was very impressed with everything that he was able to draw out of his cast; the emotions felt so genuine and, as he did in Nashville, the performances were mostly authentic and deeply lived-in. I don't think that it mixes the comedic and dramatic elements as well as it could have, but there was an understated quality to the dark themes that made it feel a lot more natural than if he had poured on the melodrama thick, which he easily could have given the material. Here he works with more established names than he did in something like Nashville, but there was a real lack of vanity from the actors, none of them allowing their prominence to overshadow anything else about the rest of the ensemble. Altman brings all of these characters together in a way that feels alive but not overly cinematic, expertly staged and paced...for the majority of it. There's a scene where Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine's characters get into an argument over a possible infidelity of hers, and it's around this scene that the film takes a bizarre turn for the worse. The performances that used to feel so genuine were all of a sudden desperately forced, the understated emotions that were allowed to build were now coming to the surface and were so melodramatic and shoved down the throat of the audience. It was as if Altman and the cast took everything that was working so well about it beforehand and decided to do everything in the completely opposite fashion for the final stretch. I struggle to think of a film that took such a dramatic shift, especially so late in it's game. By the time we reach the heavy-handed climax to bring together the universality of the characters, I wanted to scream at how desperate it all had become. It felt as though Altman had stepped down from his chair and let someone much less skilled than he come in and try to finish it, but they just hacked it to pieces. Short Cuts is a very good film for 150 minutes that is almost derailed by it's final 30.

    I saw this movie again last night and, like an old friend with which you had a bit of disagreement long ago but you are happy to see again, I found it most enjoyable. Well, enjoyable by an artistic, cinematic point of view. Certainly not by a human point of view since at the end, the shallowness and downright ugliness of some of the characters, came back to make me feel again that lingering subtle sense of depression at life being sometimes so unpalatable. That same bitterness at the back of your mouth after a not-so-honorable spree the night before. And yet the movie is one that you will never say: I've had enough of this. You do want to follow the different personas, their briefly brushing of self-contained lives, hoping a new story will develop, a redeeming character will appear. But no one enters from the left to shed light. Everyone is self-absorbed. I looked at the some of the other reviews to see if someone else had my same hunch and did not find any reference to what I think is Altman's inspiration for this canvas of American lives: Federico Fellini. Where La Dolce vita was a large fresco of a certain society at a certain point in time, here Altman wants to represent on a large, spread out mural a number of characters loosely connected or separated by their own materialism, hoping that, in the end, what the viewer sees is the colors and shape of a bustling city that can only be L.A. Where Fellini had a Ulysses-like character (Mastroianni) representing himself and his awe at the confusing life of a cynical old city on the verge of modern materialism, Altman does not have an himself watching and connecting the stories but tries to be more objective, more detached, letting the individual stories develop kind of casually. This is because the script does not come from him, from his own experiences ( as I understand the aging singer character is his only contribution to the plot) but from a number of short stories written by someone else. So, where Fellini is telling us of his own fears, surprises and expectations Altman is recounting someone's else story, a story that he is trying to tell not interpret, hoping that it will speak to the viewers by itself. So, if Fellini's fresco reminds me of The Triumph of Death in the cemetery of Pisa, scary, bigger than life and never to be forgotten, Altman's work reminds me of those many , beautiful murals one can see all over the world: busy, colorful, confusing and devoid of perspective but which one goes away from with a bit of bitter aftertaste for not having told a more decisive, clear message. An 8 nonetheless.

    I got to see this film for the first time this past weekend. I was interested to see how they would tie all the stories together and how smoothly it would flow. With so much going on and so many characters, I felt it did a pretty good job at it. The problem I had with it was that most of the stories were quite boring. Many of them never came to an end when the film was over. And, the ones that did, appeared to be quick fix endings to patch plot holes. It was fun to see all the actors and actresses in their prime. Many gave great performances. I just felt the writing was weak. I would like to see this film re-written and attempted again.

    I'm glad I came across this Robert Altman movie set in Los Angeles. This is a long movie and has a lot of characters. Surprisingly if you concentrate it isn't too confusing who is who. It keeps you interested to see how things turned out for the different sets of people and piecing together the jigsaw is quite fun. The story isn't that predictable. Good mix of drama and bizarre comedy, even if some of the eccentric characters are a bit too way off. Liked the fishing trip. The only problem is you don't get enough development of the characters because there isn't enough time. Maybe a few less would have been better. The best part of watching this movie in 2013 is to see the terrific cast and how they have all gone on to so much in their careers. Also a bit poignant how some of them have aged in the 20 years since. Good to see Jack Lemmon in one of his later roles. Madeleine Stowe is lovely. Tim Robbins and Peter Gallagher are quite hilarious. Worth a watch.

    I love movies that intertwine multiple stories and connect everything together with a nice big bow. However this present was far to big and ran out of wrapping paper. As the clich&eacute; goes ''more is less''. This film could have used less to make it more. I do understand the importance of character development but redundancy can leave you disinterested in one or even all the players. In fact, some of them seem disinterested with themselves and the events occurring around or directly to them. They all seem to have to much restraint when it comes to emotions. Was this the point? If so, perhaps another hour should have been added to the film to better explain why. Did I mention this film clocks in at just over 3hours? I'm usually very patient when it comes to long films, but 3hrs felt like 5 in this case. This is not a bad film, but you can get the same kind of entertainment sitting on a park bench for a few hours.

    Based on the short stories written by Raymond Carver. A vast array of different characters, all of them by some degree connected with one another, are living in the suburbs of LA. Two major events unite all of them: the helicopters spraying bug spray at the beginning of the film (setting the scene), and the earthquake that takes place at the end (ending all of the stories). Robert Altman once again doesn't fail to show his extreme exuberance and brightness in each one of the storiesnot even when dark subject matter is exposed and never fails to connect all of them with a grace and craftsmanship that very few other directors have. Structurally complex, cynical in its narrative tone and content, nearly impeccable in its execution (each one of the actors and actresses give an outstanding performance, another proof of Altman's directorial skills and talent), Short Cuts remains an American classic, not only for its larger-than-life format, but also for the influence it had on many subsequent films, such as P.T. Anderson's Magnolia and Todd Solondz's Happiness.

Pulp Fiction might be more silly fun, and Magnolia might be by arguably the most gifted director of the three, but Short takes feels left behind by these films even though it was first, from a historical point of view. Part of this comes from the tone. The film is not touching or dramatic in the conventional sense. The viewer doesn't care about anyone in particular. We feel as upset for the girl killed by Chris Penn's character (she has only a few lines) as we do for anyone. Through its sheer fun Pulp Fiction makes you care about the characters in at least a passing way. Magnolia is a web of quirky, interconnected characters, but has more thematic and emotional focus. Short Cuts feels insincere at times, dramatically, and falls into clich&eacute;s which are amplified by the lack of time any one line of a character is given. The attempts at darkish humor fall flat or feel confusing as to whether they are serious or tongue in cheek. Despite a huge cast of huge names, the actors seem as confused and aimless as the audience. There are very good actors everywhere here and so sometimes good acting comes here and there, but there is a subdued feeling like all the talent has been handicapped. This is a good film if you are in a patient mood, but far from Altman's best work. Six stars.

    Another impressive Robert Altman ensemble piece, for the most part. Short Cuts brings us a look into the lives of an extensive number of Los Angeles residents, interconnecting in sometimes loose and sometimes more direct ways. We see doctors, singers, mothers, waitresses and plenty more, all done in the fluid and rhythmic fashion that one would expect from the man who brought us Nashville. Short Cuts feels very much like an L.A. film; there's a controlled chaos to it all that feels frenzied but in a strange way that lets you know that Altman is still behind the wheel. Over the course of the film we delve further into the lives of each individual, focusing on a few and exploring them deeper through Altman's heavy themes of morality and mortality (the film is based on a collection of short stories by Raymond Carver). It's a film that if it hits you right could get you doing a lot of self-reflecting on life and death, which is always a powerful thing to resonate within an audience. The most surprising thing about the film for me was how quickly it went by. Coming in at a running time of over 180 minutes, I was always quite intimidated by it and was expecting at least part of it to drag no matter how good the overall product was, but it flew by. Altman has this indescribable way to pace these epic ensemble pieces that make them feel so fluid and complete, keeping the focus on each character just long enough to unfold another layer but moving on to the next before it starts to drag. It's really one of the more impressive things about his capabilities as a director, how magnificently paced they are. For the majority of Short Cuts I was very impressed with everything that he was able to draw out of his cast; the emotions felt so genuine and, as he did in Nashville, the performances were mostly authentic and deeply lived-in. I don't think that it mixes the comedic and dramatic elements as well as it could have, but there was an understated quality to the dark themes that made it feel a lot more natural than if he had poured on the melodrama thick, which he easily could have given the material. Here he works with more established names than he did in something like Nashville, but there was a real lack of vanity from the actors, none of them allowing their prominence to overshadow anything else about the rest of the ensemble. Altman brings all of these characters together in a way that feels alive but not overly cinematic, expertly staged and paced...for the majority of it. There's a scene where Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine's characters get into an argument over a possible infidelity of hers, and it's around this scene that the film takes a bizarre turn for the worse. The performances that used to feel so genuine were all of a sudden desperately forced, the understated emotions that were allowed to build were now coming to the surface and were so melodramatic and shoved down the throat of the audience. It was as if Altman and the cast took everything that was working so well about it beforehand and decided to do everything in the completely opposite fashion for the final stretch. I struggle to think of a film that took such a dramatic shift, especially so late in it's game. By the time we reach the heavy-handed climax to bring together the universality of the characters, I wanted to scream at how desperate it all had become. It felt as though Altman had stepped down from his chair and let someone much less skilled than he come in and try to finish it, but they just hacked it to pieces. Short Cuts is a very good film for 150 minutes that is almost derailed by it's final 30.

    I saw this movie again last night and, like an old friend with which you had a bit of disagreement long ago but you are happy to see again, I found it most enjoyable. Well, enjoyable by an artistic, cinematic point of view. Certainly not by a human point of view since at the end, the shallowness and downright ugliness of some of the characters, came back to make me feel again that lingering subtle sense of depression at life being sometimes so unpalatable. That same bitterness at the back of your mouth after a not-so-honorable spree the night before. And yet the movie is one that you will never say: I've had enough of this. You do want to follow the different personas, their briefly brushing of self-contained lives, hoping a new story will develop, a redeeming character will appear. But no one enters from the left to shed light. Everyone is self-absorbed. I looked at the some of the other reviews to see if someone else had my same hunch and did not find any reference to what I think is Altman's inspiration for this canvas of American lives: Federico Fellini. Where La Dolce vita was a large fresco of a certain society at a certain point in time, here Altman wants to represent on a large, spread out mural a number of characters loosely connected or separated by their own materialism, hoping that, in the end, what the viewer sees is the colors and shape of a bustling city that can only be L.A. Where Fellini had a Ulysses-like character (Mastroianni) representing himself and his awe at the confusing life of a cynical old city on the verge of modern materialism, Altman does not have an himself watching and connecting the stories but tries to be more objective, more detached, letting the individual stories develop kind of casually. This is because the script does not come from him, from his own experiences ( as I understand the aging singer character is his only contribution to the plot) but from a number of short stories written by someone else. So, where Fellini is telling us of his own fears, surprises and expectations Altman is recounting someone's else story, a story that he is trying to tell not interpret, hoping that it will speak to the viewers by itself. So, if Fellini's fresco reminds me of The Triumph of Death in the cemetery of Pisa, scary, bigger than life and never to be forgotten, Altman's work reminds me of those many , beautiful murals one can see all over the world: busy, colorful, confusing and devoid of perspective but which one goes away from with a bit of bitter aftertaste for not having told a more decisive, clear message. An 8 nonetheless.

    I got to see this film for the first time this past weekend. I was interested to see how they would tie all the stories together and how smoothly it would flow. With so much going on and so many characters, I felt it did a pretty good job at it. The problem I had with it was that most of the stories were quite boring. Many of them never came to an end when the film was over. And, the ones that did, appeared to be quick fix endings to patch plot holes. It was fun to see all the actors and actresses in their prime. Many gave great performances. I just felt the writing was weak. I would like to see this film re-written and attempted again.

    I'm glad I came across this Robert Altman movie set in Los Angeles. This is a long movie and has a lot of characters. Surprisingly if you concentrate it isn't too confusing who is who. It keeps you interested to see how things turned out for the different sets of people and piecing together the jigsaw is quite fun. The story isn't that predictable. Good mix of drama and bizarre comedy, even if some of the eccentric characters are a bit too way off. Liked the fishing trip. The only problem is you don't get enough development of the characters because there isn't enough time. Maybe a few less would have been better. The best part of watching this movie in 2013 is to see the terrific cast and how they have all gone on to so much in their careers. Also a bit poignant how some of them have aged in the 20 years since. Good to see Jack Lemmon in one of his later roles. Madeleine Stowe is lovely. Tim Robbins and Peter Gallagher are quite hilarious. Worth a watch.

    I love movies that intertwine multiple stories and connect everything together with a nice big bow. However this present was far to big and ran out of wrapping paper. As the clich&eacute; goes ''more is less''. This film could have used less to make it more. I do understand the importance of character development but redundancy can leave you disinterested in one or even all the players. In fact, some of them seem disinterested with themselves and the events occurring around or directly to them. They all seem to have to much restraint when it comes to emotions. Was this the point? If so, perhaps another hour should have been added to the film to better explain why. Did I mention this film clocks in at just over 3hours? I'm usually very patient when it comes to long films, but 3hrs felt like 5 in this case. This is not a bad film, but you can get the same kind of entertainment sitting on a park bench for a few hours.

    Based on the short stories written by Raymond Carver. A vast array of different characters, all of them by some degree connected with one another, are living in the suburbs of LA. Two major events unite all of them: the helicopters spraying bug spray at the beginning of the film (setting the scene), and the earthquake that takes place at the end (ending all of the stories). Robert Altman once again doesn't fail to show his extreme exuberance and brightness in each one of the storiesnot even when dark subject matter is exposed and never fails to connect all of them with a grace and craftsmanship that very few other directors have. Structurally complex, cynical in its narrative tone and content, nearly impeccable in its execution (each one of the actors and actresses give an outstanding performance, another proof of Altman's directorial skills and talent), Short Cuts remains an American classic, not only for its larger-than-life format, but also for the influence it had on many subsequent films, such as P.T. Anderson's Magnolia and Todd Solondz's Happiness.

    ...I try to tell from inside the universe of one single human being I become speechless because I cannot decide what to say and what to conceal. But not these three men who wrote this screenplay like a symphony between Bach and Jazz - and Mark Ishams music is the same kind - divinely brilliant. A novel? Two? Three, five? Or is this all hackneyed phrases? Is there a difference at all? Three hours full of moments I found myself smiling and slightly shaking my head at the same time. Never saw such a lot of 'perfect pairs' as in "Short Cuts"! The set dressing and costume design are straight to the point. Always winking. Don't worry about little earthquakes. Never get a breakfast in a diner without sunnies. And don't lose heart because of a body in the river... Simply enjoy - inside the prison of life :-)

    Ever see someone train a dog by pushing its nose into its feces? This movie is that for 3 hours (oui, you're the dog). You watch depressed/ angry/ unpleasant characters flit and interact. There isn't one redeeming/ uplifting/ positive/ life-affirming moment. OK, wait: In the end, Waits & Tomlin celebrate their poverty and alcoholism in a dreary trailer; Robbins has sex with Stowe and brings the dog back home; MacDowell & Davison eat pastries with baker Lovett after their child dies. Yeah, sorry, all upbeat stuff. Altman was a brilliant creator (3 Women, Nashville, Mash), capturing the American panorama and subconscious like no other director. Amazing in the range of topics he undertook. But over time he relied increasingly on dialogue to move his (lack of) plot forward. For many this skim was the invisible hand of meaning - "What is he trying to say here? It's obscure so it's gravid." Short Cuts has all the Altman signatures: annoying lounge music that permeates everything, overlapping dialogue, characters staring at fish or fixed objects as they think about the meaning of life, overlapping dialogue, near-constant elevator jazz, characters who talk from the script and to the camera but not to each other, overlapping dialogue. It might be a TV show that charms via "lives of idiosyncratic, tortured, neurotic characters intersecting & intertwining in a fictional yet all-too-real city of desire, failed dreams ...." The kind of thing where folks say "OMG, that is SO my family". Except for the bit where Penn beats a girl to death with a rock; or the guy who took pictures of the girl he raped and strangled. Scenes or characters you might care or wonder about are never fully-explored; other scenes (eg. Lemmon's description of boinking his son's aunt) go on and on. And on. You got it, and still it continues. Perhaps this is a mirror that forces us to confront our inner selves while we confront our outer lives, as we reflect on .... There's some nice acting: Robbins, Stowe, Tomlin, Jason-Leigh, McDormand, Davison, Gallagher, Chris Penn, Lili Taylor, more. But almost anyone can get good performances out of these folks. Meryl Streep - sorry, I mean Julianne Moore - does her usual "watch me, I'm REALLY acting" - especially when she is nude from the waist-down in the pre-BBQ scene. Andie MacDowell, as always, squeezes her lack of range into playing herself. Same for Robert Downey Jr. and Lori Singer. Jack Lemmon does the stuttering, mumbling, rolling fingers uh-uh-uh alky-monologue thing that he (incredibly) made a career out of. His understudy Tom Waits does a gravelly-voice version of this. Boy, imagine if Altman had filmed an 8-hour version of an O'Neil play where Waits and Lemmon talk about life as they drink in a bar on a rainy day. Various characters could come and go, talking about the rain as they walk in; the bartender, perhaps a jaded Brian Blessed, would comment as he refilled their glasses .... Whew. Carver seemed to have insight, albeit through a whiskey glass, into the human spirit. But this movie version of his stories seems as contrived as a HS play. Look at the scene where Penn & Jason-Leigh consider having sex; or the photo-mixup scene; or the funeral scene where the dialogue approaches an Ibsen play: Sven opens his front door and a woman outside says "May I come in? I'm yust in town and I want to tell your father's last words as he died from syphilis ... yah, I'm your sister; the maid is your real mother; and the bank president, see the insanity in my left eye ..." Oofta, people do jump in like that in real life. I got to page 3 of the reviews without reading anything negative about Short Cuts. I infer from this that viewers think a stage production where actors tell, but don't show, is good art. There it is. I gave it a 7 and considered an 8. Several parts were so irritating that I winced and squirmed so it's certainly effective. Two sidebars: 1. If you think Carver would be difficult to bring to the screen, see the excellent Jindabyne. 2. Altman over time became like his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Alan Rudolph - vague and insubstantial - whereas Rudolph's quirkiness grew into meatier work.

    Altman, as many have written, had a career that is pretty much evenly divided between hit and miss. While I have always enjoyed his films, to be totally honest and fair, not all of his work qualifies to the magnificent high standard of being Altmanesque. Altman loved jazz, and the best of his best work move like a brilliant jazz performance. To move along with his groove, to truly become part of the experience requires a certain presence of mind. Like the greatest jazz artists, there are those who enter into deep debates over which work is best: is Kind Of Blue better than Bitches Brew? More important? In the end, it does come down to taste and preference, and this would be my second favorite Altman film after the sheer perfection of Nashville. The films are like watching someone make a quilt, "bit by bit, putting it together" (as Sondheim said), with no one particular thread being more important than another, just a simple, glorious collection of threads pulling together to form one majestic piece. The perception that his films are "scattered" or "confusing" or "dull" because of that missing story line is, sadly, understandable: we are being fed a constant stream of Single Story at every turn, being easier to market and exploit. Altman, at his best, had no need of a single narrative line and on those occasions in which there is no semblance whatsoever of a single story arc AND he is moving at his best, he creates films quite unlike any other by any one. Both this and Nashville are invitations, seductive in their own way: there is no fourth wall in these works, while we watch them, it is as if they are watching us.

    By the time Robert Altman directed Short Cuts, in 1993, his style of interconnected and quirky characters in the format of a large cast was becoming trendy. The nineties would see other famous examples of this approach by big name directors, notably Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994 and Paul Thomas Anderson's' Magnolia from 1999. There was even a Simpson's episode in this vein in 1996 called '22 Short Films About Springfield'. Even though Altman was one of the inventors of this style, or grouping of styles, Short Takes suffers some from being in the age of such movies, rather than a monumental predecessor. Altman came close to perfecting the large, interconnected ensemble film in 1975 with Nashville. This film was more of a portrait of a unique city with its own music and culture and a portrait of the times rather than a character study or a gripping pot boiler. So the title made sense. Perhaps an even more accurate title would have been Nashville 1975. Altman excited audiences by making a large scale portrait of a time and place, full of complexity and brimming with interesting little stories and people. By 1993, the charms of these new developments were starting to wear off, and the nineties would sap the creative reservoir (and audience patience) of such sprawling films. Nashville is a better film---it cracks with energy and humor, it radiates a cynicism that was new in the 70's but is now commonplace. Short cuts fails to be a larger portrait as Nashville was. Nashville's true main character was the city herself. All the pieces fit to make a larger structure. This large structure may have been gaudy and odd, but it was worth building. Short Takes takes place in L.A. Suburbs, but is not about them. It feels like it takes place there because it was convenient, not because Altman had developed a Nashville-like interest in the area. The stories are thus highly reliant on their connections, though these can feel contrived. There is too much material here, even for 3 hours, to mine much real depth with individuals, and so the shattered pieces of a whole are hurt by never fitting into a larger structure. Nashville was 'weird' because it was about a city, Short Takes is 'weird' because it is about nothing. It seems appropriate that this movie came from the age of Seinfeld. Nashville was better and more innovative, but Short Takes was still on the front edge of the nineties trend of piecemeal interconnection dramas. It seems unfair that Pulp Fiction is so much more heralded and Magnolia is more remembered and loved. Why? Pulp Fiction might be more silly fun, and Magnolia might be by arguably the most gifted director of the three, but Short takes feels left behind by these films even though it was first, from a historical point of view. Part of this comes from the tone. The film is not touching or dramatic in the conventional sense. The viewer doesn't care about anyone in particular. We feel as upset for the girl killed by Chris Penn's character (she has only a few lines) as we do for anyone. Through its sheer fun Pulp Fiction makes you care about the characters in at least a passing way. Magnolia is a web of quirky, interconnected characters, but has more thematic and emotional focus. Short Cuts feels insincere at times, dramatically, and falls into clich&eacute;s which are amplified by the lack of time any one line of a character is given. The attempts at darkish humor fall flat or feel confusing as to whether they are serious or tongue in cheek. Despite a huge cast of huge names, the actors seem as confused and aimless as the audience. There are very good actors everywhere here and so sometimes good acting comes here and there, but there is a subdued feeling like all the talent has been handicapped. This is a good film if you are in a patient mood, but far from Altman's best work. Six stars.

Tim Robbins and Peter Gallagher are quite hilarious. Worth a watch.

    I love movies that intertwine multiple stories and connect everything together with a nice big bow. However this present was far to big and ran out of wrapping paper. As the clich&eacute; goes ''more is less''. This film could have used less to make it more. I do understand the importance of character development but redundancy can leave you disinterested in one or even all the players. In fact, some of them seem disinterested with themselves and the events occurring around or directly to them. They all seem to have to much restraint when it comes to emotions. Was this the point? If so, perhaps another hour should have been added to the film to better explain why. Did I mention this film clocks in at just over 3hours? I'm usually very patient when it comes to long films, but 3hrs felt like 5 in this case. This is not a bad film, but you can get the same kind of entertainment sitting on a park bench for a few hours.

    Based on the short stories written by Raymond Carver. A vast array of different characters, all of them by some degree connected with one another, are living in the suburbs of LA. Two major events unite all of them: the helicopters spraying bug spray at the beginning of the film (setting the scene), and the earthquake that takes place at the end (ending all of the stories). Robert Altman once again doesn't fail to show his extreme exuberance and brightness in each one of the storiesnot even when dark subject matter is exposed and never fails to connect all of them with a grace and craftsmanship that very few other directors have. Structurally complex, cynical in its narrative tone and content, nearly impeccable in its execution (each one of the actors and actresses give an outstanding performance, another proof of Altman's directorial skills and talent), Short Cuts remains an American classic, not only for its larger-than-life format, but also for the influence it had on many subsequent films, such as P.T. Anderson's Magnolia and Todd Solondz's Happiness.

    ...I try to tell from inside the universe of one single human being I become speechless because I cannot decide what to say and what to conceal. But not these three men who wrote this screenplay like a symphony between Bach and Jazz - and Mark Ishams music is the same kind - divinely brilliant. A novel? Two? Three, five? Or is this all hackneyed phrases? Is there a difference at all? Three hours full of moments I found myself smiling and slightly shaking my head at the same time. Never saw such a lot of 'perfect pairs' as in "Short Cuts"! The set dressing and costume design are straight to the point. Always winking. Don't worry about little earthquakes. Never get a breakfast in a diner without sunnies. And don't lose heart because of a body in the river... Simply enjoy - inside the prison of life :-)

    Ever see someone train a dog by pushing its nose into its feces? This movie is that for 3 hours (oui, you're the dog). You watch depressed/ angry/ unpleasant characters flit and interact. There isn't one redeeming/ uplifting/ positive/ life-affirming moment. OK, wait: In the end, Waits & Tomlin celebrate their poverty and alcoholism in a dreary trailer; Robbins has sex with Stowe and brings the dog back home; MacDowell & Davison eat pastries with baker Lovett after their child dies. Yeah, sorry, all upbeat stuff. Altman was a brilliant creator (3 Women, Nashville, Mash), capturing the American panorama and subconscious like no other director. Amazing in the range of topics he undertook. But over time he relied increasingly on dialogue to move his (lack of) plot forward. For many this skim was the invisible hand of meaning - "What is he trying to say here? It's obscure so it's gravid." Short Cuts has all the Altman signatures: annoying lounge music that permeates everything, overlapping dialogue, characters staring at fish or fixed objects as they think about the meaning of life, overlapping dialogue, near-constant elevator jazz, characters who talk from the script and to the camera but not to each other, overlapping dialogue. It might be a TV show that charms via "lives of idiosyncratic, tortured, neurotic characters intersecting & intertwining in a fictional yet all-too-real city of desire, failed dreams ...." The kind of thing where folks say "OMG, that is SO my family". Except for the bit where Penn beats a girl to death with a rock; or the guy who took pictures of the girl he raped and strangled. Scenes or characters you might care or wonder about are never fully-explored; other scenes (eg. Lemmon's description of boinking his son's aunt) go on and on. And on. You got it, and still it continues. Perhaps this is a mirror that forces us to confront our inner selves while we confront our outer lives, as we reflect on .... There's some nice acting: Robbins, Stowe, Tomlin, Jason-Leigh, McDormand, Davison, Gallagher, Chris Penn, Lili Taylor, more. But almost anyone can get good performances out of these folks. Meryl Streep - sorry, I mean Julianne Moore - does her usual "watch me, I'm REALLY acting" - especially when she is nude from the waist-down in the pre-BBQ scene. Andie MacDowell, as always, squeezes her lack of range into playing herself. Same for Robert Downey Jr. and Lori Singer. Jack Lemmon does the stuttering, mumbling, rolling fingers uh-uh-uh alky-monologue thing that he (incredibly) made a career out of. His understudy Tom Waits does a gravelly-voice version of this. Boy, imagine if Altman had filmed an 8-hour version of an O'Neil play where Waits and Lemmon talk about life as they drink in a bar on a rainy day. Various characters could come and go, talking about the rain as they walk in; the bartender, perhaps a jaded Brian Blessed, would comment as he refilled their glasses .... Whew. Carver seemed to have insight, albeit through a whiskey glass, into the human spirit. But this movie version of his stories seems as contrived as a HS play. Look at the scene where Penn & Jason-Leigh consider having sex; or the photo-mixup scene; or the funeral scene where the dialogue approaches an Ibsen play: Sven opens his front door and a woman outside says "May I come in? I'm yust in town and I want to tell your father's last words as he died from syphilis ... yah, I'm your sister; the maid is your real mother; and the bank president, see the insanity in my left eye ..." Oofta, people do jump in like that in real life. I got to page 3 of the reviews without reading anything negative about Short Cuts. I infer from this that viewers think a stage production where actors tell, but don't show, is good art. There it is. I gave it a 7 and considered an 8. Several parts were so irritating that I winced and squirmed so it's certainly effective. Two sidebars: 1. If you think Carver would be difficult to bring to the screen, see the excellent Jindabyne. 2. Altman over time became like his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Alan Rudolph - vague and insubstantial - whereas Rudolph's quirkiness grew into meatier work.

    Altman, as many have written, had a career that is pretty much evenly divided between hit and miss. While I have always enjoyed his films, to be totally honest and fair, not all of his work qualifies to the magnificent high standard of being Altmanesque. Altman loved jazz, and the best of his best work move like a brilliant jazz performance. To move along with his groove, to truly become part of the experience requires a certain presence of mind. Like the greatest jazz artists, there are those who enter into deep debates over which work is best: is Kind Of Blue better than Bitches Brew? More important? In the end, it does come down to taste and preference, and this would be my second favorite Altman film after the sheer perfection of Nashville. The films are like watching someone make a quilt, "bit by bit, putting it together" (as Sondheim said), with no one particular thread being more important than another, just a simple, glorious collection of threads pulling together to form one majestic piece. The perception that his films are "scattered" or "confusing" or "dull" because of that missing story line is, sadly, understandable: we are being fed a constant stream of Single Story at every turn, being easier to market and exploit. Altman, at his best, had no need of a single narrative line and on those occasions in which there is no semblance whatsoever of a single story arc AND he is moving at his best, he creates films quite unlike any other by any one. Both this and Nashville are invitations, seductive in their own way: there is no fourth wall in these works, while we watch them, it is as if they are watching us.

    By the time Robert Altman directed Short Cuts, in 1993, his style of interconnected and quirky characters in the format of a large cast was becoming trendy. The nineties would see other famous examples of this approach by big name directors, notably Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994 and Paul Thomas Anderson's' Magnolia from 1999. There was even a Simpson's episode in this vein in 1996 called '22 Short Films About Springfield'. Even though Altman was one of the inventors of this style, or grouping of styles, Short Takes suffers some from being in the age of such movies, rather than a monumental predecessor. Altman came close to perfecting the large, interconnected ensemble film in 1975 with Nashville. This film was more of a portrait of a unique city with its own music and culture and a portrait of the times rather than a character study or a gripping pot boiler. So the title made sense. Perhaps an even more accurate title would have been Nashville 1975. Altman excited audiences by making a large scale portrait of a time and place, full of complexity and brimming with interesting little stories and people. By 1993, the charms of these new developments were starting to wear off, and the nineties would sap the creative reservoir (and audience patience) of such sprawling films. Nashville is a better film---it cracks with energy and humor, it radiates a cynicism that was new in the 70's but is now commonplace. Short cuts fails to be a larger portrait as Nashville was. Nashville's true main character was the city herself. All the pieces fit to make a larger structure. This large structure may have been gaudy and odd, but it was worth building. Short Takes takes place in L.A. Suburbs, but is not about them. It feels like it takes place there because it was convenient, not because Altman had developed a Nashville-like interest in the area. The stories are thus highly reliant on their connections, though these can feel contrived. There is too much material here, even for 3 hours, to mine much real depth with individuals, and so the shattered pieces of a whole are hurt by never fitting into a larger structure. Nashville was 'weird' because it was about a city, Short Takes is 'weird' because it is about nothing. It seems appropriate that this movie came from the age of Seinfeld. Nashville was better and more innovative, but Short Takes was still on the front edge of the nineties trend of piecemeal interconnection dramas. It seems unfair that Pulp Fiction is so much more heralded and Magnolia is more remembered and loved. Why? Pulp Fiction might be more silly fun, and Magnolia might be by arguably the most gifted director of the three, but Short takes feels left behind by these films even though it was first, from a historical point of view. Part of this comes from the tone. The film is not touching or dramatic in the conventional sense. The viewer doesn't care about anyone in particular. We feel as upset for the girl killed by Chris Penn's character (she has only a few lines) as we do for anyone. Through its sheer fun Pulp Fiction makes you care about the characters in at least a passing way. Magnolia is a web of quirky, interconnected characters, but has more thematic and emotional focus. Short Cuts feels insincere at times, dramatically, and falls into clich&eacute;s which are amplified by the lack of time any one line of a character is given. The attempts at darkish humor fall flat or feel confusing as to whether they are serious or tongue in cheek. Despite a huge cast of huge names, the actors seem as confused and aimless as the audience. There are very good actors everywhere here and so sometimes good acting comes here and there, but there is a subdued feeling like all the talent has been handicapped. This is a good film if you are in a patient mood, but far from Altman's best work. Six stars.

    Another impressive Robert Altman ensemble piece, for the most part. Short Cuts brings us a look into the lives of an extensive number of Los Angeles residents, interconnecting in sometimes loose and sometimes more direct ways. We see doctors, singers, mothers, waitresses and plenty more, all done in the fluid and rhythmic fashion that one would expect from the man who brought us Nashville. Short Cuts feels very much like an L.A. film; there's a controlled chaos to it all that feels frenzied but in a strange way that lets you know that Altman is still behind the wheel. Over the course of the film we delve further into the lives of each individual, focusing on a few and exploring them deeper through Altman's heavy themes of morality and mortality (the film is based on a collection of short stories by Raymond Carver). It's a film that if it hits you right could get you doing a lot of self-reflecting on life and death, which is always a powerful thing to resonate within an audience. The most surprising thing about the film for me was how quickly it went by. Coming in at a running time of over 180 minutes, I was always quite intimidated by it and was expecting at least part of it to drag no matter how good the overall product was, but it flew by. Altman has this indescribable way to pace these epic ensemble pieces that make them feel so fluid and complete, keeping the focus on each character just long enough to unfold another layer but moving on to the next before it starts to drag. It's really one of the more impressive things about his capabilities as a director, how magnificently paced they are. For the majority of Short Cuts I was very impressed with everything that he was able to draw out of his cast; the emotions felt so genuine and, as he did in Nashville, the performances were mostly authentic and deeply lived-in. I don't think that it mixes the comedic and dramatic elements as well as it could have, but there was an understated quality to the dark themes that made it feel a lot more natural than if he had poured on the melodrama thick, which he easily could have given the material. Here he works with more established names than he did in something like Nashville, but there was a real lack of vanity from the actors, none of them allowing their prominence to overshadow anything else about the rest of the ensemble. Altman brings all of these characters together in a way that feels alive but not overly cinematic, expertly staged and paced...for the majority of it. There's a scene where Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine's characters get into an argument over a possible infidelity of hers, and it's around this scene that the film takes a bizarre turn for the worse. The performances that used to feel so genuine were all of a sudden desperately forced, the understated emotions that were allowed to build were now coming to the surface and were so melodramatic and shoved down the throat of the audience. It was as if Altman and the cast took everything that was working so well about it beforehand and decided to do everything in the completely opposite fashion for the final stretch. I struggle to think of a film that took such a dramatic shift, especially so late in it's game. By the time we reach the heavy-handed climax to bring together the universality of the characters, I wanted to scream at how desperate it all had become. It felt as though Altman had stepped down from his chair and let someone much less skilled than he come in and try to finish it, but they just hacked it to pieces. Short Cuts is a very good film for 150 minutes that is almost derailed by it's final 30.

    I saw this movie again last night and, like an old friend with which you had a bit of disagreement long ago but you are happy to see again, I found it most enjoyable. Well, enjoyable by an artistic, cinematic point of view. Certainly not by a human point of view since at the end, the shallowness and downright ugliness of some of the characters, came back to make me feel again that lingering subtle sense of depression at life being sometimes so unpalatable. That same bitterness at the back of your mouth after a not-so-honorable spree the night before. And yet the movie is one that you will never say: I've had enough of this. You do want to follow the different personas, their briefly brushing of self-contained lives, hoping a new story will develop, a redeeming character will appear. But no one enters from the left to shed light. Everyone is self-absorbed. I looked at the some of the other reviews to see if someone else had my same hunch and did not find any reference to what I think is Altman's inspiration for this canvas of American lives: Federico Fellini. Where La Dolce vita was a large fresco of a certain society at a certain point in time, here Altman wants to represent on a large, spread out mural a number of characters loosely connected or separated by their own materialism, hoping that, in the end, what the viewer sees is the colors and shape of a bustling city that can only be L.A. Where Fellini had a Ulysses-like character (Mastroianni) representing himself and his awe at the confusing life of a cynical old city on the verge of modern materialism, Altman does not have an himself watching and connecting the stories but tries to be more objective, more detached, letting the individual stories develop kind of casually. This is because the script does not come from him, from his own experiences ( as I understand the aging singer character is his only contribution to the plot) but from a number of short stories written by someone else. So, where Fellini is telling us of his own fears, surprises and expectations Altman is recounting someone's else story, a story that he is trying to tell not interpret, hoping that it will speak to the viewers by itself. So, if Fellini's fresco reminds me of The Triumph of Death in the cemetery of Pisa, scary, bigger than life and never to be forgotten, Altman's work reminds me of those many , beautiful murals one can see all over the world: busy, colorful, confusing and devoid of perspective but which one goes away from with a bit of bitter aftertaste for not having told a more decisive, clear message. An 8 nonetheless.

    I got to see this film for the first time this past weekend. I was interested to see how they would tie all the stories together and how smoothly it would flow. With so much going on and so many characters, I felt it did a pretty good job at it. The problem I had with it was that most of the stories were quite boring. Many of them never came to an end when the film was over. And, the ones that did, appeared to be quick fix endings to patch plot holes. It was fun to see all the actors and actresses in their prime. Many gave great performances. I just felt the writing was weak. I would like to see this film re-written and attempted again.

    I'm glad I came across this Robert Altman movie set in Los Angeles. This is a long movie and has a lot of characters. Surprisingly if you concentrate it isn't too confusing who is who. It keeps you interested to see how things turned out for the different sets of people and piecing together the jigsaw is quite fun. The story isn't that predictable. Good mix of drama and bizarre comedy, even if some of the eccentric characters are a bit too way off. Liked the fishing trip. The only problem is you don't get enough development of the characters because there isn't enough time. Maybe a few less would have been better. The best part of watching this movie in 2013 is to see the terrific cast and how they have all gone on to so much in their careers. Also a bit poignant how some of them have aged in the 20 years since. Good to see Jack Lemmon in one of his later roles. Madeleine Stowe is lovely.

The perception that his films are "scattered" or "confusing" or "dull" because of that missing story line is, sadly, understandable: we are being fed a constant stream of Single Story at every turn, being easier to market and exploit. Altman, at his best, had no need of a single narrative line and on those occasions in which there is no semblance whatsoever of a single story arc AND he is moving at his best, he creates films quite unlike any other by any one. Both this and Nashville are invitations, seductive in their own way: there is no fourth wall in these works, while we watch them, it is as if they are watching us.

    By the time Robert Altman directed Short Cuts, in 1993, his style of interconnected and quirky characters in the format of a large cast was becoming trendy. The nineties would see other famous examples of this approach by big name directors, notably Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994 and Paul Thomas Anderson's' Magnolia from 1999. There was even a Simpson's episode in this vein in 1996 called '22 Short Films About Springfield'. Even though Altman was one of the inventors of this style, or grouping of styles, Short Takes suffers some from being in the age of such movies, rather than a monumental predecessor. Altman came close to perfecting the large, interconnected ensemble film in 1975 with Nashville. This film was more of a portrait of a unique city with its own music and culture and a portrait of the times rather than a character study or a gripping pot boiler. So the title made sense. Perhaps an even more accurate title would have been Nashville 1975. Altman excited audiences by making a large scale portrait of a time and place, full of complexity and brimming with interesting little stories and people. By 1993, the charms of these new developments were starting to wear off, and the nineties would sap the creative reservoir (and audience patience) of such sprawling films. Nashville is a better film---it cracks with energy and humor, it radiates a cynicism that was new in the 70's but is now commonplace. Short cuts fails to be a larger portrait as Nashville was. Nashville's true main character was the city herself. All the pieces fit to make a larger structure. This large structure may have been gaudy and odd, but it was worth building. Short Takes takes place in L.A. Suburbs, but is not about them. It feels like it takes place there because it was convenient, not because Altman had developed a Nashville-like interest in the area. The stories are thus highly reliant on their connections, though these can feel contrived. There is too much material here, even for 3 hours, to mine much real depth with individuals, and so the shattered pieces of a whole are hurt by never fitting into a larger structure. Nashville was 'weird' because it was about a city, Short Takes is 'weird' because it is about nothing. It seems appropriate that this movie came from the age of Seinfeld. Nashville was better and more innovative, but Short Takes was still on the front edge of the nineties trend of piecemeal interconnection dramas. It seems unfair that Pulp Fiction is so much more heralded and Magnolia is more remembered and loved. Why? Pulp Fiction might be more silly fun, and Magnolia might be by arguably the most gifted director of the three, but Short takes feels left behind by these films even though it was first, from a historical point of view. Part of this comes from the tone. The film is not touching or dramatic in the conventional sense. The viewer doesn't care about anyone in particular. We feel as upset for the girl killed by Chris Penn's character (she has only a few lines) as we do for anyone. Through its sheer fun Pulp Fiction makes you care about the characters in at least a passing way. Magnolia is a web of quirky, interconnected characters, but has more thematic and emotional focus. Short Cuts feels insincere at times, dramatically, and falls into clich&eacute;s which are amplified by the lack of time any one line of a character is given. The attempts at darkish humor fall flat or feel confusing as to whether they are serious or tongue in cheek. Despite a huge cast of huge names, the actors seem as confused and aimless as the audience. There are very good actors everywhere here and so sometimes good acting comes here and there, but there is a subdued feeling like all the talent has been handicapped. This is a good film if you are in a patient mood, but far from Altman's best work. Six stars.

    Another impressive Robert Altman ensemble piece, for the most part. Short Cuts brings us a look into the lives of an extensive number of Los Angeles residents, interconnecting in sometimes loose and sometimes more direct ways. We see doctors, singers, mothers, waitresses and plenty more, all done in the fluid and rhythmic fashion that one would expect from the man who brought us Nashville. Short Cuts feels very much like an L.A. film; there's a controlled chaos to it all that feels frenzied but in a strange way that lets you know that Altman is still behind the wheel. Over the course of the film we delve further into the lives of each individual, focusing on a few and exploring them deeper through Altman's heavy themes of morality and mortality (the film is based on a collection of short stories by Raymond Carver). It's a film that if it hits you right could get you doing a lot of self-reflecting on life and death, which is always a powerful thing to resonate within an audience. The most surprising thing about the film for me was how quickly it went by. Coming in at a running time of over 180 minutes, I was always quite intimidated by it and was expecting at least part of it to drag no matter how good the overall product was, but it flew by. Altman has this indescribable way to pace these epic ensemble pieces that make them feel so fluid and complete, keeping the focus on each character just long enough to unfold another layer but moving on to the next before it starts to drag. It's really one of the more impressive things about his capabilities as a director, how magnificently paced they are. For the majority of Short Cuts I was very impressed with everything that he was able to draw out of his cast; the emotions felt so genuine and, as he did in Nashville, the performances were mostly authentic and deeply lived-in. I don't think that it mixes the comedic and dramatic elements as well as it could have, but there was an understated quality to the dark themes that made it feel a lot more natural than if he had poured on the melodrama thick, which he easily could have given the material. Here he works with more established names than he did in something like Nashville, but there was a real lack of vanity from the actors, none of them allowing their prominence to overshadow anything else about the rest of the ensemble. Altman brings all of these characters together in a way that feels alive but not overly cinematic, expertly staged and paced...for the majority of it. There's a scene where Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine's characters get into an argument over a possible infidelity of hers, and it's around this scene that the film takes a bizarre turn for the worse. The performances that used to feel so genuine were all of a sudden desperately forced, the understated emotions that were allowed to build were now coming to the surface and were so melodramatic and shoved down the throat of the audience. It was as if Altman and the cast took everything that was working so well about it beforehand and decided to do everything in the completely opposite fashion for the final stretch. I struggle to think of a film that took such a dramatic shift, especially so late in it's game. By the time we reach the heavy-handed climax to bring together the universality of the characters, I wanted to scream at how desperate it all had become. It felt as though Altman had stepped down from his chair and let someone much less skilled than he come in and try to finish it, but they just hacked it to pieces. Short Cuts is a very good film for 150 minutes that is almost derailed by it's final 30.

    I saw this movie again last night and, like an old friend with which you had a bit of disagreement long ago but you are happy to see again, I found it most enjoyable. Well, enjoyable by an artistic, cinematic point of view. Certainly not by a human point of view since at the end, the shallowness and downright ugliness of some of the characters, came back to make me feel again that lingering subtle sense of depression at life being sometimes so unpalatable. That same bitterness at the back of your mouth after a not-so-honorable spree the night before. And yet the movie is one that you will never say: I've had enough of this. You do want to follow the different personas, their briefly brushing of self-contained lives, hoping a new story will develop, a redeeming character will appear. But no one enters from the left to shed light. Everyone is self-absorbed. I looked at the some of the other reviews to see if someone else had my same hunch and did not find any reference to what I think is Altman's inspiration for this canvas of American lives: Federico Fellini. Where La Dolce vita was a large fresco of a certain society at a certain point in time, here Altman wants to represent on a large, spread out mural a number of characters loosely connected or separated by their own materialism, hoping that, in the end, what the viewer sees is the colors and shape of a bustling city that can only be L.A. Where Fellini had a Ulysses-like character (Mastroianni) representing himself and his awe at the confusing life of a cynical old city on the verge of modern materialism, Altman does not have an himself watching and connecting the stories but tries to be more objective, more detached, letting the individual stories develop kind of casually. This is because the script does not come from him, from his own experiences ( as I understand the aging singer character is his only contribution to the plot) but from a number of short stories written by someone else. So, where Fellini is telling us of his own fears, surprises and expectations Altman is recounting someone's else story, a story that he is trying to tell not interpret, hoping that it will speak to the viewers by itself. So, if Fellini's fresco reminds me of The Triumph of Death in the cemetery of Pisa, scary, bigger than life and never to be forgotten, Altman's work reminds me of those many , beautiful murals one can see all over the world: busy, colorful, confusing and devoid of perspective but which one goes away from with a bit of bitter aftertaste for not having told a more decisive, clear message. An 8 nonetheless.

    I got to see this film for the first time this past weekend. I was interested to see how they would tie all the stories together and how smoothly it would flow. With so much going on and so many characters, I felt it did a pretty good job at it. The problem I had with it was that most of the stories were quite boring. Many of them never came to an end when the film was over. And, the ones that did, appeared to be quick fix endings to patch plot holes. It was fun to see all the actors and actresses in their prime. Many gave great performances. I just felt the writing was weak. I would like to see this film re-written and attempted again.

    I'm glad I came across this Robert Altman movie set in Los Angeles. This is a long movie and has a lot of characters. Surprisingly if you concentrate it isn't too confusing who is who. It keeps you interested to see how things turned out for the different sets of people and piecing together the jigsaw is quite fun. The story isn't that predictable. Good mix of drama and bizarre comedy, even if some of the eccentric characters are a bit too way off. Liked the fishing trip. The only problem is you don't get enough development of the characters because there isn't enough time. Maybe a few less would have been better. The best part of watching this movie in 2013 is to see the terrific cast and how they have all gone on to so much in their careers. Also a bit poignant how some of them have aged in the 20 years since. Good to see Jack Lemmon in one of his later roles. Madeleine Stowe is lovely. Tim Robbins and Peter Gallagher are quite hilarious. Worth a watch.

    I love movies that intertwine multiple stories and connect everything together with a nice big bow. However this present was far to big and ran out of wrapping paper. As the clich&eacute; goes ''more is less''. This film could have used less to make it more. I do understand the importance of character development but redundancy can leave you disinterested in one or even all the players. In fact, some of them seem disinterested with themselves and the events occurring around or directly to them. They all seem to have to much restraint when it comes to emotions. Was this the point? If so, perhaps another hour should have been added to the film to better explain why. Did I mention this film clocks in at just over 3hours? I'm usually very patient when it comes to long films, but 3hrs felt like 5 in this case. This is not a bad film, but you can get the same kind of entertainment sitting on a park bench for a few hours.

    Based on the short stories written by Raymond Carver. A vast array of different characters, all of them by some degree connected with one another, are living in the suburbs of LA. Two major events unite all of them: the helicopters spraying bug spray at the beginning of the film (setting the scene), and the earthquake that takes place at the end (ending all of the stories). Robert Altman once again doesn't fail to show his extreme exuberance and brightness in each one of the storiesnot even when dark subject matter is exposed and never fails to connect all of them with a grace and craftsmanship that very few other directors have. Structurally complex, cynical in its narrative tone and content, nearly impeccable in its execution (each one of the actors and actresses give an outstanding performance, another proof of Altman's directorial skills and talent), Short Cuts remains an American classic, not only for its larger-than-life format, but also for the influence it had on many subsequent films, such as P.T. Anderson's Magnolia and Todd Solondz's Happiness.

    ...I try to tell from inside the universe of one single human being I become speechless because I cannot decide what to say and what to conceal. But not these three men who wrote this screenplay like a symphony between Bach and Jazz - and Mark Ishams music is the same kind - divinely brilliant. A novel? Two? Three, five? Or is this all hackneyed phrases? Is there a difference at all? Three hours full of moments I found myself smiling and slightly shaking my head at the same time. Never saw such a lot of 'perfect pairs' as in "Short Cuts"! The set dressing and costume design are straight to the point. Always winking. Don't worry about little earthquakes. Never get a breakfast in a diner without sunnies. And don't lose heart because of a body in the river... Simply enjoy - inside the prison of life :-)

    Ever see someone train a dog by pushing its nose into its feces? This movie is that for 3 hours (oui, you're the dog). You watch depressed/ angry/ unpleasant characters flit and interact. There isn't one redeeming/ uplifting/ positive/ life-affirming moment. OK, wait: In the end, Waits & Tomlin celebrate their poverty and alcoholism in a dreary trailer; Robbins has sex with Stowe and brings the dog back home; MacDowell & Davison eat pastries with baker Lovett after their child dies. Yeah, sorry, all upbeat stuff. Altman was a brilliant creator (3 Women, Nashville, Mash), capturing the American panorama and subconscious like no other director. Amazing in the range of topics he undertook. But over time he relied increasingly on dialogue to move his (lack of) plot forward. For many this skim was the invisible hand of meaning - "What is he trying to say here? It's obscure so it's gravid." Short Cuts has all the Altman signatures: annoying lounge music that permeates everything, overlapping dialogue, characters staring at fish or fixed objects as they think about the meaning of life, overlapping dialogue, near-constant elevator jazz, characters who talk from the script and to the camera but not to each other, overlapping dialogue. It might be a TV show that charms via "lives of idiosyncratic, tortured, neurotic characters intersecting & intertwining in a fictional yet all-too-real city of desire, failed dreams ...." The kind of thing where folks say "OMG, that is SO my family". Except for the bit where Penn beats a girl to death with a rock; or the guy who took pictures of the girl he raped and strangled. Scenes or characters you might care or wonder about are never fully-explored; other scenes (eg. Lemmon's description of boinking his son's aunt) go on and on. And on. You got it, and still it continues. Perhaps this is a mirror that forces us to confront our inner selves while we confront our outer lives, as we reflect on .... There's some nice acting: Robbins, Stowe, Tomlin, Jason-Leigh, McDormand, Davison, Gallagher, Chris Penn, Lili Taylor, more. But almost anyone can get good performances out of these folks. Meryl Streep - sorry, I mean Julianne Moore - does her usual "watch me, I'm REALLY acting" - especially when she is nude from the waist-down in the pre-BBQ scene. Andie MacDowell, as always, squeezes her lack of range into playing herself. Same for Robert Downey Jr. and Lori Singer. Jack Lemmon does the stuttering, mumbling, rolling fingers uh-uh-uh alky-monologue thing that he (incredibly) made a career out of. His understudy Tom Waits does a gravelly-voice version of this. Boy, imagine if Altman had filmed an 8-hour version of an O'Neil play where Waits and Lemmon talk about life as they drink in a bar on a rainy day. Various characters could come and go, talking about the rain as they walk in; the bartender, perhaps a jaded Brian Blessed, would comment as he refilled their glasses .... Whew. Carver seemed to have insight, albeit through a whiskey glass, into the human spirit. But this movie version of his stories seems as contrived as a HS play. Look at the scene where Penn & Jason-Leigh consider having sex; or the photo-mixup scene; or the funeral scene where the dialogue approaches an Ibsen play: Sven opens his front door and a woman outside says "May I come in? I'm yust in town and I want to tell your father's last words as he died from syphilis ... yah, I'm your sister; the maid is your real mother; and the bank president, see the insanity in my left eye ..." Oofta, people do jump in like that in real life. I got to page 3 of the reviews without reading anything negative about Short Cuts. I infer from this that viewers think a stage production where actors tell, but don't show, is good art. There it is. I gave it a 7 and considered an 8. Several parts were so irritating that I winced and squirmed so it's certainly effective. Two sidebars: 1. If you think Carver would be difficult to bring to the screen, see the excellent Jindabyne. 2. Altman over time became like his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Alan Rudolph - vague and insubstantial - whereas Rudolph's quirkiness grew into meatier work.

    Altman, as many have written, had a career that is pretty much evenly divided between hit and miss. While I have always enjoyed his films, to be totally honest and fair, not all of his work qualifies to the magnificent high standard of being Altmanesque. Altman loved jazz, and the best of his best work move like a brilliant jazz performance. To move along with his groove, to truly become part of the experience requires a certain presence of mind. Like the greatest jazz artists, there are those who enter into deep debates over which work is best: is Kind Of Blue better than Bitches Brew? More important? In the end, it does come down to taste and preference, and this would be my second favorite Altman film after the sheer perfection of Nashville. The films are like watching someone make a quilt, "bit by bit, putting it together" (as Sondheim said), with no one particular thread being more important than another, just a simple, glorious collection of threads pulling together to form one majestic piece. The perception that his films are "scattered" or "confusing" or "dull" because of that missing story line is, sadly, understandable: we are being fed a constant stream of Single Story at every turn, being easier to market and exploit. Altman, at his best, had no need of a single narrative line and on those occasions in which there is no semblance whatsoever of a single story arc AND he is moving at his best, he creates films quite unlike any other by any one. Both this and Nashville are invitations, seductive in their own way: there is no fourth wall in these works, while we watch them, it is as if they are watching us.

Where La Dolce vita was a large fresco of a certain society at a certain point in time, here Altman wants to represent on a large, spread out mural a number of characters loosely connected or separated by their own materialism, hoping that, in the end, what the viewer sees is the colors and shape of a bustling city that can only be L.A. Where Fellini had a Ulysses-like character (Mastroianni) representing himself and his awe at the confusing life of a cynical old city on the verge of modern materialism, Altman does not have an himself watching and connecting the stories but tries to be more objective, more detached, letting the individual stories develop kind of casually. This is because the script does not come from him, from his own experiences ( as I understand the aging singer character is his only contribution to the plot) but from a number of short stories written by someone else. So, where Fellini is telling us of his own fears, surprises and expectations Altman is recounting someone's else story, a story that he is trying to tell not interpret, hoping that it will speak to the viewers by itself. So, if Fellini's fresco reminds me of The Triumph of Death in the cemetery of Pisa, scary, bigger than life and never to be forgotten, Altman's work reminds me of those many , beautiful murals one can see all over the world: busy, colorful, confusing and devoid of perspective but which one goes away from with a bit of bitter aftertaste for not having told a more decisive, clear message. An 8 nonetheless.

    I got to see this film for the first time this past weekend. I was interested to see how they would tie all the stories together and how smoothly it would flow. With so much going on and so many characters, I felt it did a pretty good job at it. The problem I had with it was that most of the stories were quite boring. Many of them never came to an end when the film was over. And, the ones that did, appeared to be quick fix endings to patch plot holes. It was fun to see all the actors and actresses in their prime. Many gave great performances. I just felt the writing was weak. I would like to see this film re-written and attempted again.
