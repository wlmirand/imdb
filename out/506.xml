 <sinopse>
  A rebellious young man with a troubled past comes to a new town, finding friends and enemies.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Jim Stark is the new kid in town. He has been in trouble elsewhere; that's why his family has had to move before. Here he hopes to find the love he doesn't get from his middle-class family. Though he finds some of this in his relation with Judy, and a form of it in both Plato's adulation and Ray's real concern for him, Jim must still prove himself to his peers in switchblade knife fights and "chickie" games in which cars race toward a seaside cliff.

    Look. I do not hate this movie even though I gave it 1 star. But here is why I did give it one star: It was a Friday in my Visual Arts 11 class as we got to watch this film Rebel Without a Cause with one of the most famous actors of all time. I enjoyed it...... at first. But, I noticed something, this movie is the story of angst, abuse and horrible people. This movie could be the most emotionally challenging film ever made. The way the dad abuses the girl, the way the parents fight all the time, the way that they don't care about anyone, the fact that they hate everything and everyone made me wonder If this was what my life had come to. If I was born to suffer through this, then congratulations, you definitely did it. I don't know why I would want to live in a world where this is considered "Entertainment." I cried for a long time. I never did finish watching this film. I never will. This movie played with my emotions and I nearly jumped out of a window. If you are autistic, have abusive parents, or have divorced parents or if you are just soft hearted, do not watch it. Stay away from it as far as you can. If you ever come across this movie, do not buy or rent it or download it from a torrent. You might regret it. I do not hate this film in any way. I only gave this a 1 because I felt my life was pathetic and worthless after watching half of this. No Rating.

    Nicholas Ray's "Rebel Without A Cause" stars James Dean as Jim Stark, a young man who clashes with his parents and classmates. Dean would die in a car accident four weeks prior to the film's release, lending a mythic resonance to his portrayal of a troubled teenager. A companion-piece to Ray's "Bigger Than Life" (1956), "Rebel Without A Cause" (1955) share's the latter film's voluptuous qualities. Ray's colours zap the eyes-balls, his emotions grand, his music pounding, the film's melodrama unashamedly bombastic. Elsewhere Ray's favourite preoccupations pop up: the existential malaise simmering beneath 1950s suburbia, castrated males who wish to affirm themselves, striking uses of the colour red (recalling his "Johnny Guitar"), lonely characters who find each other etc etc. Amplifying the film's alienation are Ray's sets, which include an abandoned mansion and a vast planetarium, in which lecturers speak of man's insignificance even as teens jostle for attention and adoration. Ray's films are oft about sensitive loners. Here he gives us three characters  Jim, Judy and Plato  who must negotiate strained familial circumstances. Plato's without parents, Judy's shown little affection by her dad and Jim views his father, who is unwilling to stand up to an overbearing wife, as being emasculated. All three struggle with prescribed gender roles, until the film ends with a climax in which the trio mix strength and sensitivity to form their own working family unit. The film's attempts at psychoanalysis are at times clunky. Plato's homosexual, a fact which he attempts to mask with violent masculinity. Jim's straight, but similarly displaced. "If only I belonged some place," he says, "some place where I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed!" Judy's likewise struggling with acceptance. On the cusp of womanhood, but still a child, she mimics everyone around her in an attempt to fit in. Despair and a longing for connection are traits common in Ray's films. That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism ("Man, existing alone, is of little consequence," one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of "Rebel" was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women. "Rebel Without a Cause" is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" predate it by almost a decade. "The Wild One" and "The Blackboard Jungle" beat "Rebel" by a few years as well. What's true is that "Rebel's" the first of a certain type of "teen problem picture". It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later. James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in "Rebel" has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult. After "In A Lonely Place", "Rebel Without A Cause" is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film. But though Ray's direction and camera work are strong throughout, the film's thin in a number of areas, particularly in its handling of Jim's parents. Ironically for a film about "rebelling", our cast's thoroughly conformist. They all want to fit in, to be embraced, and white heterosexual romance is the order of the day. "Rebel" has been accused by many critics of being sexist (an overbearing mother seems to be the cause of Jim's troubles) and of boosting the idea of traditional masculinity as being a necessity (Jim and Plato have emasculated or absent fathers), but Ray seems to be saying something else entirely. He asks what, exactly, is the definition of a man, and by what standards should a man be defined (breadwinner, leader, hunter etc). In this regard, the film both denounces and affirms traditional conceptions of masculinity/femininity, leading to its climax, in which our new Mother and Father essentially mourn the loss of their gay kid. Then came the 1960s. 8/10  Dated, overcooked and silly in places, but also excellent, and a fascinating cultural marker. Ray's style and outlook strongly resembles Vincente Minnelli's work during this period. Worth two viewings.

    Rebel Without A Cause is a great movie with a very good storyline that was probably very risky for the fifties and a very impressive cast,especially from the great James Dean in one of his most famous performances.The movie is very enjoyable and very easy to watch,although I did feel with that story that it could have been more exciting and thrilling,it was actually a lot more plain than its title may suggest.The best part of the movie was without a doubt James Dean,his performance was very inspired,he was clearly an amazing actor that died too young,his character was very creepy,brave and also lovable in a weird way,also Natalie Wood and Sam Mineo gave very impressive performances.The movie is definitely a must see for fans of this classic era of film. The son of an overhearing mother and a withdrawn father copes with the world through violence and alcohol.

    There is a more compelling sub-text running throughout than the accepted, facile storyline of rebellious teenagers suffering growing pains. There is nothing rebellious about this movie; it conforms and confirms cultural norms of the era. It's really about gender identity and how roles of men and women were defined in 1950s America. And, uh, well, back to "poop," James Dean's performance is over-wrought and self- indulgent. He emotes throughout the movie like a recently toilet trained teenager who can't hold anything incrying, moaning, bemoaning his life. His father, played effectively by Jim Backus, is an emasculated figure who tidies up the house wearing a ruffled apron. This poor specimen of a father figure is overridden and browbeaten by his supercilious, strident wife. The father is apparently not a "real man." He defers to his wife and lacks the courage to wear the pants in his own family. Jim is disappointed and ashamed of this role model of manhood. In this film masculine translates into bully with a knife, teen boys who group together challenging each other in dangerous games proving masculine supremacy. These are their self-defined "kicks," of which the "chickie run" proves fatal for Bud, the acknowledged king of the roost. Before the game's commencement the two opponents Jim and Bud face off positioned in their respective cars. Bud salutes his rival Jim christening him "toreador." Yah, this is it two bulls in the bullring locking horns in man-to-man combat. Natalie Wood, as Judy, is tormented by what she perceives is her father's withdrawal of love for her. The 16 year old craves his attention, which has lessened as she has matured. He smears off her lipstick, calls her a tramp. He is repulsed by her daughterly hugs and kisses she's now too old for that stuff. His discomfort with her demonstrative affection could more reasonably be affixed to a darker origin. Maybe Daddy is suppressing a taboo sexual desire for his own flesh and blood? Could it be?! Suppression is no stranger to Sal Mineo's character, Plato, a troubled gay kid, neglected by his parents, in frustration gunning down puppies and pining for the actor Alan Ladd whose photo he has pasted on the door of his school locker. But his desire for the man in the photo is displaced to his new friend Jim whom he stalks with devoted idolatry. All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word "rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers. They had the savvy to know they were offering a mislabeled dish to the public. They used a catchword that would entice an audience who were craving more representations of the still novel, media dubbed: Teenagers of the Rock 'n Roll Generation.

    Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' is a dramatic, teen movie from the 50's that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. There's no one clear message that's sent through this movie about these kid's lives or their families, which I think attributes to its ever-lasting value. This was a film that was made inbetween times of war, and really there was nothing about society to rebel against, hence the name "Rebel Without a Cause". Instead this movie focuses more on home matters and families, particularly through the eyes of the younger generation. These kids all seem to have something to prove to one another, and all want to be a part some group. Jim gets harassed by some punk kids, who manage get under his skin and drive him to do some dangerous things. Judy wants to be loved by her father, but her father doesn't feel inclined to show it. And Plato intends to find the family that he never had. If there was one message I could get out of this movie, it's finding your right place. Unfortunately not everybody ends up in the most perfect situation, but it is their own actions and intentions that lead them there. There was quite a bit of interesting symbolism I found in this movie as well. One scene Judy returns home after a fight with her father and is quickly greeted by her little brother, who hugs her and calls her all the names her father wouldn't call her, which to me shows the love between siblings the younger generation. Also, as mentioned before, the scene where Jim, Judy and Plato all hideaway in the abandoned mansion was one of the more heartwarming moments of the movie. This was one of my most favorite scenes in the movie, and I think told the most about the moral of the story. What these kids want is to be loved. And while it can't seem to work with their own dysfunctional families, they seek to find love in the form of starting their own.

    You will remember how Fonzie said that in an episode of "Happy Days" - he had a photo of James Dean in his locker, similar to the way Plato has a photo of Alan Ladd in his locker. This film sums up American society in the middle of the Fifties. I often feel that the Fifties are unfairly maligned - the Forties are all about the Second World War and the Swinging Sixties are the pop culture at its height. The Fifties are often dismissed as "that boring decade in between." Nothing could be further from the truth. To me, the Fifties was the decade when our modern world was born - the "counter-culture" started then, not in the Sixties. James Dean still seems like a modern young dude. So many powerful scenes in "Rebel" prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both said in interviews many years later how much they idolised Jimmy and what an influence on their acting careers he had. So many young actors have said the same in the decades since. There is no doubt this film is dated but yet that doesn't matter at all. Watching it is still a pure pleasure, thanks to Dean's performance. It deserves its legendary status and Jimmy's image will live forever because of it. There is not too much more that can be said that other reviewers haven't already said about this great film. For anyone in that difficult decade between the ages of 15 and 25, when you're struggling to transition from childhood to adulthood, it is a film you will instantly identify with. Bravo to the three young stars and to director Nicholas Ray. They all did a superb job, with Jimmy truly outstanding.

    I had high expectations for this "classic" and was sorely disappointed. The good: Nice to see some not-over-the-top fight/scuffle scenes (in today's movies the fight scenes usually involve each participant receiving at least a dozen lethal blows). Nice to see some familiar faces (Maria, Thurston Howell, The Chief) in their (relative) youth. These tiny saving graces are greatly overwhelmed by the bad: Ridiculous, unconvincing plot. Bad dialog. Caricaturesque characters. I can forgive the movie for not having stood the test of time (few movies from the 50s do), but hard to believe it was even considered a good movie at the time. I can only attribute the stratospheric stature of the film to the untimely death of James Dean. Purple Haze would have been a great song had Hendrix not died... but Rebel Without A Cause would be as forgotten as Curtain Call at Cactus Creek had James Dean lived to be 90. Or maybe even 30.

    So much has been written on this seminal film in the last fifty years that it seems rather superfluous to add to the mix. Nevertheless, despite some of its qualities striking contemporary audiences as decidedly old-fashioned and dated, this remains a film of remarkable familiarity to today's society. Whether intended or not, what Nicholas Ray has accomplished here is telling a story about themes which transcend all generations and eras: in this sense, it is a universal story. James Dean remains an iconic figure in today's culture thanks in large part to this film. He has become the embodiment of the restless, conflicted youth attempting to understand his own place in the world while trying to reconcile the growing disparity between himself and his parents. Indeed, it is quite obvious that parent-child relationship issues are at the heart of this film, though unique for its time in the fact that this story emphasizes all three youths come from "good" families; good in the sense that they are affluent, somewhat grounded and stable despite what lies beneath the surface. Loneliness and alienation permeate throughout the entire film and Ray uses his mastery of framing and color to emphasize these themes. He also portrays Jim, Judy and Plato as the fantastical ideal family, most evident in the scene in the abandoned mansion. Unable to deal with the worlds they dwell in, these youths form their own, which is soon to be invaded and attacked. Despite this seemingly silly material, Ray transcends it with his dynamic camera work and sympathetic eye. His legacy is one centered on looking at such characters with enduring empathy and this is his most famous example. Does it hold up a half century later? Some would challenge that thought, but it is important to note that whatever modern day viewers may think of the more dated elements of this film, the impact it had on its own time and the subsequent generations remains intact. It has found a special place within our memories, which may very well be all that Nicholas Ray wanted.

    One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made With A Brilliant Performance From James Dean.

    Rebel Without A Cause is simply a classic and not only one of the greatest teen films ever made,but one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with Brilliant performances from James Dean,Natalie Wood,Sal Mineo and the rest of the cast,great direction and writing,Rebel Without A Cause is one of the all time great classics of cinema and is one of my favorite films. Set in Los Angeles,California in 1955,Rebel Without A Cause tells the story of a troubled teen named Jim Stark(James Dean)who is a good kid,but is always getting into trouble making Jim and his parents moving to different cities. While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager. Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic "chickie run" all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today.The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is excellent. James Dean is simply brilliant and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is excellent and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest. Wood has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is great as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well. Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray. Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score. In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    i am a English movie fan but haven't watched much of old films. my range is mostly movies from late 90s till date. rarely i watch movies of 50s to 70s with proper ratings and all other researching. but this film caught me when i was completely open. i have a theory that 1999 was the best year for Hollywood as many of my favorites, all time favorites, long term no 1 movies are from this year containing matrix and fight club which changed my life forever. when i watched fight club on and half years back after that no movie moved me like this one. i was so much moved by it that no other movie seems to had similar effect on me. obviously every time after watching a good movie failing to touch me deep inside i researched for movie similar to fight club. recently while checking Wikipedia of fight club i found this movie many people found similar to fight club. i downloaded it without checking anything and saw. this will never replace fight club for me but now this movie has its own place. what a timeless masterpiece. as down looking as fight club and high on content and acting at the same time. hardly we find movies this entertaining made on social issues of particular time. time to meet fathers of film making. 50s let me see what you have.

That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism ("Man, existing alone, is of little consequence," one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of "Rebel" was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women. "Rebel Without a Cause" is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" predate it by almost a decade. "The Wild One" and "The Blackboard Jungle" beat "Rebel" by a few years as well. What's true is that "Rebel's" the first of a certain type of "teen problem picture". It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later. James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in "Rebel" has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult. After "In A Lonely Place", "Rebel Without A Cause" is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film. But though Ray's direction and camera work are strong throughout, the film's thin in a number of areas, particularly in its handling of Jim's parents. Ironically for a film about "rebelling", our cast's thoroughly conformist. They all want to fit in, to be embraced, and white heterosexual romance is the order of the day. "Rebel" has been accused by many critics of being sexist (an overbearing mother seems to be the cause of Jim's troubles) and of boosting the idea of traditional masculinity as being a necessity (Jim and Plato have emasculated or absent fathers), but Ray seems to be saying something else entirely. He asks what, exactly, is the definition of a man, and by what standards should a man be defined (breadwinner, leader, hunter etc). In this regard, the film both denounces and affirms traditional conceptions of masculinity/femininity, leading to its climax, in which our new Mother and Father essentially mourn the loss of their gay kid. Then came the 1960s. 8/10  Dated, overcooked and silly in places, but also excellent, and a fascinating cultural marker. Ray's style and outlook strongly resembles Vincente Minnelli's work during this period. Worth two viewings.

    Rebel Without A Cause is a great movie with a very good storyline that was probably very risky for the fifties and a very impressive cast,especially from the great James Dean in one of his most famous performances.The movie is very enjoyable and very easy to watch,although I did feel with that story that it could have been more exciting and thrilling,it was actually a lot more plain than its title may suggest.The best part of the movie was without a doubt James Dean,his performance was very inspired,he was clearly an amazing actor that died too young,his character was very creepy,brave and also lovable in a weird way,also Natalie Wood and Sam Mineo gave very impressive performances.The movie is definitely a must see for fans of this classic era of film. The son of an overhearing mother and a withdrawn father copes with the world through violence and alcohol.

    There is a more compelling sub-text running throughout than the accepted, facile storyline of rebellious teenagers suffering growing pains. There is nothing rebellious about this movie; it conforms and confirms cultural norms of the era. It's really about gender identity and how roles of men and women were defined in 1950s America. And, uh, well, back to "poop," James Dean's performance is over-wrought and self- indulgent. He emotes throughout the movie like a recently toilet trained teenager who can't hold anything incrying, moaning, bemoaning his life. His father, played effectively by Jim Backus, is an emasculated figure who tidies up the house wearing a ruffled apron. This poor specimen of a father figure is overridden and browbeaten by his supercilious, strident wife. The father is apparently not a "real man." He defers to his wife and lacks the courage to wear the pants in his own family. Jim is disappointed and ashamed of this role model of manhood. In this film masculine translates into bully with a knife, teen boys who group together challenging each other in dangerous games proving masculine supremacy. These are their self-defined "kicks," of which the "chickie run" proves fatal for Bud, the acknowledged king of the roost. Before the game's commencement the two opponents Jim and Bud face off positioned in their respective cars. Bud salutes his rival Jim christening him "toreador." Yah, this is it two bulls in the bullring locking horns in man-to-man combat. Natalie Wood, as Judy, is tormented by what she perceives is her father's withdrawal of love for her. The 16 year old craves his attention, which has lessened as she has matured. He smears off her lipstick, calls her a tramp. He is repulsed by her daughterly hugs and kisses she's now too old for that stuff. His discomfort with her demonstrative affection could more reasonably be affixed to a darker origin. Maybe Daddy is suppressing a taboo sexual desire for his own flesh and blood? Could it be?! Suppression is no stranger to Sal Mineo's character, Plato, a troubled gay kid, neglected by his parents, in frustration gunning down puppies and pining for the actor Alan Ladd whose photo he has pasted on the door of his school locker. But his desire for the man in the photo is displaced to his new friend Jim whom he stalks with devoted idolatry. All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word "rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers. They had the savvy to know they were offering a mislabeled dish to the public. They used a catchword that would entice an audience who were craving more representations of the still novel, media dubbed: Teenagers of the Rock 'n Roll Generation.

    Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' is a dramatic, teen movie from the 50's that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. There's no one clear message that's sent through this movie about these kid's lives or their families, which I think attributes to its ever-lasting value. This was a film that was made inbetween times of war, and really there was nothing about society to rebel against, hence the name "Rebel Without a Cause". Instead this movie focuses more on home matters and families, particularly through the eyes of the younger generation. These kids all seem to have something to prove to one another, and all want to be a part some group. Jim gets harassed by some punk kids, who manage get under his skin and drive him to do some dangerous things. Judy wants to be loved by her father, but her father doesn't feel inclined to show it. And Plato intends to find the family that he never had. If there was one message I could get out of this movie, it's finding your right place. Unfortunately not everybody ends up in the most perfect situation, but it is their own actions and intentions that lead them there. There was quite a bit of interesting symbolism I found in this movie as well. One scene Judy returns home after a fight with her father and is quickly greeted by her little brother, who hugs her and calls her all the names her father wouldn't call her, which to me shows the love between siblings the younger generation. Also, as mentioned before, the scene where Jim, Judy and Plato all hideaway in the abandoned mansion was one of the more heartwarming moments of the movie. This was one of my most favorite scenes in the movie, and I think told the most about the moral of the story. What these kids want is to be loved. And while it can't seem to work with their own dysfunctional families, they seek to find love in the form of starting their own.

    You will remember how Fonzie said that in an episode of "Happy Days" - he had a photo of James Dean in his locker, similar to the way Plato has a photo of Alan Ladd in his locker. This film sums up American society in the middle of the Fifties. I often feel that the Fifties are unfairly maligned - the Forties are all about the Second World War and the Swinging Sixties are the pop culture at its height. The Fifties are often dismissed as "that boring decade in between." Nothing could be further from the truth. To me, the Fifties was the decade when our modern world was born - the "counter-culture" started then, not in the Sixties. James Dean still seems like a modern young dude. So many powerful scenes in "Rebel" prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both said in interviews many years later how much they idolised Jimmy and what an influence on their acting careers he had. So many young actors have said the same in the decades since. There is no doubt this film is dated but yet that doesn't matter at all. Watching it is still a pure pleasure, thanks to Dean's performance. It deserves its legendary status and Jimmy's image will live forever because of it. There is not too much more that can be said that other reviewers haven't already said about this great film. For anyone in that difficult decade between the ages of 15 and 25, when you're struggling to transition from childhood to adulthood, it is a film you will instantly identify with. Bravo to the three young stars and to director Nicholas Ray. They all did a superb job, with Jimmy truly outstanding.

    I had high expectations for this "classic" and was sorely disappointed. The good: Nice to see some not-over-the-top fight/scuffle scenes (in today's movies the fight scenes usually involve each participant receiving at least a dozen lethal blows). Nice to see some familiar faces (Maria, Thurston Howell, The Chief) in their (relative) youth. These tiny saving graces are greatly overwhelmed by the bad: Ridiculous, unconvincing plot. Bad dialog. Caricaturesque characters. I can forgive the movie for not having stood the test of time (few movies from the 50s do), but hard to believe it was even considered a good movie at the time. I can only attribute the stratospheric stature of the film to the untimely death of James Dean. Purple Haze would have been a great song had Hendrix not died... but Rebel Without A Cause would be as forgotten as Curtain Call at Cactus Creek had James Dean lived to be 90. Or maybe even 30.

    So much has been written on this seminal film in the last fifty years that it seems rather superfluous to add to the mix. Nevertheless, despite some of its qualities striking contemporary audiences as decidedly old-fashioned and dated, this remains a film of remarkable familiarity to today's society. Whether intended or not, what Nicholas Ray has accomplished here is telling a story about themes which transcend all generations and eras: in this sense, it is a universal story. James Dean remains an iconic figure in today's culture thanks in large part to this film. He has become the embodiment of the restless, conflicted youth attempting to understand his own place in the world while trying to reconcile the growing disparity between himself and his parents. Indeed, it is quite obvious that parent-child relationship issues are at the heart of this film, though unique for its time in the fact that this story emphasizes all three youths come from "good" families; good in the sense that they are affluent, somewhat grounded and stable despite what lies beneath the surface. Loneliness and alienation permeate throughout the entire film and Ray uses his mastery of framing and color to emphasize these themes. He also portrays Jim, Judy and Plato as the fantastical ideal family, most evident in the scene in the abandoned mansion. Unable to deal with the worlds they dwell in, these youths form their own, which is soon to be invaded and attacked. Despite this seemingly silly material, Ray transcends it with his dynamic camera work and sympathetic eye. His legacy is one centered on looking at such characters with enduring empathy and this is his most famous example. Does it hold up a half century later? Some would challenge that thought, but it is important to note that whatever modern day viewers may think of the more dated elements of this film, the impact it had on its own time and the subsequent generations remains intact. It has found a special place within our memories, which may very well be all that Nicholas Ray wanted.

    One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made With A Brilliant Performance From James Dean.

    Rebel Without A Cause is simply a classic and not only one of the greatest teen films ever made,but one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with Brilliant performances from James Dean,Natalie Wood,Sal Mineo and the rest of the cast,great direction and writing,Rebel Without A Cause is one of the all time great classics of cinema and is one of my favorite films. Set in Los Angeles,California in 1955,Rebel Without A Cause tells the story of a troubled teen named Jim Stark(James Dean)who is a good kid,but is always getting into trouble making Jim and his parents moving to different cities. While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager. Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic "chickie run" all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today.The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is excellent. James Dean is simply brilliant and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is excellent and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest. Wood has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is great as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well. Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray. Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score. In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    i am a English movie fan but haven't watched much of old films. my range is mostly movies from late 90s till date. rarely i watch movies of 50s to 70s with proper ratings and all other researching. but this film caught me when i was completely open. i have a theory that 1999 was the best year for Hollywood as many of my favorites, all time favorites, long term no 1 movies are from this year containing matrix and fight club which changed my life forever. when i watched fight club on and half years back after that no movie moved me like this one. i was so much moved by it that no other movie seems to had similar effect on me. obviously every time after watching a good movie failing to touch me deep inside i researched for movie similar to fight club. recently while checking Wikipedia of fight club i found this movie many people found similar to fight club. i downloaded it without checking anything and saw. this will never replace fight club for me but now this movie has its own place. what a timeless masterpiece. as down looking as fight club and high on content and acting at the same time. hardly we find movies this entertaining made on social issues of particular time. time to meet fathers of film making. 50s let me see what you have.

    Look. I do not hate this movie even though I gave it 1 star. But here is why I did give it one star: It was a Friday in my Visual Arts 11 class as we got to watch this film Rebel Without a Cause with one of the most famous actors of all time. I enjoyed it...... at first. But, I noticed something, this movie is the story of angst, abuse and horrible people. This movie could be the most emotionally challenging film ever made. The way the dad abuses the girl, the way the parents fight all the time, the way that they don't care about anyone, the fact that they hate everything and everyone made me wonder If this was what my life had come to. If I was born to suffer through this, then congratulations, you definitely did it. I don't know why I would want to live in a world where this is considered "Entertainment." I cried for a long time. I never did finish watching this film. I never will. This movie played with my emotions and I nearly jumped out of a window. If you are autistic, have abusive parents, or have divorced parents or if you are just soft hearted, do not watch it. Stay away from it as far as you can. If you ever come across this movie, do not buy or rent it or download it from a torrent. You might regret it. I do not hate this film in any way. I only gave this a 1 because I felt my life was pathetic and worthless after watching half of this. No Rating.

    Nicholas Ray's "Rebel Without A Cause" stars James Dean as Jim Stark, a young man who clashes with his parents and classmates. Dean would die in a car accident four weeks prior to the film's release, lending a mythic resonance to his portrayal of a troubled teenager. A companion-piece to Ray's "Bigger Than Life" (1956), "Rebel Without A Cause" (1955) share's the latter film's voluptuous qualities. Ray's colours zap the eyes-balls, his emotions grand, his music pounding, the film's melodrama unashamedly bombastic. Elsewhere Ray's favourite preoccupations pop up: the existential malaise simmering beneath 1950s suburbia, castrated males who wish to affirm themselves, striking uses of the colour red (recalling his "Johnny Guitar"), lonely characters who find each other etc etc. Amplifying the film's alienation are Ray's sets, which include an abandoned mansion and a vast planetarium, in which lecturers speak of man's insignificance even as teens jostle for attention and adoration. Ray's films are oft about sensitive loners. Here he gives us three characters  Jim, Judy and Plato  who must negotiate strained familial circumstances. Plato's without parents, Judy's shown little affection by her dad and Jim views his father, who is unwilling to stand up to an overbearing wife, as being emasculated. All three struggle with prescribed gender roles, until the film ends with a climax in which the trio mix strength and sensitivity to form their own working family unit. The film's attempts at psychoanalysis are at times clunky. Plato's homosexual, a fact which he attempts to mask with violent masculinity. Jim's straight, but similarly displaced. "If only I belonged some place," he says, "some place where I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed!" Judy's likewise struggling with acceptance. On the cusp of womanhood, but still a child, she mimics everyone around her in an attempt to fit in. Despair and a longing for connection are traits common in Ray's films. That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism ("Man, existing alone, is of little consequence," one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of "Rebel" was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women. "Rebel Without a Cause" is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" predate it by almost a decade. "The Wild One" and "The Blackboard Jungle" beat "Rebel" by a few years as well. What's true is that "Rebel's" the first of a certain type of "teen problem picture". It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later. James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in "Rebel" has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult. After "In A Lonely Place", "Rebel Without A Cause" is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film. But though Ray's direction and camera work are strong throughout, the film's thin in a number of areas, particularly in its handling of Jim's parents. Ironically for a film about "rebelling", our cast's thoroughly conformist. They all want to fit in, to be embraced, and white heterosexual romance is the order of the day. "Rebel" has been accused by many critics of being sexist (an overbearing mother seems to be the cause of Jim's troubles) and of boosting the idea of traditional masculinity as being a necessity (Jim and Plato have emasculated or absent fathers), but Ray seems to be saying something else entirely. He asks what, exactly, is the definition of a man, and by what standards should a man be defined (breadwinner, leader, hunter etc). In this regard, the film both denounces and affirms traditional conceptions of masculinity/femininity, leading to its climax, in which our new Mother and Father essentially mourn the loss of their gay kid. Then came the 1960s. 8/10  Dated, overcooked and silly in places, but also excellent, and a fascinating cultural marker. Ray's style and outlook strongly resembles Vincente Minnelli's work during this period. Worth two viewings.

Yah, this is it two bulls in the bullring locking horns in man-to-man combat. Natalie Wood, as Judy, is tormented by what she perceives is her father's withdrawal of love for her. The 16 year old craves his attention, which has lessened as she has matured. He smears off her lipstick, calls her a tramp. He is repulsed by her daughterly hugs and kisses she's now too old for that stuff. His discomfort with her demonstrative affection could more reasonably be affixed to a darker origin. Maybe Daddy is suppressing a taboo sexual desire for his own flesh and blood? Could it be?! Suppression is no stranger to Sal Mineo's character, Plato, a troubled gay kid, neglected by his parents, in frustration gunning down puppies and pining for the actor Alan Ladd whose photo he has pasted on the door of his school locker. But his desire for the man in the photo is displaced to his new friend Jim whom he stalks with devoted idolatry. All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word "rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers. They had the savvy to know they were offering a mislabeled dish to the public. They used a catchword that would entice an audience who were craving more representations of the still novel, media dubbed: Teenagers of the Rock 'n Roll Generation.

    Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' is a dramatic, teen movie from the 50's that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. There's no one clear message that's sent through this movie about these kid's lives or their families, which I think attributes to its ever-lasting value. This was a film that was made inbetween times of war, and really there was nothing about society to rebel against, hence the name "Rebel Without a Cause". Instead this movie focuses more on home matters and families, particularly through the eyes of the younger generation. These kids all seem to have something to prove to one another, and all want to be a part some group. Jim gets harassed by some punk kids, who manage get under his skin and drive him to do some dangerous things. Judy wants to be loved by her father, but her father doesn't feel inclined to show it. And Plato intends to find the family that he never had. If there was one message I could get out of this movie, it's finding your right place. Unfortunately not everybody ends up in the most perfect situation, but it is their own actions and intentions that lead them there. There was quite a bit of interesting symbolism I found in this movie as well. One scene Judy returns home after a fight with her father and is quickly greeted by her little brother, who hugs her and calls her all the names her father wouldn't call her, which to me shows the love between siblings the younger generation. Also, as mentioned before, the scene where Jim, Judy and Plato all hideaway in the abandoned mansion was one of the more heartwarming moments of the movie. This was one of my most favorite scenes in the movie, and I think told the most about the moral of the story. What these kids want is to be loved. And while it can't seem to work with their own dysfunctional families, they seek to find love in the form of starting their own.

    You will remember how Fonzie said that in an episode of "Happy Days" - he had a photo of James Dean in his locker, similar to the way Plato has a photo of Alan Ladd in his locker. This film sums up American society in the middle of the Fifties. I often feel that the Fifties are unfairly maligned - the Forties are all about the Second World War and the Swinging Sixties are the pop culture at its height. The Fifties are often dismissed as "that boring decade in between." Nothing could be further from the truth. To me, the Fifties was the decade when our modern world was born - the "counter-culture" started then, not in the Sixties. James Dean still seems like a modern young dude. So many powerful scenes in "Rebel" prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both said in interviews many years later how much they idolised Jimmy and what an influence on their acting careers he had. So many young actors have said the same in the decades since. There is no doubt this film is dated but yet that doesn't matter at all. Watching it is still a pure pleasure, thanks to Dean's performance. It deserves its legendary status and Jimmy's image will live forever because of it. There is not too much more that can be said that other reviewers haven't already said about this great film. For anyone in that difficult decade between the ages of 15 and 25, when you're struggling to transition from childhood to adulthood, it is a film you will instantly identify with. Bravo to the three young stars and to director Nicholas Ray. They all did a superb job, with Jimmy truly outstanding.

    I had high expectations for this "classic" and was sorely disappointed. The good: Nice to see some not-over-the-top fight/scuffle scenes (in today's movies the fight scenes usually involve each participant receiving at least a dozen lethal blows). Nice to see some familiar faces (Maria, Thurston Howell, The Chief) in their (relative) youth. These tiny saving graces are greatly overwhelmed by the bad: Ridiculous, unconvincing plot. Bad dialog. Caricaturesque characters. I can forgive the movie for not having stood the test of time (few movies from the 50s do), but hard to believe it was even considered a good movie at the time. I can only attribute the stratospheric stature of the film to the untimely death of James Dean. Purple Haze would have been a great song had Hendrix not died... but Rebel Without A Cause would be as forgotten as Curtain Call at Cactus Creek had James Dean lived to be 90. Or maybe even 30.

    So much has been written on this seminal film in the last fifty years that it seems rather superfluous to add to the mix. Nevertheless, despite some of its qualities striking contemporary audiences as decidedly old-fashioned and dated, this remains a film of remarkable familiarity to today's society. Whether intended or not, what Nicholas Ray has accomplished here is telling a story about themes which transcend all generations and eras: in this sense, it is a universal story. James Dean remains an iconic figure in today's culture thanks in large part to this film. He has become the embodiment of the restless, conflicted youth attempting to understand his own place in the world while trying to reconcile the growing disparity between himself and his parents. Indeed, it is quite obvious that parent-child relationship issues are at the heart of this film, though unique for its time in the fact that this story emphasizes all three youths come from "good" families; good in the sense that they are affluent, somewhat grounded and stable despite what lies beneath the surface. Loneliness and alienation permeate throughout the entire film and Ray uses his mastery of framing and color to emphasize these themes. He also portrays Jim, Judy and Plato as the fantastical ideal family, most evident in the scene in the abandoned mansion. Unable to deal with the worlds they dwell in, these youths form their own, which is soon to be invaded and attacked. Despite this seemingly silly material, Ray transcends it with his dynamic camera work and sympathetic eye. His legacy is one centered on looking at such characters with enduring empathy and this is his most famous example. Does it hold up a half century later? Some would challenge that thought, but it is important to note that whatever modern day viewers may think of the more dated elements of this film, the impact it had on its own time and the subsequent generations remains intact. It has found a special place within our memories, which may very well be all that Nicholas Ray wanted.

    Rebel Without A Cause is simply a classic and not only one of the greatest teen films ever made,but one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with Brilliant performances from James Dean,Natalie Wood,Sal Mineo and the rest of the cast,great direction and writing,Rebel Without A Cause is one of the all time great classics of cinema and is one of my favorite films. Set in Los Angeles,California in 1955,Rebel Without A Cause tells the story of a troubled teen named Jim Stark(James Dean)who is a good kid,but is always getting into trouble making Jim and his parents moving to different cities. While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager. Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic "chickie run" all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today.The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is excellent. James Dean is simply brilliant and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is excellent and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest. Wood has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is great as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well. Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray. Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score. In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    i am a English movie fan but haven't watched much of old films. my range is mostly movies from late 90s till date. rarely i watch movies of 50s to 70s with proper ratings and all other researching. but this film caught me when i was completely open. i have a theory that 1999 was the best year for Hollywood as many of my favorites, all time favorites, long term no 1 movies are from this year containing matrix and fight club which changed my life forever. when i watched fight club on and half years back after that no movie moved me like this one. i was so much moved by it that no other movie seems to had similar effect on me. obviously every time after watching a good movie failing to touch me deep inside i researched for movie similar to fight club. recently while checking Wikipedia of fight club i found this movie many people found similar to fight club. i downloaded it without checking anything and saw. this will never replace fight club for me but now this movie has its own place. what a timeless masterpiece. as down looking as fight club and high on content and acting at the same time. hardly we find movies this entertaining made on social issues of particular time. time to meet fathers of film making. 50s let me see what you have.

    Look. I do not hate this movie even though I gave it 1 star. But here is why I did give it one star: It was a Friday in my Visual Arts 11 class as we got to watch this film Rebel Without a Cause with one of the most famous actors of all time. I enjoyed it...... at first. But, I noticed something, this movie is the story of angst, abuse and horrible people. This movie could be the most emotionally challenging film ever made. The way the dad abuses the girl, the way the parents fight all the time, the way that they don't care about anyone, the fact that they hate everything and everyone made me wonder If this was what my life had come to. If I was born to suffer through this, then congratulations, you definitely did it. I don't know why I would want to live in a world where this is considered "Entertainment." I cried for a long time. I never did finish watching this film. I never will. This movie played with my emotions and I nearly jumped out of a window. If you are autistic, have abusive parents, or have divorced parents or if you are just soft hearted, do not watch it. Stay away from it as far as you can. If you ever come across this movie, do not buy or rent it or download it from a torrent. You might regret it. I do not hate this film in any way. I only gave this a 1 because I felt my life was pathetic and worthless after watching half of this. No Rating.

    Nicholas Ray's "Rebel Without A Cause" stars James Dean as Jim Stark, a young man who clashes with his parents and classmates. Dean would die in a car accident four weeks prior to the film's release, lending a mythic resonance to his portrayal of a troubled teenager. A companion-piece to Ray's "Bigger Than Life" (1956), "Rebel Without A Cause" (1955) share's the latter film's voluptuous qualities. Ray's colours zap the eyes-balls, his emotions grand, his music pounding, the film's melodrama unashamedly bombastic. Elsewhere Ray's favourite preoccupations pop up: the existential malaise simmering beneath 1950s suburbia, castrated males who wish to affirm themselves, striking uses of the colour red (recalling his "Johnny Guitar"), lonely characters who find each other etc etc. Amplifying the film's alienation are Ray's sets, which include an abandoned mansion and a vast planetarium, in which lecturers speak of man's insignificance even as teens jostle for attention and adoration. Ray's films are oft about sensitive loners. Here he gives us three characters  Jim, Judy and Plato  who must negotiate strained familial circumstances. Plato's without parents, Judy's shown little affection by her dad and Jim views his father, who is unwilling to stand up to an overbearing wife, as being emasculated. All three struggle with prescribed gender roles, until the film ends with a climax in which the trio mix strength and sensitivity to form their own working family unit. The film's attempts at psychoanalysis are at times clunky. Plato's homosexual, a fact which he attempts to mask with violent masculinity. Jim's straight, but similarly displaced. "If only I belonged some place," he says, "some place where I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed!" Judy's likewise struggling with acceptance. On the cusp of womanhood, but still a child, she mimics everyone around her in an attempt to fit in. Despair and a longing for connection are traits common in Ray's films. That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism ("Man, existing alone, is of little consequence," one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of "Rebel" was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women. "Rebel Without a Cause" is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" predate it by almost a decade. "The Wild One" and "The Blackboard Jungle" beat "Rebel" by a few years as well. What's true is that "Rebel's" the first of a certain type of "teen problem picture". It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later. James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in "Rebel" has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult. After "In A Lonely Place", "Rebel Without A Cause" is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film. But though Ray's direction and camera work are strong throughout, the film's thin in a number of areas, particularly in its handling of Jim's parents. Ironically for a film about "rebelling", our cast's thoroughly conformist. They all want to fit in, to be embraced, and white heterosexual romance is the order of the day. "Rebel" has been accused by many critics of being sexist (an overbearing mother seems to be the cause of Jim's troubles) and of boosting the idea of traditional masculinity as being a necessity (Jim and Plato have emasculated or absent fathers), but Ray seems to be saying something else entirely. He asks what, exactly, is the definition of a man, and by what standards should a man be defined (breadwinner, leader, hunter etc). In this regard, the film both denounces and affirms traditional conceptions of masculinity/femininity, leading to its climax, in which our new Mother and Father essentially mourn the loss of their gay kid. Then came the 1960s. 8/10  Dated, overcooked and silly in places, but also excellent, and a fascinating cultural marker. Ray's style and outlook strongly resembles Vincente Minnelli's work during this period. Worth two viewings.

    Rebel Without A Cause is a great movie with a very good storyline that was probably very risky for the fifties and a very impressive cast,especially from the great James Dean in one of his most famous performances.The movie is very enjoyable and very easy to watch,although I did feel with that story that it could have been more exciting and thrilling,it was actually a lot more plain than its title may suggest.The best part of the movie was without a doubt James Dean,his performance was very inspired,he was clearly an amazing actor that died too young,his character was very creepy,brave and also lovable in a weird way,also Natalie Wood and Sam Mineo gave very impressive performances.The movie is definitely a must see for fans of this classic era of film. The son of an overhearing mother and a withdrawn father copes with the world through violence and alcohol.

    There is a more compelling sub-text running throughout than the accepted, facile storyline of rebellious teenagers suffering growing pains. There is nothing rebellious about this movie; it conforms and confirms cultural norms of the era. It's really about gender identity and how roles of men and women were defined in 1950s America. And, uh, well, back to "poop," James Dean's performance is over-wrought and self- indulgent. He emotes throughout the movie like a recently toilet trained teenager who can't hold anything incrying, moaning, bemoaning his life. His father, played effectively by Jim Backus, is an emasculated figure who tidies up the house wearing a ruffled apron. This poor specimen of a father figure is overridden and browbeaten by his supercilious, strident wife. The father is apparently not a "real man." He defers to his wife and lacks the courage to wear the pants in his own family. Jim is disappointed and ashamed of this role model of manhood. In this film masculine translates into bully with a knife, teen boys who group together challenging each other in dangerous games proving masculine supremacy. These are their self-defined "kicks," of which the "chickie run" proves fatal for Bud, the acknowledged king of the roost. Before the game's commencement the two opponents Jim and Bud face off positioned in their respective cars. Bud salutes his rival Jim christening him "toreador." Yah, this is it two bulls in the bullring locking horns in man-to-man combat. Natalie Wood, as Judy, is tormented by what she perceives is her father's withdrawal of love for her. The 16 year old craves his attention, which has lessened as she has matured. He smears off her lipstick, calls her a tramp. He is repulsed by her daughterly hugs and kisses she's now too old for that stuff. His discomfort with her demonstrative affection could more reasonably be affixed to a darker origin. Maybe Daddy is suppressing a taboo sexual desire for his own flesh and blood? Could it be?! Suppression is no stranger to Sal Mineo's character, Plato, a troubled gay kid, neglected by his parents, in frustration gunning down puppies and pining for the actor Alan Ladd whose photo he has pasted on the door of his school locker. But his desire for the man in the photo is displaced to his new friend Jim whom he stalks with devoted idolatry. All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word "rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers. They had the savvy to know they were offering a mislabeled dish to the public. They used a catchword that would entice an audience who were craving more representations of the still novel, media dubbed: Teenagers of the Rock 'n Roll Generation.

So many powerful scenes in "Rebel" prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years.

    I had high expectations for this "classic" and was sorely disappointed. The good: Nice to see some not-over-the-top fight/scuffle scenes (in today's movies the fight scenes usually involve each participant receiving at least a dozen lethal blows). Nice to see some familiar faces (Maria, Thurston Howell, The Chief) in their (relative) youth. These tiny saving graces are greatly overwhelmed by the bad: Ridiculous, unconvincing plot. Bad dialog. Caricaturesque characters. I can forgive the movie for not having stood the test of time (few movies from the 50s do), but hard to believe it was even considered a good movie at the time. I can only attribute the stratospheric stature of the film to the untimely death of James Dean. Purple Haze would have been a great song had Hendrix not died... but Rebel Without A Cause would be as forgotten as Curtain Call at Cactus Creek had James Dean lived to be 90. Or maybe even 30.

    So much has been written on this seminal film in the last fifty years that it seems rather superfluous to add to the mix. Nevertheless, despite some of its qualities striking contemporary audiences as decidedly old-fashioned and dated, this remains a film of remarkable familiarity to today's society. Whether intended or not, what Nicholas Ray has accomplished here is telling a story about themes which transcend all generations and eras: in this sense, it is a universal story. James Dean remains an iconic figure in today's culture thanks in large part to this film. He has become the embodiment of the restless, conflicted youth attempting to understand his own place in the world while trying to reconcile the growing disparity between himself and his parents. Indeed, it is quite obvious that parent-child relationship issues are at the heart of this film, though unique for its time in the fact that this story emphasizes all three youths come from "good" families; good in the sense that they are affluent, somewhat grounded and stable despite what lies beneath the surface. Loneliness and alienation permeate throughout the entire film and Ray uses his mastery of framing and color to emphasize these themes. He also portrays Jim, Judy and Plato as the fantastical ideal family, most evident in the scene in the abandoned mansion. Unable to deal with the worlds they dwell in, these youths form their own, which is soon to be invaded and attacked. Despite this seemingly silly material, Ray transcends it with his dynamic camera work and sympathetic eye. His legacy is one centered on looking at such characters with enduring empathy and this is his most famous example. Does it hold up a half century later? Some would challenge that thought, but it is important to note that whatever modern day viewers may think of the more dated elements of this film, the impact it had on its own time and the subsequent generations remains intact. It has found a special place within our memories, which may very well be all that Nicholas Ray wanted.

    Rebel Without A Cause is simply a classic and not only one of the greatest teen films ever made,but one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with Brilliant performances from James Dean,Natalie Wood,Sal Mineo and the rest of the cast,great direction and writing,Rebel Without A Cause is one of the all time great classics of cinema and is one of my favorite films. Set in Los Angeles,California in 1955,Rebel Without A Cause tells the story of a troubled teen named Jim Stark(James Dean)who is a good kid,but is always getting into trouble making Jim and his parents moving to different cities. While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager. Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic "chickie run" all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today.The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is excellent. James Dean is simply brilliant and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is excellent and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest. Wood has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is great as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well. Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray. Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score. In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    i am a English movie fan but haven't watched much of old films. my range is mostly movies from late 90s till date. rarely i watch movies of 50s to 70s with proper ratings and all other researching. but this film caught me when i was completely open. i have a theory that 1999 was the best year for Hollywood as many of my favorites, all time favorites, long term no 1 movies are from this year containing matrix and fight club which changed my life forever. when i watched fight club on and half years back after that no movie moved me like this one. i was so much moved by it that no other movie seems to had similar effect on me. obviously every time after watching a good movie failing to touch me deep inside i researched for movie similar to fight club. recently while checking Wikipedia of fight club i found this movie many people found similar to fight club. i downloaded it without checking anything and saw. this will never replace fight club for me but now this movie has its own place. what a timeless masterpiece. as down looking as fight club and high on content and acting at the same time. hardly we find movies this entertaining made on social issues of particular time. time to meet fathers of film making. 50s let me see what you have.

    Look. I do not hate this movie even though I gave it 1 star. But here is why I did give it one star: It was a Friday in my Visual Arts 11 class as we got to watch this film Rebel Without a Cause with one of the most famous actors of all time. I enjoyed it...... at first. But, I noticed something, this movie is the story of angst, abuse and horrible people. This movie could be the most emotionally challenging film ever made. The way the dad abuses the girl, the way the parents fight all the time, the way that they don't care about anyone, the fact that they hate everything and everyone made me wonder If this was what my life had come to. If I was born to suffer through this, then congratulations, you definitely did it. I don't know why I would want to live in a world where this is considered "Entertainment." I cried for a long time. I never did finish watching this film. I never will. This movie played with my emotions and I nearly jumped out of a window. If you are autistic, have abusive parents, or have divorced parents or if you are just soft hearted, do not watch it. Stay away from it as far as you can. If you ever come across this movie, do not buy or rent it or download it from a torrent. You might regret it. I do not hate this film in any way. I only gave this a 1 because I felt my life was pathetic and worthless after watching half of this. No Rating.

    Nicholas Ray's "Rebel Without A Cause" stars James Dean as Jim Stark, a young man who clashes with his parents and classmates. Dean would die in a car accident four weeks prior to the film's release, lending a mythic resonance to his portrayal of a troubled teenager. A companion-piece to Ray's "Bigger Than Life" (1956), "Rebel Without A Cause" (1955) share's the latter film's voluptuous qualities. Ray's colours zap the eyes-balls, his emotions grand, his music pounding, the film's melodrama unashamedly bombastic. Elsewhere Ray's favourite preoccupations pop up: the existential malaise simmering beneath 1950s suburbia, castrated males who wish to affirm themselves, striking uses of the colour red (recalling his "Johnny Guitar"), lonely characters who find each other etc etc. Amplifying the film's alienation are Ray's sets, which include an abandoned mansion and a vast planetarium, in which lecturers speak of man's insignificance even as teens jostle for attention and adoration. Ray's films are oft about sensitive loners. Here he gives us three characters  Jim, Judy and Plato  who must negotiate strained familial circumstances. Plato's without parents, Judy's shown little affection by her dad and Jim views his father, who is unwilling to stand up to an overbearing wife, as being emasculated. All three struggle with prescribed gender roles, until the film ends with a climax in which the trio mix strength and sensitivity to form their own working family unit. The film's attempts at psychoanalysis are at times clunky. Plato's homosexual, a fact which he attempts to mask with violent masculinity. Jim's straight, but similarly displaced. "If only I belonged some place," he says, "some place where I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed!" Judy's likewise struggling with acceptance. On the cusp of womanhood, but still a child, she mimics everyone around her in an attempt to fit in. Despair and a longing for connection are traits common in Ray's films. That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism ("Man, existing alone, is of little consequence," one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of "Rebel" was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women. "Rebel Without a Cause" is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" predate it by almost a decade. "The Wild One" and "The Blackboard Jungle" beat "Rebel" by a few years as well. What's true is that "Rebel's" the first of a certain type of "teen problem picture". It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later. James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in "Rebel" has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult. After "In A Lonely Place", "Rebel Without A Cause" is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film. But though Ray's direction and camera work are strong throughout, the film's thin in a number of areas, particularly in its handling of Jim's parents. Ironically for a film about "rebelling", our cast's thoroughly conformist. They all want to fit in, to be embraced, and white heterosexual romance is the order of the day. "Rebel" has been accused by many critics of being sexist (an overbearing mother seems to be the cause of Jim's troubles) and of boosting the idea of traditional masculinity as being a necessity (Jim and Plato have emasculated or absent fathers), but Ray seems to be saying something else entirely. He asks what, exactly, is the definition of a man, and by what standards should a man be defined (breadwinner, leader, hunter etc). In this regard, the film both denounces and affirms traditional conceptions of masculinity/femininity, leading to its climax, in which our new Mother and Father essentially mourn the loss of their gay kid. Then came the 1960s. 8/10  Dated, overcooked and silly in places, but also excellent, and a fascinating cultural marker. Ray's style and outlook strongly resembles Vincente Minnelli's work during this period. Worth two viewings.

    Rebel Without A Cause is a great movie with a very good storyline that was probably very risky for the fifties and a very impressive cast,especially from the great James Dean in one of his most famous performances.The movie is very enjoyable and very easy to watch,although I did feel with that story that it could have been more exciting and thrilling,it was actually a lot more plain than its title may suggest.The best part of the movie was without a doubt James Dean,his performance was very inspired,he was clearly an amazing actor that died too young,his character was very creepy,brave and also lovable in a weird way,also Natalie Wood and Sam Mineo gave very impressive performances.The movie is definitely a must see for fans of this classic era of film. The son of an overhearing mother and a withdrawn father copes with the world through violence and alcohol.

    There is a more compelling sub-text running throughout than the accepted, facile storyline of rebellious teenagers suffering growing pains. There is nothing rebellious about this movie; it conforms and confirms cultural norms of the era. It's really about gender identity and how roles of men and women were defined in 1950s America. And, uh, well, back to "poop," James Dean's performance is over-wrought and self- indulgent. He emotes throughout the movie like a recently toilet trained teenager who can't hold anything incrying, moaning, bemoaning his life. His father, played effectively by Jim Backus, is an emasculated figure who tidies up the house wearing a ruffled apron. This poor specimen of a father figure is overridden and browbeaten by his supercilious, strident wife. The father is apparently not a "real man." He defers to his wife and lacks the courage to wear the pants in his own family. Jim is disappointed and ashamed of this role model of manhood. In this film masculine translates into bully with a knife, teen boys who group together challenging each other in dangerous games proving masculine supremacy. These are their self-defined "kicks," of which the "chickie run" proves fatal for Bud, the acknowledged king of the roost. Before the game's commencement the two opponents Jim and Bud face off positioned in their respective cars. Bud salutes his rival Jim christening him "toreador." Yah, this is it two bulls in the bullring locking horns in man-to-man combat. Natalie Wood, as Judy, is tormented by what she perceives is her father's withdrawal of love for her. The 16 year old craves his attention, which has lessened as she has matured. He smears off her lipstick, calls her a tramp. He is repulsed by her daughterly hugs and kisses she's now too old for that stuff. His discomfort with her demonstrative affection could more reasonably be affixed to a darker origin. Maybe Daddy is suppressing a taboo sexual desire for his own flesh and blood? Could it be?! Suppression is no stranger to Sal Mineo's character, Plato, a troubled gay kid, neglected by his parents, in frustration gunning down puppies and pining for the actor Alan Ladd whose photo he has pasted on the door of his school locker. But his desire for the man in the photo is displaced to his new friend Jim whom he stalks with devoted idolatry. All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word "rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers. They had the savvy to know they were offering a mislabeled dish to the public. They used a catchword that would entice an audience who were craving more representations of the still novel, media dubbed: Teenagers of the Rock 'n Roll Generation.

    Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' is a dramatic, teen movie from the 50's that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. There's no one clear message that's sent through this movie about these kid's lives or their families, which I think attributes to its ever-lasting value. This was a film that was made inbetween times of war, and really there was nothing about society to rebel against, hence the name "Rebel Without a Cause". Instead this movie focuses more on home matters and families, particularly through the eyes of the younger generation. These kids all seem to have something to prove to one another, and all want to be a part some group. Jim gets harassed by some punk kids, who manage get under his skin and drive him to do some dangerous things. Judy wants to be loved by her father, but her father doesn't feel inclined to show it. And Plato intends to find the family that he never had. If there was one message I could get out of this movie, it's finding your right place. Unfortunately not everybody ends up in the most perfect situation, but it is their own actions and intentions that lead them there. There was quite a bit of interesting symbolism I found in this movie as well. One scene Judy returns home after a fight with her father and is quickly greeted by her little brother, who hugs her and calls her all the names her father wouldn't call her, which to me shows the love between siblings the younger generation. Also, as mentioned before, the scene where Jim, Judy and Plato all hideaway in the abandoned mansion was one of the more heartwarming moments of the movie. This was one of my most favorite scenes in the movie, and I think told the most about the moral of the story. What these kids want is to be loved. And while it can't seem to work with their own dysfunctional families, they seek to find love in the form of starting their own.

    You will remember how Fonzie said that in an episode of "Happy Days" - he had a photo of James Dean in his locker, similar to the way Plato has a photo of Alan Ladd in his locker. This film sums up American society in the middle of the Fifties. I often feel that the Fifties are unfairly maligned - the Forties are all about the Second World War and the Swinging Sixties are the pop culture at its height. The Fifties are often dismissed as "that boring decade in between." Nothing could be further from the truth. To me, the Fifties was the decade when our modern world was born - the "counter-culture" started then, not in the Sixties. James Dean still seems like a modern young dude. So many powerful scenes in "Rebel" prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both said in interviews many years later how much they idolised Jimmy and what an influence on their acting careers he had. So many young actors have said the same in the decades since. There is no doubt this film is dated but yet that doesn't matter at all. Watching it is still a pure pleasure, thanks to Dean's performance. It deserves its legendary status and Jimmy's image will live forever because of it. There is not too much more that can be said that other reviewers haven't already said about this great film. For anyone in that difficult decade between the ages of 15 and 25, when you're struggling to transition from childhood to adulthood, it is a film you will instantly identify with. Bravo to the three young stars and to director Nicholas Ray. They all did a superb job, with Jimmy truly outstanding.

I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today.The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is excellent. James Dean is simply brilliant and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is excellent and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest. Wood has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is great as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well. Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray. Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score. In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Look. I do not hate this movie even though I gave it 1 star. But here is why I did give it one star: It was a Friday in my Visual Arts 11 class as we got to watch this film Rebel Without a Cause with one of the most famous actors of all time. I enjoyed it...... at first. But, I noticed something, this movie is the story of angst, abuse and horrible people. This movie could be the most emotionally challenging film ever made. The way the dad abuses the girl, the way the parents fight all the time, the way that they don't care about anyone, the fact that they hate everything and everyone made me wonder If this was what my life had come to. If I was born to suffer through this, then congratulations, you definitely did it. I don't know why I would want to live in a world where this is considered "Entertainment." I cried for a long time. I never did finish watching this film. I never will. This movie played with my emotions and I nearly jumped out of a window. If you are autistic, have abusive parents, or have divorced parents or if you are just soft hearted, do not watch it. Stay away from it as far as you can. If you ever come across this movie, do not buy or rent it or download it from a torrent. You might regret it. I do not hate this film in any way. I only gave this a 1 because I felt my life was pathetic and worthless after watching half of this. No Rating.

    Nicholas Ray's "Rebel Without A Cause" stars James Dean as Jim Stark, a young man who clashes with his parents and classmates. Dean would die in a car accident four weeks prior to the film's release, lending a mythic resonance to his portrayal of a troubled teenager. A companion-piece to Ray's "Bigger Than Life" (1956), "Rebel Without A Cause" (1955) share's the latter film's voluptuous qualities. Ray's colours zap the eyes-balls, his emotions grand, his music pounding, the film's melodrama unashamedly bombastic. Elsewhere Ray's favourite preoccupations pop up: the existential malaise simmering beneath 1950s suburbia, castrated males who wish to affirm themselves, striking uses of the colour red (recalling his "Johnny Guitar"), lonely characters who find each other etc etc. Amplifying the film's alienation are Ray's sets, which include an abandoned mansion and a vast planetarium, in which lecturers speak of man's insignificance even as teens jostle for attention and adoration. Ray's films are oft about sensitive loners. Here he gives us three characters  Jim, Judy and Plato  who must negotiate strained familial circumstances. Plato's without parents, Judy's shown little affection by her dad and Jim views his father, who is unwilling to stand up to an overbearing wife, as being emasculated. All three struggle with prescribed gender roles, until the film ends with a climax in which the trio mix strength and sensitivity to form their own working family unit. The film's attempts at psychoanalysis are at times clunky. Plato's homosexual, a fact which he attempts to mask with violent masculinity. Jim's straight, but similarly displaced. "If only I belonged some place," he says, "some place where I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed!" Judy's likewise struggling with acceptance. On the cusp of womanhood, but still a child, she mimics everyone around her in an attempt to fit in. Despair and a longing for connection are traits common in Ray's films. That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism ("Man, existing alone, is of little consequence," one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of "Rebel" was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women. "Rebel Without a Cause" is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" predate it by almost a decade. "The Wild One" and "The Blackboard Jungle" beat "Rebel" by a few years as well. What's true is that "Rebel's" the first of a certain type of "teen problem picture". It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later. James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in "Rebel" has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult. After "In A Lonely Place", "Rebel Without A Cause" is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film. But though Ray's direction and camera work are strong throughout, the film's thin in a number of areas, particularly in its handling of Jim's parents. Ironically for a film about "rebelling", our cast's thoroughly conformist. They all want to fit in, to be embraced, and white heterosexual romance is the order of the day. "Rebel" has been accused by many critics of being sexist (an overbearing mother seems to be the cause of Jim's troubles) and of boosting the idea of traditional masculinity as being a necessity (Jim and Plato have emasculated or absent fathers), but Ray seems to be saying something else entirely. He asks what, exactly, is the definition of a man, and by what standards should a man be defined (breadwinner, leader, hunter etc). In this regard, the film both denounces and affirms traditional conceptions of masculinity/femininity, leading to its climax, in which our new Mother and Father essentially mourn the loss of their gay kid. Then came the 1960s. 8/10  Dated, overcooked and silly in places, but also excellent, and a fascinating cultural marker. Ray's style and outlook strongly resembles Vincente Minnelli's work during this period. Worth two viewings.

    Rebel Without A Cause is a great movie with a very good storyline that was probably very risky for the fifties and a very impressive cast,especially from the great James Dean in one of his most famous performances.The movie is very enjoyable and very easy to watch,although I did feel with that story that it could have been more exciting and thrilling,it was actually a lot more plain than its title may suggest.The best part of the movie was without a doubt James Dean,his performance was very inspired,he was clearly an amazing actor that died too young,his character was very creepy,brave and also lovable in a weird way,also Natalie Wood and Sam Mineo gave very impressive performances.The movie is definitely a must see for fans of this classic era of film. The son of an overhearing mother and a withdrawn father copes with the world through violence and alcohol.

    There is a more compelling sub-text running throughout than the accepted, facile storyline of rebellious teenagers suffering growing pains. There is nothing rebellious about this movie; it conforms and confirms cultural norms of the era. It's really about gender identity and how roles of men and women were defined in 1950s America. And, uh, well, back to "poop," James Dean's performance is over-wrought and self- indulgent. He emotes throughout the movie like a recently toilet trained teenager who can't hold anything incrying, moaning, bemoaning his life. His father, played effectively by Jim Backus, is an emasculated figure who tidies up the house wearing a ruffled apron. This poor specimen of a father figure is overridden and browbeaten by his supercilious, strident wife. The father is apparently not a "real man." He defers to his wife and lacks the courage to wear the pants in his own family. Jim is disappointed and ashamed of this role model of manhood. In this film masculine translates into bully with a knife, teen boys who group together challenging each other in dangerous games proving masculine supremacy. These are their self-defined "kicks," of which the "chickie run" proves fatal for Bud, the acknowledged king of the roost. Before the game's commencement the two opponents Jim and Bud face off positioned in their respective cars. Bud salutes his rival Jim christening him "toreador." Yah, this is it two bulls in the bullring locking horns in man-to-man combat. Natalie Wood, as Judy, is tormented by what she perceives is her father's withdrawal of love for her. The 16 year old craves his attention, which has lessened as she has matured. He smears off her lipstick, calls her a tramp. He is repulsed by her daughterly hugs and kisses she's now too old for that stuff. His discomfort with her demonstrative affection could more reasonably be affixed to a darker origin. Maybe Daddy is suppressing a taboo sexual desire for his own flesh and blood? Could it be?! Suppression is no stranger to Sal Mineo's character, Plato, a troubled gay kid, neglected by his parents, in frustration gunning down puppies and pining for the actor Alan Ladd whose photo he has pasted on the door of his school locker. But his desire for the man in the photo is displaced to his new friend Jim whom he stalks with devoted idolatry. All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word "rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers. They had the savvy to know they were offering a mislabeled dish to the public. They used a catchword that would entice an audience who were craving more representations of the still novel, media dubbed: Teenagers of the Rock 'n Roll Generation.

    Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' is a dramatic, teen movie from the 50's that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. There's no one clear message that's sent through this movie about these kid's lives or their families, which I think attributes to its ever-lasting value. This was a film that was made inbetween times of war, and really there was nothing about society to rebel against, hence the name "Rebel Without a Cause". Instead this movie focuses more on home matters and families, particularly through the eyes of the younger generation. These kids all seem to have something to prove to one another, and all want to be a part some group. Jim gets harassed by some punk kids, who manage get under his skin and drive him to do some dangerous things. Judy wants to be loved by her father, but her father doesn't feel inclined to show it. And Plato intends to find the family that he never had. If there was one message I could get out of this movie, it's finding your right place. Unfortunately not everybody ends up in the most perfect situation, but it is their own actions and intentions that lead them there. There was quite a bit of interesting symbolism I found in this movie as well. One scene Judy returns home after a fight with her father and is quickly greeted by her little brother, who hugs her and calls her all the names her father wouldn't call her, which to me shows the love between siblings the younger generation. Also, as mentioned before, the scene where Jim, Judy and Plato all hideaway in the abandoned mansion was one of the more heartwarming moments of the movie. This was one of my most favorite scenes in the movie, and I think told the most about the moral of the story. What these kids want is to be loved. And while it can't seem to work with their own dysfunctional families, they seek to find love in the form of starting their own.

    You will remember how Fonzie said that in an episode of "Happy Days" - he had a photo of James Dean in his locker, similar to the way Plato has a photo of Alan Ladd in his locker. This film sums up American society in the middle of the Fifties. I often feel that the Fifties are unfairly maligned - the Forties are all about the Second World War and the Swinging Sixties are the pop culture at its height. The Fifties are often dismissed as "that boring decade in between." Nothing could be further from the truth. To me, the Fifties was the decade when our modern world was born - the "counter-culture" started then, not in the Sixties. James Dean still seems like a modern young dude. So many powerful scenes in "Rebel" prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both said in interviews many years later how much they idolised Jimmy and what an influence on their acting careers he had. So many young actors have said the same in the decades since. There is no doubt this film is dated but yet that doesn't matter at all. Watching it is still a pure pleasure, thanks to Dean's performance. It deserves its legendary status and Jimmy's image will live forever because of it. There is not too much more that can be said that other reviewers haven't already said about this great film. For anyone in that difficult decade between the ages of 15 and 25, when you're struggling to transition from childhood to adulthood, it is a film you will instantly identify with. Bravo to the three young stars and to director Nicholas Ray. They all did a superb job, with Jimmy truly outstanding.

    I had high expectations for this "classic" and was sorely disappointed. The good: Nice to see some not-over-the-top fight/scuffle scenes (in today's movies the fight scenes usually involve each participant receiving at least a dozen lethal blows). Nice to see some familiar faces (Maria, Thurston Howell, The Chief) in their (relative) youth. These tiny saving graces are greatly overwhelmed by the bad: Ridiculous, unconvincing plot. Bad dialog. Caricaturesque characters. I can forgive the movie for not having stood the test of time (few movies from the 50s do), but hard to believe it was even considered a good movie at the time. I can only attribute the stratospheric stature of the film to the untimely death of James Dean. Purple Haze would have been a great song had Hendrix not died... but Rebel Without A Cause would be as forgotten as Curtain Call at Cactus Creek had James Dean lived to be 90. Or maybe even 30.

    So much has been written on this seminal film in the last fifty years that it seems rather superfluous to add to the mix. Nevertheless, despite some of its qualities striking contemporary audiences as decidedly old-fashioned and dated, this remains a film of remarkable familiarity to today's society. Whether intended or not, what Nicholas Ray has accomplished here is telling a story about themes which transcend all generations and eras: in this sense, it is a universal story. James Dean remains an iconic figure in today's culture thanks in large part to this film. He has become the embodiment of the restless, conflicted youth attempting to understand his own place in the world while trying to reconcile the growing disparity between himself and his parents. Indeed, it is quite obvious that parent-child relationship issues are at the heart of this film, though unique for its time in the fact that this story emphasizes all three youths come from "good" families; good in the sense that they are affluent, somewhat grounded and stable despite what lies beneath the surface. Loneliness and alienation permeate throughout the entire film and Ray uses his mastery of framing and color to emphasize these themes. He also portrays Jim, Judy and Plato as the fantastical ideal family, most evident in the scene in the abandoned mansion. Unable to deal with the worlds they dwell in, these youths form their own, which is soon to be invaded and attacked. Despite this seemingly silly material, Ray transcends it with his dynamic camera work and sympathetic eye. His legacy is one centered on looking at such characters with enduring empathy and this is his most famous example. Does it hold up a half century later? Some would challenge that thought, but it is important to note that whatever modern day viewers may think of the more dated elements of this film, the impact it had on its own time and the subsequent generations remains intact. It has found a special place within our memories, which may very well be all that Nicholas Ray wanted.

    Rebel Without A Cause is simply a classic and not only one of the greatest teen films ever made,but one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with Brilliant performances from James Dean,Natalie Wood,Sal Mineo and the rest of the cast,great direction and writing,Rebel Without A Cause is one of the all time great classics of cinema and is one of my favorite films. Set in Los Angeles,California in 1955,Rebel Without A Cause tells the story of a troubled teen named Jim Stark(James Dean)who is a good kid,but is always getting into trouble making Jim and his parents moving to different cities. While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager. Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic "chickie run" all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today.The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is excellent. James Dean is simply brilliant and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is excellent and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest. Wood has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is great as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well. Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray. Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score. In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    Nicholas Ray's "Rebel Without A Cause" stars James Dean as Jim Stark, a young man who clashes with his parents and classmates. Dean would die in a car accident four weeks prior to the film's release, lending a mythic resonance to his portrayal of a troubled teenager. A companion-piece to Ray's "Bigger Than Life" (1956), "Rebel Without A Cause" (1955) share's the latter film's voluptuous qualities. Ray's colours zap the eyes-balls, his emotions grand, his music pounding, the film's melodrama unashamedly bombastic. Elsewhere Ray's favourite preoccupations pop up: the existential malaise simmering beneath 1950s suburbia, castrated males who wish to affirm themselves, striking uses of the colour red (recalling his "Johnny Guitar"), lonely characters who find each other etc etc. Amplifying the film's alienation are Ray's sets, which include an abandoned mansion and a vast planetarium, in which lecturers speak of man's insignificance even as teens jostle for attention and adoration. Ray's films are oft about sensitive loners. Here he gives us three characters  Jim, Judy and Plato  who must negotiate strained familial circumstances. Plato's without parents, Judy's shown little affection by her dad and Jim views his father, who is unwilling to stand up to an overbearing wife, as being emasculated. All three struggle with prescribed gender roles, until the film ends with a climax in which the trio mix strength and sensitivity to form their own working family unit. The film's attempts at psychoanalysis are at times clunky. Plato's homosexual, a fact which he attempts to mask with violent masculinity. Jim's straight, but similarly displaced. "If only I belonged some place," he says, "some place where I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed!" Judy's likewise struggling with acceptance. On the cusp of womanhood, but still a child, she mimics everyone around her in an attempt to fit in. Despair and a longing for connection are traits common in Ray's films. That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism ("Man, existing alone, is of little consequence," one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of "Rebel" was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women. "Rebel Without a Cause" is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" predate it by almost a decade. "The Wild One" and "The Blackboard Jungle" beat "Rebel" by a few years as well. What's true is that "Rebel's" the first of a certain type of "teen problem picture". It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later. James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in "Rebel" has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult. After "In A Lonely Place", "Rebel Without A Cause" is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film. But though Ray's direction and camera work are strong throughout, the film's thin in a number of areas, particularly in its handling of Jim's parents. Ironically for a film about "rebelling", our cast's thoroughly conformist. They all want to fit in, to be embraced, and white heterosexual romance is the order of the day. "Rebel" has been accused by many critics of being sexist (an overbearing mother seems to be the cause of Jim's troubles) and of boosting the idea of traditional masculinity as being a necessity (Jim and Plato have emasculated or absent fathers), but Ray seems to be saying something else entirely. He asks what, exactly, is the definition of a man, and by what standards should a man be defined (breadwinner, leader, hunter etc). In this regard, the film both denounces and affirms traditional conceptions of masculinity/femininity, leading to its climax, in which our new Mother and Father essentially mourn the loss of their gay kid. Then came the 1960s. 8/10  Dated, overcooked and silly in places, but also excellent, and a fascinating cultural marker. Ray's style and outlook strongly resembles Vincente Minnelli's work during this period. Worth two viewings.

    Rebel Without A Cause is a great movie with a very good storyline that was probably very risky for the fifties and a very impressive cast,especially from the great James Dean in one of his most famous performances.The movie is very enjoyable and very easy to watch,although I did feel with that story that it could have been more exciting and thrilling,it was actually a lot more plain than its title may suggest.The best part of the movie was without a doubt James Dean,his performance was very inspired,he was clearly an amazing actor that died too young,his character was very creepy,brave and also lovable in a weird way,also Natalie Wood and Sam Mineo gave very impressive performances.The movie is definitely a must see for fans of this classic era of film. The son of an overhearing mother and a withdrawn father copes with the world through violence and alcohol.

    There is a more compelling sub-text running throughout than the accepted, facile storyline of rebellious teenagers suffering growing pains. There is nothing rebellious about this movie; it conforms and confirms cultural norms of the era. It's really about gender identity and how roles of men and women were defined in 1950s America. And, uh, well, back to "poop," James Dean's performance is over-wrought and self- indulgent. He emotes throughout the movie like a recently toilet trained teenager who can't hold anything incrying, moaning, bemoaning his life. His father, played effectively by Jim Backus, is an emasculated figure who tidies up the house wearing a ruffled apron. This poor specimen of a father figure is overridden and browbeaten by his supercilious, strident wife. The father is apparently not a "real man." He defers to his wife and lacks the courage to wear the pants in his own family. Jim is disappointed and ashamed of this role model of manhood. In this film masculine translates into bully with a knife, teen boys who group together challenging each other in dangerous games proving masculine supremacy. These are their self-defined "kicks," of which the "chickie run" proves fatal for Bud, the acknowledged king of the roost. Before the game's commencement the two opponents Jim and Bud face off positioned in their respective cars. Bud salutes his rival Jim christening him "toreador." Yah, this is it two bulls in the bullring locking horns in man-to-man combat. Natalie Wood, as Judy, is tormented by what she perceives is her father's withdrawal of love for her. The 16 year old craves his attention, which has lessened as she has matured. He smears off her lipstick, calls her a tramp. He is repulsed by her daughterly hugs and kisses she's now too old for that stuff. His discomfort with her demonstrative affection could more reasonably be affixed to a darker origin. Maybe Daddy is suppressing a taboo sexual desire for his own flesh and blood? Could it be?! Suppression is no stranger to Sal Mineo's character, Plato, a troubled gay kid, neglected by his parents, in frustration gunning down puppies and pining for the actor Alan Ladd whose photo he has pasted on the door of his school locker. But his desire for the man in the photo is displaced to his new friend Jim whom he stalks with devoted idolatry. All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word "rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers. They had the savvy to know they were offering a mislabeled dish to the public. They used a catchword that would entice an audience who were craving more representations of the still novel, media dubbed: Teenagers of the Rock 'n Roll Generation.

    Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' is a dramatic, teen movie from the 50's that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. There's no one clear message that's sent through this movie about these kid's lives or their families, which I think attributes to its ever-lasting value. This was a film that was made inbetween times of war, and really there was nothing about society to rebel against, hence the name "Rebel Without a Cause". Instead this movie focuses more on home matters and families, particularly through the eyes of the younger generation. These kids all seem to have something to prove to one another, and all want to be a part some group. Jim gets harassed by some punk kids, who manage get under his skin and drive him to do some dangerous things. Judy wants to be loved by her father, but her father doesn't feel inclined to show it. And Plato intends to find the family that he never had. If there was one message I could get out of this movie, it's finding your right place. Unfortunately not everybody ends up in the most perfect situation, but it is their own actions and intentions that lead them there. There was quite a bit of interesting symbolism I found in this movie as well. One scene Judy returns home after a fight with her father and is quickly greeted by her little brother, who hugs her and calls her all the names her father wouldn't call her, which to me shows the love between siblings the younger generation. Also, as mentioned before, the scene where Jim, Judy and Plato all hideaway in the abandoned mansion was one of the more heartwarming moments of the movie. This was one of my most favorite scenes in the movie, and I think told the most about the moral of the story. What these kids want is to be loved. And while it can't seem to work with their own dysfunctional families, they seek to find love in the form of starting their own.

    You will remember how Fonzie said that in an episode of "Happy Days" - he had a photo of James Dean in his locker, similar to the way Plato has a photo of Alan Ladd in his locker. This film sums up American society in the middle of the Fifties. I often feel that the Fifties are unfairly maligned - the Forties are all about the Second World War and the Swinging Sixties are the pop culture at its height. The Fifties are often dismissed as "that boring decade in between." Nothing could be further from the truth. To me, the Fifties was the decade when our modern world was born - the "counter-culture" started then, not in the Sixties. James Dean still seems like a modern young dude. So many powerful scenes in "Rebel" prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both said in interviews many years later how much they idolised Jimmy and what an influence on their acting careers he had. So many young actors have said the same in the decades since. There is no doubt this film is dated but yet that doesn't matter at all. Watching it is still a pure pleasure, thanks to Dean's performance. It deserves its legendary status and Jimmy's image will live forever because of it. There is not too much more that can be said that other reviewers haven't already said about this great film. For anyone in that difficult decade between the ages of 15 and 25, when you're struggling to transition from childhood to adulthood, it is a film you will instantly identify with. Bravo to the three young stars and to director Nicholas Ray. They all did a superb job, with Jimmy truly outstanding.

    I had high expectations for this "classic" and was sorely disappointed. The good: Nice to see some not-over-the-top fight/scuffle scenes (in today's movies the fight scenes usually involve each participant receiving at least a dozen lethal blows). Nice to see some familiar faces (Maria, Thurston Howell, The Chief) in their (relative) youth. These tiny saving graces are greatly overwhelmed by the bad: Ridiculous, unconvincing plot. Bad dialog. Caricaturesque characters. I can forgive the movie for not having stood the test of time (few movies from the 50s do), but hard to believe it was even considered a good movie at the time. I can only attribute the stratospheric stature of the film to the untimely death of James Dean. Purple Haze would have been a great song had Hendrix not died... but Rebel Without A Cause would be as forgotten as Curtain Call at Cactus Creek had James Dean lived to be 90. Or maybe even 30.

    So much has been written on this seminal film in the last fifty years that it seems rather superfluous to add to the mix. Nevertheless, despite some of its qualities striking contemporary audiences as decidedly old-fashioned and dated, this remains a film of remarkable familiarity to today's society. Whether intended or not, what Nicholas Ray has accomplished here is telling a story about themes which transcend all generations and eras: in this sense, it is a universal story. James Dean remains an iconic figure in today's culture thanks in large part to this film. He has become the embodiment of the restless, conflicted youth attempting to understand his own place in the world while trying to reconcile the growing disparity between himself and his parents. Indeed, it is quite obvious that parent-child relationship issues are at the heart of this film, though unique for its time in the fact that this story emphasizes all three youths come from "good" families; good in the sense that they are affluent, somewhat grounded and stable despite what lies beneath the surface. Loneliness and alienation permeate throughout the entire film and Ray uses his mastery of framing and color to emphasize these themes. He also portrays Jim, Judy and Plato as the fantastical ideal family, most evident in the scene in the abandoned mansion. Unable to deal with the worlds they dwell in, these youths form their own, which is soon to be invaded and attacked. Despite this seemingly silly material, Ray transcends it with his dynamic camera work and sympathetic eye. His legacy is one centered on looking at such characters with enduring empathy and this is his most famous example. Does it hold up a half century later? Some would challenge that thought, but it is important to note that whatever modern day viewers may think of the more dated elements of this film, the impact it had on its own time and the subsequent generations remains intact. It has found a special place within our memories, which may very well be all that Nicholas Ray wanted.

    One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made With A Brilliant Performance From James Dean.

    Rebel Without A Cause is simply a classic and not only one of the greatest teen films ever made,but one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with Brilliant performances from James Dean,Natalie Wood,Sal Mineo and the rest of the cast,great direction and writing,Rebel Without A Cause is one of the all time great classics of cinema and is one of my favorite films. Set in Los Angeles,California in 1955,Rebel Without A Cause tells the story of a troubled teen named Jim Stark(James Dean)who is a good kid,but is always getting into trouble making Jim and his parents moving to different cities. While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager. Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic "chickie run" all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today.The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is excellent. James Dean is simply brilliant and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is excellent and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest. Wood has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is great as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well. Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray. Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score. In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    i am a English movie fan but haven't watched much of old films. my range is mostly movies from late 90s till date. rarely i watch movies of 50s to 70s with proper ratings and all other researching. but this film caught me when i was completely open. i have a theory that 1999 was the best year for Hollywood as many of my favorites, all time favorites, long term no 1 movies are from this year containing matrix and fight club which changed my life forever. when i watched fight club on and half years back after that no movie moved me like this one. i was so much moved by it that no other movie seems to had similar effect on me. obviously every time after watching a good movie failing to touch me deep inside i researched for movie similar to fight club. recently while checking Wikipedia of fight club i found this movie many people found similar to fight club. i downloaded it without checking anything and saw. this will never replace fight club for me but now this movie has its own place. what a timeless masterpiece. as down looking as fight club and high on content and acting at the same time. hardly we find movies this entertaining made on social issues of particular time. time to meet fathers of film making. 50s let me see what you have.

    Look. I do not hate this movie even though I gave it 1 star. But here is why I did give it one star: It was a Friday in my Visual Arts 11 class as we got to watch this film Rebel Without a Cause with one of the most famous actors of all time. I enjoyed it...... at first. But, I noticed something, this movie is the story of angst, abuse and horrible people. This movie could be the most emotionally challenging film ever made. The way the dad abuses the girl, the way the parents fight all the time, the way that they don't care about anyone, the fact that they hate everything and everyone made me wonder If this was what my life had come to. If I was born to suffer through this, then congratulations, you definitely did it. I don't know why I would want to live in a world where this is considered "Entertainment." I cried for a long time. I never did finish watching this film. I never will. This movie played with my emotions and I nearly jumped out of a window. If you are autistic, have abusive parents, or have divorced parents or if you are just soft hearted, do not watch it. Stay away from it as far as you can. If you ever come across this movie, do not buy or rent it or download it from a torrent. You might regret it. I do not hate this film in any way. I only gave this a 1 because I felt my life was pathetic and worthless after watching half of this. No Rating.

In this regard, the film both denounces and affirms traditional conceptions of masculinity/femininity, leading to its climax, in which our new Mother and Father essentially mourn the loss of their gay kid. Then came the 1960s. 8/10  Dated, overcooked and silly in places, but also excellent, and a fascinating cultural marker. Ray's style and outlook strongly resembles Vincente Minnelli's work during this period. Worth two viewings.

The son of an overhearing mother and a withdrawn father copes with the world through violence and alcohol.

    There is a more compelling sub-text running throughout than the accepted, facile storyline of rebellious teenagers suffering growing pains. There is nothing rebellious about this movie; it conforms and confirms cultural norms of the era. It's really about gender identity and how roles of men and women were defined in 1950s America. And, uh, well, back to "poop," James Dean's performance is over-wrought and self- indulgent. He emotes throughout the movie like a recently toilet trained teenager who can't hold anything incrying, moaning, bemoaning his life. His father, played effectively by Jim Backus, is an emasculated figure who tidies up the house wearing a ruffled apron. This poor specimen of a father figure is overridden and browbeaten by his supercilious, strident wife. The father is apparently not a "real man." He defers to his wife and lacks the courage to wear the pants in his own family. Jim is disappointed and ashamed of this role model of manhood. In this film masculine translates into bully with a knife, teen boys who group together challenging each other in dangerous games proving masculine supremacy. These are their self-defined "kicks," of which the "chickie run" proves fatal for Bud, the acknowledged king of the roost. Before the game's commencement the two opponents Jim and Bud face off positioned in their respective cars. Bud salutes his rival Jim christening him "toreador." Yah, this is it two bulls in the bullring locking horns in man-to-man combat. Natalie Wood, as Judy, is tormented by what she perceives is her father's withdrawal of love for her. The 16 year old craves his attention, which has lessened as she has matured. He smears off her lipstick, calls her a tramp. He is repulsed by her daughterly hugs and kisses she's now too old for that stuff. His discomfort with her demonstrative affection could more reasonably be affixed to a darker origin. Maybe Daddy is suppressing a taboo sexual desire for his own flesh and blood? Could it be?! Suppression is no stranger to Sal Mineo's character, Plato, a troubled gay kid, neglected by his parents, in frustration gunning down puppies and pining for the actor Alan Ladd whose photo he has pasted on the door of his school locker. But his desire for the man in the photo is displaced to his new friend Jim whom he stalks with devoted idolatry. All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word "rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers. They had the savvy to know they were offering a mislabeled dish to the public. They used a catchword that would entice an audience who were craving more representations of the still novel, media dubbed: Teenagers of the Rock 'n Roll Generation.

    Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' is a dramatic, teen movie from the 50's that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. There's no one clear message that's sent through this movie about these kid's lives or their families, which I think attributes to its ever-lasting value. This was a film that was made inbetween times of war, and really there was nothing about society to rebel against, hence the name "Rebel Without a Cause". Instead this movie focuses more on home matters and families, particularly through the eyes of the younger generation. These kids all seem to have something to prove to one another, and all want to be a part some group. Jim gets harassed by some punk kids, who manage get under his skin and drive him to do some dangerous things. Judy wants to be loved by her father, but her father doesn't feel inclined to show it. And Plato intends to find the family that he never had. If there was one message I could get out of this movie, it's finding your right place. Unfortunately not everybody ends up in the most perfect situation, but it is their own actions and intentions that lead them there. There was quite a bit of interesting symbolism I found in this movie as well. One scene Judy returns home after a fight with her father and is quickly greeted by her little brother, who hugs her and calls her all the names her father wouldn't call her, which to me shows the love between siblings the younger generation. Also, as mentioned before, the scene where Jim, Judy and Plato all hideaway in the abandoned mansion was one of the more heartwarming moments of the movie. This was one of my most favorite scenes in the movie, and I think told the most about the moral of the story. What these kids want is to be loved. And while it can't seem to work with their own dysfunctional families, they seek to find love in the form of starting their own.

    You will remember how Fonzie said that in an episode of "Happy Days" - he had a photo of James Dean in his locker, similar to the way Plato has a photo of Alan Ladd in his locker. This film sums up American society in the middle of the Fifties. I often feel that the Fifties are unfairly maligned - the Forties are all about the Second World War and the Swinging Sixties are the pop culture at its height. The Fifties are often dismissed as "that boring decade in between." Nothing could be further from the truth. To me, the Fifties was the decade when our modern world was born - the "counter-culture" started then, not in the Sixties. James Dean still seems like a modern young dude. So many powerful scenes in "Rebel" prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both said in interviews many years later how much they idolised Jimmy and what an influence on their acting careers he had. So many young actors have said the same in the decades since. There is no doubt this film is dated but yet that doesn't matter at all. Watching it is still a pure pleasure, thanks to Dean's performance. It deserves its legendary status and Jimmy's image will live forever because of it. There is not too much more that can be said that other reviewers haven't already said about this great film. For anyone in that difficult decade between the ages of 15 and 25, when you're struggling to transition from childhood to adulthood, it is a film you will instantly identify with. Bravo to the three young stars and to director Nicholas Ray. They all did a superb job, with Jimmy truly outstanding.

    I had high expectations for this "classic" and was sorely disappointed. The good: Nice to see some not-over-the-top fight/scuffle scenes (in today's movies the fight scenes usually involve each participant receiving at least a dozen lethal blows). Nice to see some familiar faces (Maria, Thurston Howell, The Chief) in their (relative) youth. These tiny saving graces are greatly overwhelmed by the bad: Ridiculous, unconvincing plot. Bad dialog. Caricaturesque characters. I can forgive the movie for not having stood the test of time (few movies from the 50s do), but hard to believe it was even considered a good movie at the time. I can only attribute the stratospheric stature of the film to the untimely death of James Dean. Purple Haze would have been a great song had Hendrix not died... but Rebel Without A Cause would be as forgotten as Curtain Call at Cactus Creek had James Dean lived to be 90. Or maybe even 30.

    So much has been written on this seminal film in the last fifty years that it seems rather superfluous to add to the mix. Nevertheless, despite some of its qualities striking contemporary audiences as decidedly old-fashioned and dated, this remains a film of remarkable familiarity to today's society. Whether intended or not, what Nicholas Ray has accomplished here is telling a story about themes which transcend all generations and eras: in this sense, it is a universal story. James Dean remains an iconic figure in today's culture thanks in large part to this film. He has become the embodiment of the restless, conflicted youth attempting to understand his own place in the world while trying to reconcile the growing disparity between himself and his parents. Indeed, it is quite obvious that parent-child relationship issues are at the heart of this film, though unique for its time in the fact that this story emphasizes all three youths come from "good" families; good in the sense that they are affluent, somewhat grounded and stable despite what lies beneath the surface. Loneliness and alienation permeate throughout the entire film and Ray uses his mastery of framing and color to emphasize these themes. He also portrays Jim, Judy and Plato as the fantastical ideal family, most evident in the scene in the abandoned mansion. Unable to deal with the worlds they dwell in, these youths form their own, which is soon to be invaded and attacked. Despite this seemingly silly material, Ray transcends it with his dynamic camera work and sympathetic eye. His legacy is one centered on looking at such characters with enduring empathy and this is his most famous example. Does it hold up a half century later? Some would challenge that thought, but it is important to note that whatever modern day viewers may think of the more dated elements of this film, the impact it had on its own time and the subsequent generations remains intact. It has found a special place within our memories, which may very well be all that Nicholas Ray wanted.

    Rebel Without A Cause is simply a classic and not only one of the greatest teen films ever made,but one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with Brilliant performances from James Dean,Natalie Wood,Sal Mineo and the rest of the cast,great direction and writing,Rebel Without A Cause is one of the all time great classics of cinema and is one of my favorite films. Set in Los Angeles,California in 1955,Rebel Without A Cause tells the story of a troubled teen named Jim Stark(James Dean)who is a good kid,but is always getting into trouble making Jim and his parents moving to different cities. While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager. Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic "chickie run" all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today.The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is excellent. James Dean is simply brilliant and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is excellent and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest. Wood has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is great as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well. Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray. Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score. In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    i am a English movie fan but haven't watched much of old films. my range is mostly movies from late 90s till date. rarely i watch movies of 50s to 70s with proper ratings and all other researching. but this film caught me when i was completely open. i have a theory that 1999 was the best year for Hollywood as many of my favorites, all time favorites, long term no 1 movies are from this year containing matrix and fight club which changed my life forever. when i watched fight club on and half years back after that no movie moved me like this one. i was so much moved by it that no other movie seems to had similar effect on me. obviously every time after watching a good movie failing to touch me deep inside i researched for movie similar to fight club. recently while checking Wikipedia of fight club i found this movie many people found similar to fight club. i downloaded it without checking anything and saw. this will never replace fight club for me but now this movie has its own place. what a timeless masterpiece. as down looking as fight club and high on content and acting at the same time. hardly we find movies this entertaining made on social issues of particular time. time to meet fathers of film making. 50s let me see what you have.

    Look. I do not hate this movie even though I gave it 1 star. But here is why I did give it one star: It was a Friday in my Visual Arts 11 class as we got to watch this film Rebel Without a Cause with one of the most famous actors of all time. I enjoyed it...... at first. But, I noticed something, this movie is the story of angst, abuse and horrible people. This movie could be the most emotionally challenging film ever made. The way the dad abuses the girl, the way the parents fight all the time, the way that they don't care about anyone, the fact that they hate everything and everyone made me wonder If this was what my life had come to. If I was born to suffer through this, then congratulations, you definitely did it. I don't know why I would want to live in a world where this is considered "Entertainment." I cried for a long time. I never did finish watching this film. I never will. This movie played with my emotions and I nearly jumped out of a window. If you are autistic, have abusive parents, or have divorced parents or if you are just soft hearted, do not watch it. Stay away from it as far as you can. If you ever come across this movie, do not buy or rent it or download it from a torrent. You might regret it. I do not hate this film in any way. I only gave this a 1 because I felt my life was pathetic and worthless after watching half of this. No Rating.

    Nicholas Ray's "Rebel Without A Cause" stars James Dean as Jim Stark, a young man who clashes with his parents and classmates. Dean would die in a car accident four weeks prior to the film's release, lending a mythic resonance to his portrayal of a troubled teenager. A companion-piece to Ray's "Bigger Than Life" (1956), "Rebel Without A Cause" (1955) share's the latter film's voluptuous qualities. Ray's colours zap the eyes-balls, his emotions grand, his music pounding, the film's melodrama unashamedly bombastic. Elsewhere Ray's favourite preoccupations pop up: the existential malaise simmering beneath 1950s suburbia, castrated males who wish to affirm themselves, striking uses of the colour red (recalling his "Johnny Guitar"), lonely characters who find each other etc etc. Amplifying the film's alienation are Ray's sets, which include an abandoned mansion and a vast planetarium, in which lecturers speak of man's insignificance even as teens jostle for attention and adoration. Ray's films are oft about sensitive loners. Here he gives us three characters  Jim, Judy and Plato  who must negotiate strained familial circumstances. Plato's without parents, Judy's shown little affection by her dad and Jim views his father, who is unwilling to stand up to an overbearing wife, as being emasculated. All three struggle with prescribed gender roles, until the film ends with a climax in which the trio mix strength and sensitivity to form their own working family unit. The film's attempts at psychoanalysis are at times clunky. Plato's homosexual, a fact which he attempts to mask with violent masculinity. Jim's straight, but similarly displaced. "If only I belonged some place," he says, "some place where I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed!" Judy's likewise struggling with acceptance. On the cusp of womanhood, but still a child, she mimics everyone around her in an attempt to fit in. Despair and a longing for connection are traits common in Ray's films. That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism ("Man, existing alone, is of little consequence," one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of "Rebel" was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women. "Rebel Without a Cause" is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" predate it by almost a decade. "The Wild One" and "The Blackboard Jungle" beat "Rebel" by a few years as well. What's true is that "Rebel's" the first of a certain type of "teen problem picture". It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later. James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in "Rebel" has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult. After "In A Lonely Place", "Rebel Without A Cause" is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film. But though Ray's direction and camera work are strong throughout, the film's thin in a number of areas, particularly in its handling of Jim's parents. Ironically for a film about "rebelling", our cast's thoroughly conformist. They all want to fit in, to be embraced, and white heterosexual romance is the order of the day. "Rebel" has been accused by many critics of being sexist (an overbearing mother seems to be the cause of Jim's troubles) and of boosting the idea of traditional masculinity as being a necessity (Jim and Plato have emasculated or absent fathers), but Ray seems to be saying something else entirely. He asks what, exactly, is the definition of a man, and by what standards should a man be defined (breadwinner, leader, hunter etc). In this regard, the film both denounces and affirms traditional conceptions of masculinity/femininity, leading to its climax, in which our new Mother and Father essentially mourn the loss of their gay kid. Then came the 1960s. 8/10  Dated, overcooked and silly in places, but also excellent, and a fascinating cultural marker. Ray's style and outlook strongly resembles Vincente Minnelli's work during this period. Worth two viewings.

All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word "rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers.

This was one of my most favorite scenes in the movie, and I think told the most about the moral of the story. What these kids want is to be loved.

    You will remember how Fonzie said that in an episode of "Happy Days" - he had a photo of James Dean in his locker, similar to the way Plato has a photo of Alan Ladd in his locker. This film sums up American society in the middle of the Fifties. I often feel that the Fifties are unfairly maligned - the Forties are all about the Second World War and the Swinging Sixties are the pop culture at its height. The Fifties are often dismissed as "that boring decade in between." Nothing could be further from the truth. To me, the Fifties was the decade when our modern world was born - the "counter-culture" started then, not in the Sixties. James Dean still seems like a modern young dude. So many powerful scenes in "Rebel" prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both said in interviews many years later how much they idolised Jimmy and what an influence on their acting careers he had. So many young actors have said the same in the decades since. There is no doubt this film is dated but yet that doesn't matter at all. Watching it is still a pure pleasure, thanks to Dean's performance. It deserves its legendary status and Jimmy's image will live forever because of it. There is not too much more that can be said that other reviewers haven't already said about this great film. For anyone in that difficult decade between the ages of 15 and 25, when you're struggling to transition from childhood to adulthood, it is a film you will instantly identify with. Bravo to the three young stars and to director Nicholas Ray. They all did a superb job, with Jimmy truly outstanding.

    I had high expectations for this "classic" and was sorely disappointed. The good: Nice to see some not-over-the-top fight/scuffle scenes (in today's movies the fight scenes usually involve each participant receiving at least a dozen lethal blows). Nice to see some familiar faces (Maria, Thurston Howell, The Chief) in their (relative) youth. These tiny saving graces are greatly overwhelmed by the bad: Ridiculous, unconvincing plot. Bad dialog. Caricaturesque characters. I can forgive the movie for not having stood the test of time (few movies from the 50s do), but hard to believe it was even considered a good movie at the time. I can only attribute the stratospheric stature of the film to the untimely death of James Dean. Purple Haze would have been a great song had Hendrix not died... but Rebel Without A Cause would be as forgotten as Curtain Call at Cactus Creek had James Dean lived to be 90. Or maybe even 30.

    So much has been written on this seminal film in the last fifty years that it seems rather superfluous to add to the mix. Nevertheless, despite some of its qualities striking contemporary audiences as decidedly old-fashioned and dated, this remains a film of remarkable familiarity to today's society. Whether intended or not, what Nicholas Ray has accomplished here is telling a story about themes which transcend all generations and eras: in this sense, it is a universal story. James Dean remains an iconic figure in today's culture thanks in large part to this film. He has become the embodiment of the restless, conflicted youth attempting to understand his own place in the world while trying to reconcile the growing disparity between himself and his parents. Indeed, it is quite obvious that parent-child relationship issues are at the heart of this film, though unique for its time in the fact that this story emphasizes all three youths come from "good" families; good in the sense that they are affluent, somewhat grounded and stable despite what lies beneath the surface. Loneliness and alienation permeate throughout the entire film and Ray uses his mastery of framing and color to emphasize these themes. He also portrays Jim, Judy and Plato as the fantastical ideal family, most evident in the scene in the abandoned mansion. Unable to deal with the worlds they dwell in, these youths form their own, which is soon to be invaded and attacked. Despite this seemingly silly material, Ray transcends it with his dynamic camera work and sympathetic eye. His legacy is one centered on looking at such characters with enduring empathy and this is his most famous example. Does it hold up a half century later? Some would challenge that thought, but it is important to note that whatever modern day viewers may think of the more dated elements of this film, the impact it had on its own time and the subsequent generations remains intact. It has found a special place within our memories, which may very well be all that Nicholas Ray wanted.

    Rebel Without A Cause is simply a classic and not only one of the greatest teen films ever made,but one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with Brilliant performances from James Dean,Natalie Wood,Sal Mineo and the rest of the cast,great direction and writing,Rebel Without A Cause is one of the all time great classics of cinema and is one of my favorite films. Set in Los Angeles,California in 1955,Rebel Without A Cause tells the story of a troubled teen named Jim Stark(James Dean)who is a good kid,but is always getting into trouble making Jim and his parents moving to different cities. While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager. Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic "chickie run" all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today.The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is excellent. James Dean is simply brilliant and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is excellent and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest. Wood has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is great as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well. Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray. Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score. In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    i am a English movie fan but haven't watched much of old films. my range is mostly movies from late 90s till date. rarely i watch movies of 50s to 70s with proper ratings and all other researching. but this film caught me when i was completely open. i have a theory that 1999 was the best year for Hollywood as many of my favorites, all time favorites, long term no 1 movies are from this year containing matrix and fight club which changed my life forever. when i watched fight club on and half years back after that no movie moved me like this one. i was so much moved by it that no other movie seems to had similar effect on me. obviously every time after watching a good movie failing to touch me deep inside i researched for movie similar to fight club. recently while checking Wikipedia of fight club i found this movie many people found similar to fight club. i downloaded it without checking anything and saw. this will never replace fight club for me but now this movie has its own place. what a timeless masterpiece. as down looking as fight club and high on content and acting at the same time. hardly we find movies this entertaining made on social issues of particular time. time to meet fathers of film making. 50s let me see what you have.

    Look. I do not hate this movie even though I gave it 1 star. But here is why I did give it one star: It was a Friday in my Visual Arts 11 class as we got to watch this film Rebel Without a Cause with one of the most famous actors of all time. I enjoyed it...... at first. But, I noticed something, this movie is the story of angst, abuse and horrible people. This movie could be the most emotionally challenging film ever made. The way the dad abuses the girl, the way the parents fight all the time, the way that they don't care about anyone, the fact that they hate everything and everyone made me wonder If this was what my life had come to. If I was born to suffer through this, then congratulations, you definitely did it. I don't know why I would want to live in a world where this is considered "Entertainment." I cried for a long time. I never did finish watching this film. I never will. This movie played with my emotions and I nearly jumped out of a window. If you are autistic, have abusive parents, or have divorced parents or if you are just soft hearted, do not watch it. Stay away from it as far as you can. If you ever come across this movie, do not buy or rent it or download it from a torrent. You might regret it. I do not hate this film in any way. I only gave this a 1 because I felt my life was pathetic and worthless after watching half of this. No Rating.

    Nicholas Ray's "Rebel Without A Cause" stars James Dean as Jim Stark, a young man who clashes with his parents and classmates. Dean would die in a car accident four weeks prior to the film's release, lending a mythic resonance to his portrayal of a troubled teenager. A companion-piece to Ray's "Bigger Than Life" (1956), "Rebel Without A Cause" (1955) share's the latter film's voluptuous qualities. Ray's colours zap the eyes-balls, his emotions grand, his music pounding, the film's melodrama unashamedly bombastic. Elsewhere Ray's favourite preoccupations pop up: the existential malaise simmering beneath 1950s suburbia, castrated males who wish to affirm themselves, striking uses of the colour red (recalling his "Johnny Guitar"), lonely characters who find each other etc etc. Amplifying the film's alienation are Ray's sets, which include an abandoned mansion and a vast planetarium, in which lecturers speak of man's insignificance even as teens jostle for attention and adoration. Ray's films are oft about sensitive loners. Here he gives us three characters  Jim, Judy and Plato  who must negotiate strained familial circumstances. Plato's without parents, Judy's shown little affection by her dad and Jim views his father, who is unwilling to stand up to an overbearing wife, as being emasculated. All three struggle with prescribed gender roles, until the film ends with a climax in which the trio mix strength and sensitivity to form their own working family unit. The film's attempts at psychoanalysis are at times clunky. Plato's homosexual, a fact which he attempts to mask with violent masculinity. Jim's straight, but similarly displaced. "If only I belonged some place," he says, "some place where I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed!" Judy's likewise struggling with acceptance. On the cusp of womanhood, but still a child, she mimics everyone around her in an attempt to fit in. Despair and a longing for connection are traits common in Ray's films. That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism ("Man, existing alone, is of little consequence," one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of "Rebel" was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women. "Rebel Without a Cause" is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" predate it by almost a decade. "The Wild One" and "The Blackboard Jungle" beat "Rebel" by a few years as well. What's true is that "Rebel's" the first of a certain type of "teen problem picture". It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later. James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in "Rebel" has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult. After "In A Lonely Place", "Rebel Without A Cause" is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film. But though Ray's direction and camera work are strong throughout, the film's thin in a number of areas, particularly in its handling of Jim's parents. Ironically for a film about "rebelling", our cast's thoroughly conformist. They all want to fit in, to be embraced, and white heterosexual romance is the order of the day. "Rebel" has been accused by many critics of being sexist (an overbearing mother seems to be the cause of Jim's troubles) and of boosting the idea of traditional masculinity as being a necessity (Jim and Plato have emasculated or absent fathers), but Ray seems to be saying something else entirely. He asks what, exactly, is the definition of a man, and by what standards should a man be defined (breadwinner, leader, hunter etc). In this regard, the film both denounces and affirms traditional conceptions of masculinity/femininity, leading to its climax, in which our new Mother and Father essentially mourn the loss of their gay kid. Then came the 1960s. 8/10  Dated, overcooked and silly in places, but also excellent, and a fascinating cultural marker. Ray's style and outlook strongly resembles Vincente Minnelli's work during this period. Worth two viewings.

    Rebel Without A Cause is a great movie with a very good storyline that was probably very risky for the fifties and a very impressive cast,especially from the great James Dean in one of his most famous performances.The movie is very enjoyable and very easy to watch,although I did feel with that story that it could have been more exciting and thrilling,it was actually a lot more plain than its title may suggest.The best part of the movie was without a doubt James Dean,his performance was very inspired,he was clearly an amazing actor that died too young,his character was very creepy,brave and also lovable in a weird way,also Natalie Wood and Sam Mineo gave very impressive performances.The movie is definitely a must see for fans of this classic era of film. The son of an overhearing mother and a withdrawn father copes with the world through violence and alcohol.

    There is a more compelling sub-text running throughout than the accepted, facile storyline of rebellious teenagers suffering growing pains. There is nothing rebellious about this movie; it conforms and confirms cultural norms of the era. It's really about gender identity and how roles of men and women were defined in 1950s America. And, uh, well, back to "poop," James Dean's performance is over-wrought and self- indulgent. He emotes throughout the movie like a recently toilet trained teenager who can't hold anything incrying, moaning, bemoaning his life. His father, played effectively by Jim Backus, is an emasculated figure who tidies up the house wearing a ruffled apron. This poor specimen of a father figure is overridden and browbeaten by his supercilious, strident wife. The father is apparently not a "real man." He defers to his wife and lacks the courage to wear the pants in his own family. Jim is disappointed and ashamed of this role model of manhood. In this film masculine translates into bully with a knife, teen boys who group together challenging each other in dangerous games proving masculine supremacy. These are their self-defined "kicks," of which the "chickie run" proves fatal for Bud, the acknowledged king of the roost. Before the game's commencement the two opponents Jim and Bud face off positioned in their respective cars. Bud salutes his rival Jim christening him "toreador." Yah, this is it two bulls in the bullring locking horns in man-to-man combat. Natalie Wood, as Judy, is tormented by what she perceives is her father's withdrawal of love for her. The 16 year old craves his attention, which has lessened as she has matured. He smears off her lipstick, calls her a tramp. He is repulsed by her daughterly hugs and kisses she's now too old for that stuff. His discomfort with her demonstrative affection could more reasonably be affixed to a darker origin. Maybe Daddy is suppressing a taboo sexual desire for his own flesh and blood? Could it be?! Suppression is no stranger to Sal Mineo's character, Plato, a troubled gay kid, neglected by his parents, in frustration gunning down puppies and pining for the actor Alan Ladd whose photo he has pasted on the door of his school locker. But his desire for the man in the photo is displaced to his new friend Jim whom he stalks with devoted idolatry. All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word "rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers. They had the savvy to know they were offering a mislabeled dish to the public. They used a catchword that would entice an audience who were craving more representations of the still novel, media dubbed: Teenagers of the Rock 'n Roll Generation.

    Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' is a dramatic, teen movie from the 50's that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. There's no one clear message that's sent through this movie about these kid's lives or their families, which I think attributes to its ever-lasting value. This was a film that was made inbetween times of war, and really there was nothing about society to rebel against, hence the name "Rebel Without a Cause". Instead this movie focuses more on home matters and families, particularly through the eyes of the younger generation. These kids all seem to have something to prove to one another, and all want to be a part some group. Jim gets harassed by some punk kids, who manage get under his skin and drive him to do some dangerous things. Judy wants to be loved by her father, but her father doesn't feel inclined to show it. And Plato intends to find the family that he never had. If there was one message I could get out of this movie, it's finding your right place. Unfortunately not everybody ends up in the most perfect situation, but it is their own actions and intentions that lead them there. There was quite a bit of interesting symbolism I found in this movie as well. One scene Judy returns home after a fight with her father and is quickly greeted by her little brother, who hugs her and calls her all the names her father wouldn't call her, which to me shows the love between siblings the younger generation. Also, as mentioned before, the scene where Jim, Judy and Plato all hideaway in the abandoned mansion was one of the more heartwarming moments of the movie. This was one of my most favorite scenes in the movie, and I think told the most about the moral of the story. What these kids want is to be loved. And while it can't seem to work with their own dysfunctional families, they seek to find love in the form of starting their own.

While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager. Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic "chickie run" all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today.The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is excellent. James Dean is simply brilliant and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is excellent and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest. Wood has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is great as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well. Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray. Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score. In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    i am a English movie fan but haven't watched much of old films. my range is mostly movies from late 90s till date. rarely i watch movies of 50s to 70s with proper ratings and all other researching. but this film caught me when i was completely open. i have a theory that 1999 was the best year for Hollywood as many of my favorites, all time favorites, long term no 1 movies are from this year containing matrix and fight club which changed my life forever. when i watched fight club on and half years back after that no movie moved me like this one. i was so much moved by it that no other movie seems to had similar effect on me. obviously every time after watching a good movie failing to touch me deep inside i researched for movie similar to fight club. recently while checking Wikipedia of fight club i found this movie many people found similar to fight club. i downloaded it without checking anything and saw. this will never replace fight club for me but now this movie has its own place. what a timeless masterpiece. as down looking as fight club and high on content and acting at the same time. hardly we find movies this entertaining made on social issues of particular time. time to meet fathers of film making. 50s let me see what you have.
