    Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on Robert E. Howard stories trend. Because after 20 years, we'll have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on J.R.R. Tolkien stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s (such as Conan, The Beastmaster, He-Man in Masters of the Universe, and else). And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s (such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, and even Spy Kids in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi). In (Conan the Barbarian) Schwarzenegger proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie ! And this is great considering the known nature of these movies, whereas  frankly  the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic ! Generally it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the costumes are mostly reveling to assure the sex factor and  in the same time  dirty to evoke the uncivilized age which the movie takes place in. The fights are damn memorable. They were so real; remember that Schwarzenegger required many stitches and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that Sandahl Bergman had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies ! Still, the pace of the movie is one of the most interesting points in it. It isn't another action with desert adventures and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste. Speaking about the "seriousness" and "meditation" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only. It has extra with the shadows it uses to fulfill that revenge story. It's where the "sword" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the "sorcery", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this.. It's strange, or kind of bold, to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But this is the movie's substance and intellectual point of view; where barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship. You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the matter as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous, yet more powerful, man to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being "an analogy of Christ's life", "a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head" and "an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets" (??!), all made by guys think a bit too much as you see ! The cons can be felt in few elements : The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. Sandahl Bergman wasn't that sexy or beautiful. Gerry Lopez is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers. James Earl Jones's head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax. So this is a different action. Not due to the abundant sex and violence (which you can find in many other movies). But due to the high qualities, the distinct pace, and the forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind.

    In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold. Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic. Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called "The Wheel of Pain" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose. This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score. It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production. Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter "Crom!" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it. As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up. The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's "Apocalypse Now" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention. As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.

    Had heard about this for years but never got an opportunity to view it before now. Turned out to be slightly different from my expectations. It turned out not to have a well-defined plot but more a series of random incidents - at least in the beginning - which somehow lead the protagonist to the ultimate confrontation as if destiny has preordained it. There is also an emphasis on minimal dialogue which works in the film's favour by reducing clunky exposition and making it more of an action-packed visual spectacle. And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue. The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent. A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes. That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, "Crom!" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour. Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess. Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing. All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.

    Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.

    I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. I have read that some people criticize three things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no "laurence Olivier" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is precisely what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need "Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others, they are not brilliant, they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic. Some other guy said that there is "little violence" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood. The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow&iexcl;&iexcl; in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all "Black & White". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are incredibly credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic "friedrich Nietzsche" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the "Super-Human or Super-Man". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a "so speaks Zarathustra" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some "fascistoid" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.

    i usually don't review a movie unless i feel there is something that must be said. and in this movie there is something like that. do you want deep and long conversations ? yells and roars of battle ? well you came to the wrong place ! in this one they speak short and important, the rest, the viewer must know threw visual and music purely. the visuals which were not too much but not too little, always was completely synced with the exact music and sounds that led us through the movie. but when needed some 'push', a few sentences came but enough to be considered unnoticeable. this movie, which is 2 hours long with some weird sorcery and costumed fighting that most of the time make the viewer(me) unconformable and unwatchable, this one actually make us even more deep in the movie's experience, no matter the age. with this new age of extremely developed CGI technology, there is no need in casting 100 people for a ceremony and action scenes will be much more faster stronger, but they will always miss something that i find very important, sometimes much stronger than the use of CGI, REALITY.

    Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, "Conan the Barbarian" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. "Conan the Barbarian" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel. But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle. 5.5/10

    Directed by John Milius, "Conan the Barbarian" is an exaltation of all things barbaric. Some context: Milius is mostly known today for being the basis of Walter Sobchak, the gun-loving right-winger of the Coen Brothers' "Big Lebowski". There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his "hard-right politics", which he lovingly equates with "rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo". Milius' films ("Big Wednesday", "Magnum Force", "Dilinger", "Conan", "Red Dawn" etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing "Dirty Harry", Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because "guns are more honourable than money". "Conan" was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote "Apocalypse Now") salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance. Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. "Conan" doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' "everyman warriors" vs "the evil Other who steals our Freedom" tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist "Private Ryan"). Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - "That which does not kill us makes us stronger" - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of "the will to power", the expression of human existence superior to that of the "conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority". Nietzsche "attacks man's moral principles" such that "the new superman is a law unto himself". He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who "builds himself up into a being beyond the mob". "His secret nobility," Nietzsche then says, "will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists". The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne. So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's "mind and flesh are greater than steel", Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness. Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity  gratuitous in another picture  only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled "Theology/Civilization", has itself become well known in concert circuits. Like "Star Wars" (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy/mythological film which preceded it, "Conan" is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman  who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior  a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells "Conan, what is best in life?", Arnie responds like a caveman: "To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women!" Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - "Do you want to live forever?!" - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies. The film was followed by a worthless sequel. "Conan" itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain. Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was "Red Dawn", essentially Conan with kids. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Arnold has entertained me in many movies over the years (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, Collateral Damage, Eraser), so I can forgive his pitiful acting in this film and just sit back and enjoy it. Of course, the best thing about the film was the presence of Sandahl Bergman, originally a Golddigger from "The Dean Martin Show". She can act and did a very good job of it. I also enjoyed Mako (The Sand Pebbles) and Gerry Lopez, who I guess gave up acting for surfing. It is just a plain guilty pleasure that shows some great sword fighting.

    Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on Robert E. Howard stories trend. Because after 20 years, we'll have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on J.R.R. Tolkien stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s (such as Conan, The Beastmaster, He-Man in Masters of the Universe, and else). And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s (such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, and even Spy Kids in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi). In (Conan the Barbarian) Schwarzenegger proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie ! And this is great considering the known nature of these movies, whereas  frankly  the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic ! Generally it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the costumes are mostly reveling to assure the sex factor and  in the same time  dirty to evoke the uncivilized age which the movie takes place in. The fights are damn memorable. They were so real; remember that Schwarzenegger required many stitches and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that Sandahl Bergman had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies ! Still, the pace of the movie is one of the most interesting points in it. It isn't another action with desert adventures and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste. Speaking about the "seriousness" and "meditation" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only. It has extra with the shadows it uses to fulfill that revenge story. It's where the "sword" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the "sorcery", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this.. It's strange, or kind of bold, to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But this is the movie's substance and intellectual point of view; where barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship. You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the matter as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous, yet more powerful, man to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being "an analogy of Christ's life", "a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head" and "an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets" (??!), all made by guys think a bit too much as you see ! The cons can be felt in few elements : The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. Sandahl Bergman wasn't that sexy or beautiful. Gerry Lopez is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers. James Earl Jones's head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax. So this is a different action. Not due to the abundant sex and violence (which you can find in many other movies). But due to the high qualities, the distinct pace, and the forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind.

    In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold. Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic. Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called "The Wheel of Pain" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose. This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score. It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production. Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter "Crom!" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it. As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up. The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's "Apocalypse Now" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention. As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.

    Had heard about this for years but never got an opportunity to view it before now. Turned out to be slightly different from my expectations. It turned out not to have a well-defined plot but more a series of random incidents - at least in the beginning - which somehow lead the protagonist to the ultimate confrontation as if destiny has preordained it. There is also an emphasis on minimal dialogue which works in the film's favour by reducing clunky exposition and making it more of an action-packed visual spectacle. And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue. The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent. A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes. That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, "Crom!" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour. Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess. Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing. All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.

    Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.

    I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. I have read that some people criticize three things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no "laurence Olivier" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is precisely what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need "Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others, they are not brilliant, they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic. Some other guy said that there is "little violence" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood. The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow&iexcl;&iexcl; in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all "Black & White". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are incredibly credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic "friedrich Nietzsche" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the "Super-Human or Super-Man". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a "so speaks Zarathustra" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some "fascistoid" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.

    i usually don't review a movie unless i feel there is something that must be said. and in this movie there is something like that. do you want deep and long conversations ? yells and roars of battle ? well you came to the wrong place ! in this one they speak short and important, the rest, the viewer must know threw visual and music purely. the visuals which were not too much but not too little, always was completely synced with the exact music and sounds that led us through the movie. but when needed some 'push', a few sentences came but enough to be considered unnoticeable. this movie, which is 2 hours long with some weird sorcery and costumed fighting that most of the time make the viewer(me) unconformable and unwatchable, this one actually make us even more deep in the movie's experience, no matter the age. with this new age of extremely developed CGI technology, there is no need in casting 100 people for a ceremony and action scenes will be much more faster stronger, but they will always miss something that i find very important, sometimes much stronger than the use of CGI, REALITY.

    Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, "Conan the Barbarian" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. "Conan the Barbarian" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel. But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle. 5.5/10

    Directed by John Milius, "Conan the Barbarian" is an exaltation of all things barbaric. Some context: Milius is mostly known today for being the basis of Walter Sobchak, the gun-loving right-winger of the Coen Brothers' "Big Lebowski". There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his "hard-right politics", which he lovingly equates with "rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo". Milius' films ("Big Wednesday", "Magnum Force", "Dilinger", "Conan", "Red Dawn" etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing "Dirty Harry", Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because "guns are more honourable than money". "Conan" was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote "Apocalypse Now") salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance. Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. "Conan" doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' "everyman warriors" vs "the evil Other who steals our Freedom" tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist "Private Ryan"). Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - "That which does not kill us makes us stronger" - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of "the will to power", the expression of human existence superior to that of the "conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority". Nietzsche "attacks man's moral principles" such that "the new superman is a law unto himself". He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who "builds himself up into a being beyond the mob". "His secret nobility," Nietzsche then says, "will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists". The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne. So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's "mind and flesh are greater than steel", Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness. Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity  gratuitous in another picture  only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled "Theology/Civilization", has itself become well known in concert circuits. Like "Star Wars" (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy/mythological film which preceded it, "Conan" is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman  who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior  a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells "Conan, what is best in life?", Arnie responds like a caveman: "To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women!" Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - "Do you want to live forever?!" - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies. The film was followed by a worthless sequel. "Conan" itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain. Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was "Red Dawn", essentially Conan with kids. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on Robert E. Howard stories trend. Because after 20 years, we'll have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on J.R.R. Tolkien stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s (such as Conan, The Beastmaster, He-Man in Masters of the Universe, and else). And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s (such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, and even Spy Kids in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi). In (Conan the Barbarian) Schwarzenegger proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie ! And this is great considering the known nature of these movies, whereas  frankly  the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic ! Generally it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the costumes are mostly reveling to assure the sex factor and  in the same time  dirty to evoke the uncivilized age which the movie takes place in. The fights are damn memorable. They were so real; remember that Schwarzenegger required many stitches and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that Sandahl Bergman had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies ! Still, the pace of the movie is one of the most interesting points in it. It isn't another action with desert adventures and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste. Speaking about the "seriousness" and "meditation" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only. It has extra with the shadows it uses to fulfill that revenge story. It's where the "sword" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the "sorcery", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this.. It's strange, or kind of bold, to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But this is the movie's substance and intellectual point of view; where barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship. You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the matter as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous, yet more powerful, man to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being "an analogy of Christ's life", "a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head" and "an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets" (??!), all made by guys think a bit too much as you see ! The cons can be felt in few elements : The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. Sandahl Bergman wasn't that sexy or beautiful. Gerry Lopez is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers. James Earl Jones's head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax. So this is a different action. Not due to the abundant sex and violence (which you can find in many other movies). But due to the high qualities, the distinct pace, and the forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind.

    In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold. Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic. Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called "The Wheel of Pain" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose. This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score. It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production. Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter "Crom!" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it. As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up. The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's "Apocalypse Now" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention. As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.

    Had heard about this for years but never got an opportunity to view it before now. Turned out to be slightly different from my expectations. It turned out not to have a well-defined plot but more a series of random incidents - at least in the beginning - which somehow lead the protagonist to the ultimate confrontation as if destiny has preordained it. There is also an emphasis on minimal dialogue which works in the film's favour by reducing clunky exposition and making it more of an action-packed visual spectacle. And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue. The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent. A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes. That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, "Crom!" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour. Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess. Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing. All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.

    Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.

    I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. I have read that some people criticize three things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no "laurence Olivier" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is precisely what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need "Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others, they are not brilliant, they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic. Some other guy said that there is "little violence" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood. The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow&iexcl;&iexcl; in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all "Black & White". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are incredibly credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic "friedrich Nietzsche" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the "Super-Human or Super-Man". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a "so speaks Zarathustra" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some "fascistoid" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.

    i usually don't review a movie unless i feel there is something that must be said. and in this movie there is something like that. do you want deep and long conversations ? yells and roars of battle ? well you came to the wrong place ! in this one they speak short and important, the rest, the viewer must know threw visual and music purely. the visuals which were not too much but not too little, always was completely synced with the exact music and sounds that led us through the movie. but when needed some 'push', a few sentences came but enough to be considered unnoticeable. this movie, which is 2 hours long with some weird sorcery and costumed fighting that most of the time make the viewer(me) unconformable and unwatchable, this one actually make us even more deep in the movie's experience, no matter the age. with this new age of extremely developed CGI technology, there is no need in casting 100 people for a ceremony and action scenes will be much more faster stronger, but they will always miss something that i find very important, sometimes much stronger than the use of CGI, REALITY.

    Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, "Conan the Barbarian" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. "Conan the Barbarian" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel. But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle. 5.5/10

    Directed by John Milius, "Conan the Barbarian" is an exaltation of all things barbaric. Some context: Milius is mostly known today for being the basis of Walter Sobchak, the gun-loving right-winger of the Coen Brothers' "Big Lebowski". There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his "hard-right politics", which he lovingly equates with "rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo". Milius' films ("Big Wednesday", "Magnum Force", "Dilinger", "Conan", "Red Dawn" etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing "Dirty Harry", Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because "guns are more honourable than money". "Conan" was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote "Apocalypse Now") salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance. Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. "Conan" doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' "everyman warriors" vs "the evil Other who steals our Freedom" tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist "Private Ryan"). Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - "That which does not kill us makes us stronger" - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of "the will to power", the expression of human existence superior to that of the "conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority". Nietzsche "attacks man's moral principles" such that "the new superman is a law unto himself". He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who "builds himself up into a being beyond the mob". "His secret nobility," Nietzsche then says, "will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists". The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne. So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's "mind and flesh are greater than steel", Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness. Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity  gratuitous in another picture  only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled "Theology/Civilization", has itself become well known in concert circuits. Like "Star Wars" (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy/mythological film which preceded it, "Conan" is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman  who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior  a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells "Conan, what is best in life?", Arnie responds like a caveman: "To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women!" Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - "Do you want to live forever?!" - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies. The film was followed by a worthless sequel. "Conan" itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain. Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was "Red Dawn", essentially Conan with kids. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Arnold has entertained me in many movies over the years (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, Collateral Damage, Eraser), so I can forgive his pitiful acting in this film and just sit back and enjoy it. Of course, the best thing about the film was the presence of Sandahl Bergman, originally a Golddigger from "The Dean Martin Show". She can act and did a very good job of it. I also enjoyed Mako (The Sand Pebbles) and Gerry Lopez, who I guess gave up acting for surfing. It is just a plain guilty pleasure that shows some great sword fighting.

    Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on Robert E. Howard stories trend. Because after 20 years, we'll have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on J.R.R. Tolkien stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s (such as Conan, The Beastmaster, He-Man in Masters of the Universe, and else). And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s (such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, and even Spy Kids in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi). In (Conan the Barbarian) Schwarzenegger proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie ! And this is great considering the known nature of these movies, whereas  frankly  the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic ! Generally it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the costumes are mostly reveling to assure the sex factor and  in the same time  dirty to evoke the uncivilized age which the movie takes place in. The fights are damn memorable. They were so real; remember that Schwarzenegger required many stitches and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that Sandahl Bergman had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies ! Still, the pace of the movie is one of the most interesting points in it. It isn't another action with desert adventures and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste. Speaking about the "seriousness" and "meditation" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only. It has extra with the shadows it uses to fulfill that revenge story. It's where the "sword" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the "sorcery", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this.. It's strange, or kind of bold, to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But this is the movie's substance and intellectual point of view; where barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship. You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the matter as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous, yet more powerful, man to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being "an analogy of Christ's life", "a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head" and "an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets" (??!), all made by guys think a bit too much as you see ! The cons can be felt in few elements : The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. Sandahl Bergman wasn't that sexy or beautiful. Gerry Lopez is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers. James Earl Jones's head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax. So this is a different action. Not due to the abundant sex and violence (which you can find in many other movies). But due to the high qualities, the distinct pace, and the forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind.

    In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold. Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic. Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called "The Wheel of Pain" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose. This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score. It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production. Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter "Crom!" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it. As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up. The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's "Apocalypse Now" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention. As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.

    Had heard about this for years but never got an opportunity to view it before now. Turned out to be slightly different from my expectations. It turned out not to have a well-defined plot but more a series of random incidents - at least in the beginning - which somehow lead the protagonist to the ultimate confrontation as if destiny has preordained it. There is also an emphasis on minimal dialogue which works in the film's favour by reducing clunky exposition and making it more of an action-packed visual spectacle. And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue. The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent. A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes. That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, "Crom!" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour. Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess. Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing. All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.

    Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.

    I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. I have read that some people criticize three things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no "laurence Olivier" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is precisely what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need "Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others, they are not brilliant, they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic. Some other guy said that there is "little violence" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood. The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow&iexcl;&iexcl; in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all "Black & White". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are incredibly credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic "friedrich Nietzsche" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the "Super-Human or Super-Man". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a "so speaks Zarathustra" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some "fascistoid" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.

    i usually don't review a movie unless i feel there is something that must be said. and in this movie there is something like that. do you want deep and long conversations ? yells and roars of battle ? well you came to the wrong place ! in this one they speak short and important, the rest, the viewer must know threw visual and music purely. the visuals which were not too much but not too little, always was completely synced with the exact music and sounds that led us through the movie. but when needed some 'push', a few sentences came but enough to be considered unnoticeable. this movie, which is 2 hours long with some weird sorcery and costumed fighting that most of the time make the viewer(me) unconformable and unwatchable, this one actually make us even more deep in the movie's experience, no matter the age. with this new age of extremely developed CGI technology, there is no need in casting 100 people for a ceremony and action scenes will be much more faster stronger, but they will always miss something that i find very important, sometimes much stronger than the use of CGI, REALITY.

    Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, "Conan the Barbarian" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. "Conan the Barbarian" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel. But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle. 5.5/10

    Directed by John Milius, "Conan the Barbarian" is an exaltation of all things barbaric. Some context: Milius is mostly known today for being the basis of Walter Sobchak, the gun-loving right-winger of the Coen Brothers' "Big Lebowski". There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his "hard-right politics", which he lovingly equates with "rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo". Milius' films ("Big Wednesday", "Magnum Force", "Dilinger", "Conan", "Red Dawn" etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing "Dirty Harry", Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because "guns are more honourable than money". "Conan" was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote "Apocalypse Now") salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance. Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. "Conan" doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' "everyman warriors" vs "the evil Other who steals our Freedom" tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist "Private Ryan"). Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - "That which does not kill us makes us stronger" - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of "the will to power", the expression of human existence superior to that of the "conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority". Nietzsche "attacks man's moral principles" such that "the new superman is a law unto himself". He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who "builds himself up into a being beyond the mob". "His secret nobility," Nietzsche then says, "will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists". The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne. So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's "mind and flesh are greater than steel", Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness. Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity  gratuitous in another picture  only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled "Theology/Civilization", has itself become well known in concert circuits. Like "Star Wars" (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy/mythological film which preceded it, "Conan" is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman  who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior  a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells "Conan, what is best in life?", Arnie responds like a caveman: "To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women!" Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - "Do you want to live forever?!" - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies. The film was followed by a worthless sequel. "Conan" itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain. Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was "Red Dawn", essentially Conan with kids. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Arnold has entertained me in many movies over the years (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, Collateral Damage, Eraser), so I can forgive his pitiful acting in this film and just sit back and enjoy it. Of course, the best thing about the film was the presence of Sandahl Bergman, originally a Golddigger from "The Dean Martin Show". She can act and did a very good job of it. I also enjoyed Mako (The Sand Pebbles) and Gerry Lopez, who I guess gave up acting for surfing. It is just a plain guilty pleasure that shows some great sword fighting.

    Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on Robert E. Howard stories trend. Because after 20 years, we'll have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on J.R.R. Tolkien stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s (such as Conan, The Beastmaster, He-Man in Masters of the Universe, and else). And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s (such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, and even Spy Kids in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi). In (Conan the Barbarian) Schwarzenegger proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie ! And this is great considering the known nature of these movies, whereas  frankly  the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic ! Generally it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the costumes are mostly reveling to assure the sex factor and  in the same time  dirty to evoke the uncivilized age which the movie takes place in. The fights are damn memorable. They were so real; remember that Schwarzenegger required many stitches and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that Sandahl Bergman had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies ! Still, the pace of the movie is one of the most interesting points in it. It isn't another action with desert adventures and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste. Speaking about the "seriousness" and "meditation" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only. It has extra with the shadows it uses to fulfill that revenge story. It's where the "sword" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the "sorcery", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this.. It's strange, or kind of bold, to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But this is the movie's substance and intellectual point of view; where barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship. You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the matter as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous, yet more powerful, man to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being "an analogy of Christ's life", "a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head" and "an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets" (??!), all made by guys think a bit too much as you see ! The cons can be felt in few elements : The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. Sandahl Bergman wasn't that sexy or beautiful. Gerry Lopez is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers. James Earl Jones's head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax. So this is a different action. Not due to the abundant sex and violence (which you can find in many other movies). But due to the high qualities, the distinct pace, and the forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind.

    In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold. Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic. Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called "The Wheel of Pain" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose. This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score. It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production. Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter "Crom!" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it. As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up. The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's "Apocalypse Now" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention. As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.

    Had heard about this for years but never got an opportunity to view it before now. Turned out to be slightly different from my expectations. It turned out not to have a well-defined plot but more a series of random incidents - at least in the beginning - which somehow lead the protagonist to the ultimate confrontation as if destiny has preordained it. There is also an emphasis on minimal dialogue which works in the film's favour by reducing clunky exposition and making it more of an action-packed visual spectacle. And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue. The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent. A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes. That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, "Crom!" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour. Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess. Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing. All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.

    Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.

    I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. I have read that some people criticize three things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no "laurence Olivier" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is precisely what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need "Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others, they are not brilliant, they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic. Some other guy said that there is "little violence" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood. The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow&iexcl;&iexcl; in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all "Black & White". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are incredibly credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic "friedrich Nietzsche" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the "Super-Human or Super-Man". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a "so speaks Zarathustra" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some "fascistoid" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.

    i usually don't review a movie unless i feel there is something that must be said. and in this movie there is something like that. do you want deep and long conversations ? yells and roars of battle ? well you came to the wrong place ! in this one they speak short and important, the rest, the viewer must know threw visual and music purely. the visuals which were not too much but not too little, always was completely synced with the exact music and sounds that led us through the movie. but when needed some 'push', a few sentences came but enough to be considered unnoticeable. this movie, which is 2 hours long with some weird sorcery and costumed fighting that most of the time make the viewer(me) unconformable and unwatchable, this one actually make us even more deep in the movie's experience, no matter the age. with this new age of extremely developed CGI technology, there is no need in casting 100 people for a ceremony and action scenes will be much more faster stronger, but they will always miss something that i find very important, sometimes much stronger than the use of CGI, REALITY.

    Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, "Conan the Barbarian" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. "Conan the Barbarian" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel. But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle. 5.5/10

    Directed by John Milius, "Conan the Barbarian" is an exaltation of all things barbaric. Some context: Milius is mostly known today for being the basis of Walter Sobchak, the gun-loving right-winger of the Coen Brothers' "Big Lebowski". There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his "hard-right politics", which he lovingly equates with "rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo". Milius' films ("Big Wednesday", "Magnum Force", "Dilinger", "Conan", "Red Dawn" etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing "Dirty Harry", Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because "guns are more honourable than money". "Conan" was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote "Apocalypse Now") salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance. Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. "Conan" doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' "everyman warriors" vs "the evil Other who steals our Freedom" tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist "Private Ryan"). Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - "That which does not kill us makes us stronger" - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of "the will to power", the expression of human existence superior to that of the "conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority". Nietzsche "attacks man's moral principles" such that "the new superman is a law unto himself". He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who "builds himself up into a being beyond the mob". "His secret nobility," Nietzsche then says, "will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists". The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne. So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's "mind and flesh are greater than steel", Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness. Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity  gratuitous in another picture  only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled "Theology/Civilization", has itself become well known in concert circuits. Like "Star Wars" (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy/mythological film which preceded it, "Conan" is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman  who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior  a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells "Conan, what is best in life?", Arnie responds like a caveman: "To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women!" Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - "Do you want to live forever?!" - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies. The film was followed by a worthless sequel. "Conan" itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain. Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was "Red Dawn", essentially Conan with kids. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Arnold has entertained me in many movies over the years (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, Collateral Damage, Eraser), so I can forgive his pitiful acting in this film and just sit back and enjoy it. Of course, the best thing about the film was the presence of Sandahl Bergman, originally a Golddigger from "The Dean Martin Show". She can act and did a very good job of it. I also enjoyed Mako (The Sand Pebbles) and Gerry Lopez, who I guess gave up acting for surfing. It is just a plain guilty pleasure that shows some great sword fighting.

    Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on Robert E. Howard stories trend. Because after 20 years, we'll have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on J.R.R. Tolkien stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s (such as Conan, The Beastmaster, He-Man in Masters of the Universe, and else). And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s (such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, and even Spy Kids in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi). In (Conan the Barbarian) Schwarzenegger proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie ! And this is great considering the known nature of these movies, whereas  frankly  the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic ! Generally it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the costumes are mostly reveling to assure the sex factor and  in the same time  dirty to evoke the uncivilized age which the movie takes place in. The fights are damn memorable. They were so real; remember that Schwarzenegger required many stitches and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that Sandahl Bergman had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies ! Still, the pace of the movie is one of the most interesting points in it. It isn't another action with desert adventures and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste. Speaking about the "seriousness" and "meditation" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only. It has extra with the shadows it uses to fulfill that revenge story. It's where the "sword" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the "sorcery", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this.. It's strange, or kind of bold, to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But this is the movie's substance and intellectual point of view; where barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship. You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the matter as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous, yet more powerful, man to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being "an analogy of Christ's life", "a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head" and "an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets" (??!), all made by guys think a bit too much as you see ! The cons can be felt in few elements : The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. Sandahl Bergman wasn't that sexy or beautiful. Gerry Lopez is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers. James Earl Jones's head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax. So this is a different action. Not due to the abundant sex and violence (which you can find in many other movies). But due to the high qualities, the distinct pace, and the forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind.

    In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold. Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic. Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called "The Wheel of Pain" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose. This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score. It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production. Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter "Crom!" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it. As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up. The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's "Apocalypse Now" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention. As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.

    Had heard about this for years but never got an opportunity to view it before now. Turned out to be slightly different from my expectations. It turned out not to have a well-defined plot but more a series of random incidents - at least in the beginning - which somehow lead the protagonist to the ultimate confrontation as if destiny has preordained it. There is also an emphasis on minimal dialogue which works in the film's favour by reducing clunky exposition and making it more of an action-packed visual spectacle. And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue. The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent. A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes. That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, "Crom!" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour. Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess. Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing. All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.

    Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.

    I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. I have read that some people criticize three things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no "laurence Olivier" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is precisely what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need "Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others, they are not brilliant, they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic. Some other guy said that there is "little violence" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood. The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow&iexcl;&iexcl; in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all "Black & White". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are incredibly credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic "friedrich Nietzsche" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the "Super-Human or Super-Man". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a "so speaks Zarathustra" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some "fascistoid" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.

    i usually don't review a movie unless i feel there is something that must be said. and in this movie there is something like that. do you want deep and long conversations ? yells and roars of battle ? well you came to the wrong place ! in this one they speak short and important, the rest, the viewer must know threw visual and music purely. the visuals which were not too much but not too little, always was completely synced with the exact music and sounds that led us through the movie. but when needed some 'push', a few sentences came but enough to be considered unnoticeable. this movie, which is 2 hours long with some weird sorcery and costumed fighting that most of the time make the viewer(me) unconformable and unwatchable, this one actually make us even more deep in the movie's experience, no matter the age. with this new age of extremely developed CGI technology, there is no need in casting 100 people for a ceremony and action scenes will be much more faster stronger, but they will always miss something that i find very important, sometimes much stronger than the use of CGI, REALITY.

    Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, "Conan the Barbarian" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. "Conan the Barbarian" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel. But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle. 5.5/10

    Directed by John Milius, "Conan the Barbarian" is an exaltation of all things barbaric. Some context: Milius is mostly known today for being the basis of Walter Sobchak, the gun-loving right-winger of the Coen Brothers' "Big Lebowski". There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his "hard-right politics", which he lovingly equates with "rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo". Milius' films ("Big Wednesday", "Magnum Force", "Dilinger", "Conan", "Red Dawn" etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing "Dirty Harry", Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because "guns are more honourable than money". "Conan" was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote "Apocalypse Now") salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance. Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. "Conan" doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' "everyman warriors" vs "the evil Other who steals our Freedom" tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist "Private Ryan"). Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - "That which does not kill us makes us stronger" - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of "the will to power", the expression of human existence superior to that of the "conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority". Nietzsche "attacks man's moral principles" such that "the new superman is a law unto himself". He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who "builds himself up into a being beyond the mob". "His secret nobility," Nietzsche then says, "will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists". The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne. So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's "mind and flesh are greater than steel", Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness. Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity  gratuitous in another picture  only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled "Theology/Civilization", has itself become well known in concert circuits. Like "Star Wars" (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy/mythological film which preceded it, "Conan" is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman  who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior  a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells "Conan, what is best in life?", Arnie responds like a caveman: "To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women!" Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - "Do you want to live forever?!" - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies. The film was followed by a worthless sequel. "Conan" itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain. Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was "Red Dawn", essentially Conan with kids. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Arnold has entertained me in many movies over the years (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, Collateral Damage, Eraser), so I can forgive his pitiful acting in this film and just sit back and enjoy it. Of course, the best thing about the film was the presence of Sandahl Bergman, originally a Golddigger from "The Dean Martin Show". She can act and did a very good job of it. I also enjoyed Mako (The Sand Pebbles) and Gerry Lopez, who I guess gave up acting for surfing. It is just a plain guilty pleasure that shows some great sword fighting.

    Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on Robert E. Howard stories trend. Because after 20 years, we'll have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on J.R.R. Tolkien stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s (such as Conan, The Beastmaster, He-Man in Masters of the Universe, and else). And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s (such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, and even Spy Kids in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi). In (Conan the Barbarian) Schwarzenegger proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie ! And this is great considering the known nature of these movies, whereas  frankly  the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic ! Generally it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the costumes are mostly reveling to assure the sex factor and  in the same time  dirty to evoke the uncivilized age which the movie takes place in. The fights are damn memorable. They were so real; remember that Schwarzenegger required many stitches and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that Sandahl Bergman had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies ! Still, the pace of the movie is one of the most interesting points in it. It isn't another action with desert adventures and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste. Speaking about the "seriousness" and "meditation" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only. It has extra with the shadows it uses to fulfill that revenge story. It's where the "sword" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the "sorcery", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this.. It's strange, or kind of bold, to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But this is the movie's substance and intellectual point of view; where barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship. You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the matter as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous, yet more powerful, man to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being "an analogy of Christ's life", "a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head" and "an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets" (??!), all made by guys think a bit too much as you see ! The cons can be felt in few elements : The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. Sandahl Bergman wasn't that sexy or beautiful. Gerry Lopez is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers. James Earl Jones's head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax. So this is a different action. Not due to the abundant sex and violence (which you can find in many other movies). But due to the high qualities, the distinct pace, and the forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind.

    In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold. Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic. Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called "The Wheel of Pain" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose. This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score. It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production. Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter "Crom!" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it. As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up. The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's "Apocalypse Now" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention. As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.

    Had heard about this for years but never got an opportunity to view it before now. Turned out to be slightly different from my expectations. It turned out not to have a well-defined plot but more a series of random incidents - at least in the beginning - which somehow lead the protagonist to the ultimate confrontation as if destiny has preordained it. There is also an emphasis on minimal dialogue which works in the film's favour by reducing clunky exposition and making it more of an action-packed visual spectacle. And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue. The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent. A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes. That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, "Crom!" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour. Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess. Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing. All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.

    Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.

    I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. I have read that some people criticize three things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no "laurence Olivier" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is precisely what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need "Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others, they are not brilliant, they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic. Some other guy said that there is "little violence" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood. The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow&iexcl;&iexcl; in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all "Black & White". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are incredibly credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic "friedrich Nietzsche" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the "Super-Human or Super-Man". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a "so speaks Zarathustra" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some "fascistoid" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.

    i usually don't review a movie unless i feel there is something that must be said. and in this movie there is something like that. do you want deep and long conversations ? yells and roars of battle ? well you came to the wrong place ! in this one they speak short and important, the rest, the viewer must know threw visual and music purely. the visuals which were not too much but not too little, always was completely synced with the exact music and sounds that led us through the movie. but when needed some 'push', a few sentences came but enough to be considered unnoticeable. this movie, which is 2 hours long with some weird sorcery and costumed fighting that most of the time make the viewer(me) unconformable and unwatchable, this one actually make us even more deep in the movie's experience, no matter the age. with this new age of extremely developed CGI technology, there is no need in casting 100 people for a ceremony and action scenes will be much more faster stronger, but they will always miss something that i find very important, sometimes much stronger than the use of CGI, REALITY.

    Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, "Conan the Barbarian" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. "Conan the Barbarian" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel. But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle. 5.5/10

    Directed by John Milius, "Conan the Barbarian" is an exaltation of all things barbaric. Some context: Milius is mostly known today for being the basis of Walter Sobchak, the gun-loving right-winger of the Coen Brothers' "Big Lebowski". There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his "hard-right politics", which he lovingly equates with "rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo". Milius' films ("Big Wednesday", "Magnum Force", "Dilinger", "Conan", "Red Dawn" etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing "Dirty Harry", Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because "guns are more honourable than money". "Conan" was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote "Apocalypse Now") salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance. Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. "Conan" doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' "everyman warriors" vs "the evil Other who steals our Freedom" tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist "Private Ryan"). Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - "That which does not kill us makes us stronger" - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of "the will to power", the expression of human existence superior to that of the "conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority". Nietzsche "attacks man's moral principles" such that "the new superman is a law unto himself". He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who "builds himself up into a being beyond the mob". "His secret nobility," Nietzsche then says, "will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists". The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne. So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's "mind and flesh are greater than steel", Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness. Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity  gratuitous in another picture  only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled "Theology/Civilization", has itself become well known in concert circuits. Like "Star Wars" (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy/mythological film which preceded it, "Conan" is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman  who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior  a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells "Conan, what is best in life?", Arnie responds like a caveman: "To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women!" Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - "Do you want to live forever?!" - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies. The film was followed by a worthless sequel. "Conan" itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain. Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was "Red Dawn", essentially Conan with kids. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Arnold has entertained me in many movies over the years (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, Collateral Damage, Eraser), so I can forgive his pitiful acting in this film and just sit back and enjoy it. Of course, the best thing about the film was the presence of Sandahl Bergman, originally a Golddigger from "The Dean Martin Show". She can act and did a very good job of it. I also enjoyed Mako (The Sand Pebbles) and Gerry Lopez, who I guess gave up acting for surfing. It is just a plain guilty pleasure that shows some great sword fighting.

    Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on Robert E. Howard stories trend. Because after 20 years, we'll have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on J.R.R. Tolkien stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s (such as Conan, The Beastmaster, He-Man in Masters of the Universe, and else). And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s (such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, and even Spy Kids in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi). In (Conan the Barbarian) Schwarzenegger proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie ! And this is great considering the known nature of these movies, whereas  frankly  the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic ! Generally it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the costumes are mostly reveling to assure the sex factor and  in the same time  dirty to evoke the uncivilized age which the movie takes place in. The fights are damn memorable. They were so real; remember that Schwarzenegger required many stitches and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that Sandahl Bergman had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies ! Still, the pace of the movie is one of the most interesting points in it. It isn't another action with desert adventures and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste. Speaking about the "seriousness" and "meditation" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only. It has extra with the shadows it uses to fulfill that revenge story. It's where the "sword" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the "sorcery", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this.. It's strange, or kind of bold, to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But this is the movie's substance and intellectual point of view; where barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship. You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the matter as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous, yet more powerful, man to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being "an analogy of Christ's life", "a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head" and "an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets" (??!), all made by guys think a bit too much as you see ! The cons can be felt in few elements : The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. Sandahl Bergman wasn't that sexy or beautiful. Gerry Lopez is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers. James Earl Jones's head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax. So this is a different action. Not due to the abundant sex and violence (which you can find in many other movies). But due to the high qualities, the distinct pace, and the forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind.

    In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold. Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic. Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called "The Wheel of Pain" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose. This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score. It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production. Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter "Crom!" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it. As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up. The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's "Apocalypse Now" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention. As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.

    Had heard about this for years but never got an opportunity to view it before now. Turned out to be slightly different from my expectations. It turned out not to have a well-defined plot but more a series of random incidents - at least in the beginning - which somehow lead the protagonist to the ultimate confrontation as if destiny has preordained it. There is also an emphasis on minimal dialogue which works in the film's favour by reducing clunky exposition and making it more of an action-packed visual spectacle. And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue. The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent. A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes. That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, "Crom!" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour. Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess. Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing. All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.

    Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.

    I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. I have read that some people criticize three things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no "laurence Olivier" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is precisely what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need "Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others, they are not brilliant, they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic. Some other guy said that there is "little violence" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood. The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow&iexcl;&iexcl; in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all "Black & White". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are incredibly credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic "friedrich Nietzsche" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the "Super-Human or Super-Man". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a "so speaks Zarathustra" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some "fascistoid" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.

    i usually don't review a movie unless i feel there is something that must be said. and in this movie there is something like that. do you want deep and long conversations ? yells and roars of battle ? well you came to the wrong place ! in this one they speak short and important, the rest, the viewer must know threw visual and music purely. the visuals which were not too much but not too little, always was completely synced with the exact music and sounds that led us through the movie. but when needed some 'push', a few sentences came but enough to be considered unnoticeable. this movie, which is 2 hours long with some weird sorcery and costumed fighting that most of the time make the viewer(me) unconformable and unwatchable, this one actually make us even more deep in the movie's experience, no matter the age. with this new age of extremely developed CGI technology, there is no need in casting 100 people for a ceremony and action scenes will be much more faster stronger, but they will always miss something that i find very important, sometimes much stronger than the use of CGI, REALITY.

    Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, "Conan the Barbarian" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. "Conan the Barbarian" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel. But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle. 5.5/10

    Directed by John Milius, "Conan the Barbarian" is an exaltation of all things barbaric. Some context: Milius is mostly known today for being the basis of Walter Sobchak, the gun-loving right-winger of the Coen Brothers' "Big Lebowski". There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his "hard-right politics", which he lovingly equates with "rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo". Milius' films ("Big Wednesday", "Magnum Force", "Dilinger", "Conan", "Red Dawn" etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing "Dirty Harry", Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because "guns are more honourable than money". "Conan" was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote "Apocalypse Now") salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance. Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. "Conan" doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' "everyman warriors" vs "the evil Other who steals our Freedom" tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist "Private Ryan"). Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - "That which does not kill us makes us stronger" - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of "the will to power", the expression of human existence superior to that of the "conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority". Nietzsche "attacks man's moral principles" such that "the new superman is a law unto himself". He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who "builds himself up into a being beyond the mob". "His secret nobility," Nietzsche then says, "will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists". The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne. So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's "mind and flesh are greater than steel", Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness. Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity  gratuitous in another picture  only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled "Theology/Civilization", has itself become well known in concert circuits. Like "Star Wars" (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy/mythological film which preceded it, "Conan" is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman  who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior  a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells "Conan, what is best in life?", Arnie responds like a caveman: "To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women!" Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - "Do you want to live forever?!" - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies. The film was followed by a worthless sequel. "Conan" itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain. Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was "Red Dawn", essentially Conan with kids. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Arnold has entertained me in many movies over the years (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, Collateral Damage, Eraser), so I can forgive his pitiful acting in this film and just sit back and enjoy it. Of course, the best thing about the film was the presence of Sandahl Bergman, originally a Golddigger from "The Dean Martin Show". She can act and did a very good job of it. I also enjoyed Mako (The Sand Pebbles) and Gerry Lopez, who I guess gave up acting for surfing. It is just a plain guilty pleasure that shows some great sword fighting.

    Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on Robert E. Howard stories trend. Because after 20 years, we'll have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on J.R.R. Tolkien stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s (such as Conan, The Beastmaster, He-Man in Masters of the Universe, and else). And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s (such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, and even Spy Kids in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi). In (Conan the Barbarian) Schwarzenegger proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie ! And this is great considering the known nature of these movies, whereas  frankly  the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic ! Generally it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the costumes are mostly reveling to assure the sex factor and  in the same time  dirty to evoke the uncivilized age which the movie takes place in. The fights are damn memorable. They were so real; remember that Schwarzenegger required many stitches and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that Sandahl Bergman had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies ! Still, the pace of the movie is one of the most interesting points in it. It isn't another action with desert adventures and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste. Speaking about the "seriousness" and "meditation" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only. It has extra with the shadows it uses to fulfill that revenge story. It's where the "sword" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the "sorcery", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this.. It's strange, or kind of bold, to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But this is the movie's substance and intellectual point of view; where barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship. You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the matter as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous, yet more powerful, man to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being "an analogy of Christ's life", "a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head" and "an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets" (??!), all made by guys think a bit too much as you see ! The cons can be felt in few elements : The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. Sandahl Bergman wasn't that sexy or beautiful. Gerry Lopez is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers. James Earl Jones's head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax. So this is a different action. Not due to the abundant sex and violence (which you can find in many other movies). But due to the high qualities, the distinct pace, and the forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind.

    In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold. Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic. Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called "The Wheel of Pain" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose. This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score. It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production. Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter "Crom!" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it. As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up. The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's "Apocalypse Now" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention. As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.

And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue. The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent. A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes. That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, "Crom!" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour. Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess. Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing. All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.

    Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.

    I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. I have read that some people criticize three things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no "laurence Olivier" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is precisely what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need "Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others, they are not brilliant, they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic. Some other guy said that there is "little violence" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood. The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow&iexcl;&iexcl; in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all "Black & White". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are incredibly credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic "friedrich Nietzsche" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the "Super-Human or Super-Man". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a "so speaks Zarathustra" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some "fascistoid" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.

    i usually don't review a movie unless i feel there is something that must be said. and in this movie there is something like that. do you want deep and long conversations ? yells and roars of battle ? well you came to the wrong place ! in this one they speak short and important, the rest, the viewer must know threw visual and music purely. the visuals which were not too much but not too little, always was completely synced with the exact music and sounds that led us through the movie. but when needed some 'push', a few sentences came but enough to be considered unnoticeable. this movie, which is 2 hours long with some weird sorcery and costumed fighting that most of the time make the viewer(me) unconformable and unwatchable, this one actually make us even more deep in the movie's experience, no matter the age. with this new age of extremely developed CGI technology, there is no need in casting 100 people for a ceremony and action scenes will be much more faster stronger, but they will always miss something that i find very important, sometimes much stronger than the use of CGI, REALITY.

    Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, "Conan the Barbarian" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. "Conan the Barbarian" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel. But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle. 5.5/10

    Directed by John Milius, "Conan the Barbarian" is an exaltation of all things barbaric. Some context: Milius is mostly known today for being the basis of Walter Sobchak, the gun-loving right-winger of the Coen Brothers' "Big Lebowski". There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his "hard-right politics", which he lovingly equates with "rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo". Milius' films ("Big Wednesday", "Magnum Force", "Dilinger", "Conan", "Red Dawn" etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing "Dirty Harry", Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because "guns are more honourable than money". "Conan" was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote "Apocalypse Now") salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance. Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. "Conan" doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' "everyman warriors" vs "the evil Other who steals our Freedom" tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist "Private Ryan"). Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - "That which does not kill us makes us stronger" - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of "the will to power", the expression of human existence superior to that of the "conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority". Nietzsche "attacks man's moral principles" such that "the new superman is a law unto himself". He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who "builds himself up into a being beyond the mob". "His secret nobility," Nietzsche then says, "will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists". The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne. So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's "mind and flesh are greater than steel", Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness. Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity  gratuitous in another picture  only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled "Theology/Civilization", has itself become well known in concert circuits. Like "Star Wars" (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy/mythological film which preceded it, "Conan" is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman  who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior  a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells "Conan, what is best in life?", Arnie responds like a caveman: "To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women!" Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - "Do you want to live forever?!" - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies. The film was followed by a worthless sequel. "Conan" itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain. Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was "Red Dawn", essentially Conan with kids. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Arnold has entertained me in many movies over the years (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, Collateral Damage, Eraser), so I can forgive his pitiful acting in this film and just sit back and enjoy it. Of course, the best thing about the film was the presence of Sandahl Bergman, originally a Golddigger from "The Dean Martin Show". She can act and did a very good job of it. I also enjoyed Mako (The Sand Pebbles) and Gerry Lopez, who I guess gave up acting for surfing. It is just a plain guilty pleasure that shows some great sword fighting.

    Back then, they were the days of sword and sorcery movies, where sword beats sorcery, based on Robert E. Howard stories trend. Because after 20 years, we'll have another sword and sorcery movies, where sorcery beats sword, based on J.R.R. Tolkien stories trend. I believe the first kind harmonized with the metallic, one-man-army, action hero of the 1980s (such as Conan, The Beastmaster, He-Man in Masters of the Universe, and else). And the second kind harmonized with the sorcerer kid of the 2000s (such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, and even Spy Kids in a way that substitutes sorcery with sci-fi). In (Conan the Barbarian) Schwarzenegger proved himself as one of the best metallic heroes of the era (in the 1970s, Charles Bronson was considered for playing Conan). He's a man of a few words. I liked the fact that he spoke just 5 words to his girl during the whole movie ! And this is great considering the known nature of these movies, whereas  frankly  the muscles are needed above anything else. In a word, he played the metallically written character perfectly metallic ! Generally it's an effective movie that makes you believe. The production is generous, the cinematography is dazzling, the sets are inspiring, and the costumes are mostly reveling to assure the sex factor and  in the same time  dirty to evoke the uncivilized age which the movie takes place in. The fights are damn memorable. They were so real; remember that Schwarzenegger required many stitches and suffered a back injury. Not to mention that Sandahl Bergman had the tip of one finger cut off while shooting a sword-fight. Well, they're things you won't find in the CGI action of today's movies ! Still, the pace of the movie is one of the most interesting points in it. It isn't another action with desert adventures and hot sword-fights; it is rather more atmospheric and sullen. It added a considerable portion of realism and seriousness, which ensured a different sense and meditative taste. Speaking about the "seriousness" and "meditation" leads to the most interesting point at all. The movie isn't a revenge story only. It has extra with the shadows it uses to fulfill that revenge story. It's where the "sword" is barbarian idolatrous man, and his enemy, the "sorcery", is civilized religious dictator. So when the first bests the second eventually; it's not the usual happy end of similar revenge stories; it exceeds this.. It's strange, or kind of bold, to have the barbarian as the heroic figure, and the civilized as the nasty evilness. Then to make the idolatrous man vanquishes the religious dictator. But this is the movie's substance and intellectual point of view; where barbarianism is better than despotism, and idolatry is better than self worship. You may think that it somehow refuses the dark ages while supporting darker ages. But for me, when despotism has no ethics, then it is barbaric. Plus idolatry and self worship are alike. So I see the matter as barbarian idolatrous man fighting another barbarian idolatrous, yet more powerful, man to end the latter's unfairness. And there is a fervent speech against religious dictatorship after all. For others, the movie has else meanings though, which range between being "an analogy of Christ's life", "a Nazi story where a Nordic superman slices off a black's head" and "an allegory for Ronald Reagan's cold war with the Soviets" (??!), all made by guys think a bit too much as you see ! The cons can be felt in few elements : The music score was so loudly bombastic to boring and annoying extent. Sandahl Bergman wasn't that sexy or beautiful. Gerry Lopez is anything but a funny sidekick. The matter of the antagonist's daughter falling in love with the protagonist at the end was too fast to believe. And the climax lacks a satisfying final encounter between the movie's 2 conflicting powers. James Earl Jones's head flies too quickly, disappointing fairer climax. So this is a different action. Not due to the abundant sex and violence (which you can find in many other movies). But due to the high qualities, the distinct pace, and the forceful atmosphere. Its message is controversial, which adds to its difference, by originally having a message in a movie of this kind.

    In 1982, a movie was supposed to serve as the breakout device for an adventure fiction icon. Instead we got a two-decade pop-culture phenomenon named Ah-nold. Even though I've come to like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and find things in this, his first big action role, to enjoy, I felt shortchanged then and still do now. A character brimming with intrigue and life like Robert E. Howard's Conan deserved better than a rote tale that highlights the director's fixation with Nietzsche and will-to-power thematics over realizing a compelling alternate world of fantasy and magic. Something's wrong the moment we meet our main character as played by Schwarzenegger. He's walking around in circles amid a high arid landscape, pushing something called "The Wheel of Pain" that seems to be a mill of some kind but serves no apparent function. He's literally stuck in the middle of nowhere, walking in circles to no apparent purpose. This continues for much of the film. Picking up bits of stories that would be known to Howard readers in a kind of mash-up form, we see Conan at work as pit warrior, thief, and avenger, the latter being the main business of this film. Years ago, when he was a boy, Conan watched a warlord named Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) ride into Conan's village and kill his parents. After about an hour of grunting, running, and stabbing, Conan discovers a clue as to where this Thulsa Doom might be, and sets out to settle a score. It's around here that the story, written by director John Milius and Oliver Stone, finds its groove. Jones is a cool villain, the kind who can make one of Milius's philosophical exposition scenes work with a single jab of his finger. Never mind that the guy looks like a Breck girl with his long, straight hair, he's the class of the production. Schwarzenegger makes an impression, too. First it's his physique, as a lot of labored, stretchy scenes call upon him to do little else but flex his muscles and mutter "Crom!" now and then. But Schwarzenegger's considerable charm and way with a camera come across as the film rolls on. He is not a strong actor here, but from the moment he punches a camel in a crowded street, a kind of gonzo energy works its way into Schwarzenegger's performance, a sense that he's making us laugh on purpose and enjoying it. As to the rest of the cast, Sandahl Bergman looks good, moves better, but can't deliver a line convincingly as Conan's lover Valeria, while Max Von Sydow overplays a silly scene as a vexed king. Better are Mako as a wily wizard and Gerry Lopez, apparently a full-time surfer from what Milius says on the DVD commentary, who plays the thief Subotai and brings some badly needed charm and sympathy to the proceedings before the Arnold we all know finally shows up. The film builds to a gripping conclusion, if one borrowed from Milius's "Apocalypse Now" script like other reviewers here have noted. Of course, when the blood flows as thick as it does in the last half-hour of this movie, it's not hard getting and keeping an audience's attention. As a Conan fan, I would have liked more development of the world Conan lived in and the people around him, if not as conceived by Howard at least re-imagined convincingly by Milius. Here you get some visually arresting sets, a rich Basil Poledouris score, and Arnold in his youthful prime, but none of it really comes together, except a little near the end. It's not a bad film, but it's not a world I want to go back to like I do that of Howard's Conan.

    Had heard about this for years but never got an opportunity to view it before now. Turned out to be slightly different from my expectations. It turned out not to have a well-defined plot but more a series of random incidents - at least in the beginning - which somehow lead the protagonist to the ultimate confrontation as if destiny has preordained it. There is also an emphasis on minimal dialogue which works in the film's favour by reducing clunky exposition and making it more of an action-packed visual spectacle. And of course Arnie is not the most lucid English speakers around so it's good that he has so little dialogue. The film is full of gorgeous scenery and production design. II found it to be very different from the usual medieval fantasies - a lot more animalistic and primal, to be exact: notice the heads of animals carved on the ends of each of the arms of the Wheel of Pain and also the snakeskin-like outer walls of the Tower of Serpent. A lot of people have lamented that Conan is made out to be a buffoon which clashes with the source writings. I did not consider it to be a problem within the film. Had Conan had a normal childhood with his parents by his side, there was a chance that he would have turned out to be an erudite and well-balanced individual. But this was not to be. He was forced into slavery and isolation at first and mindless fighting machine later. Doubtless his social skills would not have had much chance to develop. Once free, he passes through the world with a wide-eyed countenance which lends an aspect of apparent buffoonery in some people's eyes. That doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of hilarity and weirdness in the film. The camel-punching scene is, of course, legendary but there are plenty other moments in the film. Why was Conan freed? Why were dogs set upon him afterward? Every time Conan sees something inexplicable, all he can manage to say is, "Crom!" in an awed voice as if it is a final, irrefutable explanation of things. Thulsa Doom and the wizard also provide plenty of entertainment with their restless, manic behaviour. Thulsa Doom's temple reminded me strongly of Col. Kurtz's compound in Apocalypse Now. Since Milius was involved in both films, the connection is intentional, I guess. Max von Sydow appears in only one speaking scene. The lines he is given are not exactly top-class but it is a proof of his brilliance that he makes them sound so good. In the hands of a lesser actor the performance would have been cringe-inducing. All in all, I loved every bit of it. Basil Poledouris's magnificent score towers above everything. It takes its time in setting up the characters and their dilemmas instead of rushing into it in a workmanlike fashion, which was what the sequel did.

    Conan the Barbarian is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie based off a comic book, which I have never read. This movie starts with a monologue about steel which is neat and is referenced to a couple of times later in the movie. We are then introduced to a young Conan living with his family in a tiny little village. Raiders led by the powerful villain Thulsa Doom. Young Conan is spared and used as slave labor, where he grows up into body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan, now a cloud-like adult, is sold into a gladiatorial arena and learns to fight. He soon escapes and proceeds on his journey. This section of the movie features limited dialogue and large amounts of violence and gore, although the gore is very fake. Conan travels far and meets a witch. The witch seduces him and we get to watch them have graphic sex with lots of, um, noises. Conan, however, soon gets tired of witch wench and throws her into a fire, killing her. This is all fun, and Conan leaves a happy man. He meets a friend, who happens to be a thief, steals something from Thulsa Doom's snake cult, and meets the love of his life. He then has graphic sex with the love of his life. The three of them go out on an adventure to take down Thulsa Doom and his evil snake cult. They even meet Max von Sydow playing a king whose daughter was kidnapped by Thulsa Doom. They eventually hunt down Thulsa Doom, with the help of the narrator, a wizard. That brings me to the subject of the villain. In a gore and sex filled cheesy movie that marks one of Arnold's first big American movies, you have James Earl Jones himself as the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom we've talked so much about. James Earl Jones actually gives a memorable, credible performance as the villain. It was rather surprising actually. Thulsa Doom is a frightening villain who uses sorcery and honeyed words to gather completely devoted followers to his cause. The rest of the movie consists of Conan and his friends hunting, and eventually killing, Thulsa Doom. Along the way, Arnold's lover dies, Arnold is crucified on the Tree of Woe, dies, is resurrected, and lights a tower on fire with a perfect throw of a torch. That's about it. It is worth mentioning, however, that the scene where Conan wreaks his revenge on Thulsa Doom is very entertaining, and worth the rest of the movie to see.

    I have watched many times this movie, and it is the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. I have read that some people criticize three things about this movie: First, that the actors are bad, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is wooden . I beg to differ. Conan is a primitive Barbarian Warrior, always circumspect. So, no "laurence Olivier" performances are needed. The interpretation of Arnold Scwarzenegger is precisely what the movie needs, as it conveys a sensation of simplicity and authenticity. Barbarians are not chatty ,witty and funny, but silent, circumspect and primitive. So, Scharzenegger does look the part and is perfect for the movie. We do not need "Stanislawsky Interpretation techniques". It is just Conan. As for other actors, they are OK. People seem to forget that in this movie there are excellent actors: Max Von Sydow, who gives a short but convincing performance as King Osric, and Earl Jones, who gives a good performance as the evil Thulsa Doom. As for the others, they are not brilliant, they are effective, and serve very well the story's needs without unnecessary displays. Second, they say that the action is slow, and that there is not much dialog. Again, dialog is not much needed in this movie, and when it is necessary, it is done by great actors like James Earl Jones. In fact, the fact that there is not much dialog conveys a sensation of reality and authenticity to the movie, even of antiquity. This fact helps us believe that we are actually in a primitive and primordial world. We do not need in Conan chatty characters making jokes to appeal to a poorly cultivated audience and keep the interest of the less cultured and intelligent audience. So, in my opinion, the fact that they do not speak much is a key factor in the success of this movie, as it makes us believe that we are in a primitive, magic, cruel, ancient and primordial world, where action speaks louder than words. In sum, the lack of dialog makes the movie far more credible and authentic. Some other guy said that there is "little violence" in this movie: this is just not true. The movie starts with the burning, pillage and mass extermination and murder of the inhabitants of a whole village, and the children of the village sold as slaves to some northern mercenaries. In this first scenes, a child, the young Conan watches like his own mother is beheaded in front of him. We see how the child still holds his mother's hand when his mother's head is chopped, dismembered, and flying among sprays of blood. The success of this movie is total, and this is because the story is so well told that this is probably the only Sword and Sorcery movie that makes you feel that it all could have happened in a distant primitive world, thousands of years before. This does not happen with other epic films like Lord of the Rings, where you see characters falling from a precipice fighting with dragons, only to be saved in the last minute(therefore, unreal, a stunt designed for young audiences who shout Wow&iexcl;&iexcl; in the cinema). In Conan is very easy to suspend disbelief, and think that all really happened, as the movie conveys a true feeling of authenticity and classicism. Not many movies have done this in this movie genre. Perhaps none. Conan is not actually a movie for children. While we all know that the children of this time are used to see lots more of Violence than Conan's, we all must remember that this is a 1982 movie, made 31-32 years ago. In this movie we see violent murders, beheadings, ritual cannibalism, non consensual sex, mass orgies, prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, ritual suicide, temple profanation,alcoholism, thefts, mass murder, slavery, religious fanaticism, primitive demonic rites, necrophilia, black-magic, magic use of hallucinogenic substances, desecration of tombs, robberies, witchcraft and even hints of homosexuality. So, this is not for Children, as it is Lord of the Rings. Also, here, the characters are not so plain as it appears. In fact, in a movie like Lord of the Rings, the characters are far more plain actually, as they are all "Black & White". This means that the good guys are unbelievably good, and the bad guys unbelievably bad(therefore, unreal). Here, none of the good guys are actually good, and morals are not important. They are described just as they are, and for that reason, all the Conan Characters are incredibly credible, real and authentic. A great Movie, a true legend, with a superb atmosphere. Conan the Barbarian is the story of a revenge, told in epic "friedrich Nietzsche" grandeur. Conan is the incarnation of the myth of the "Super-Human or Super-Man". Thulsa Doom represents religion, superstition, and religious power as a way to control people. Conan, in epic Grandeur, is the wronged man who takes revenge by taking control of his own life by Killing the Demigod Thulsa Doom, beheading him in front of his followers, and throwing his head down the stairs of the temple for the astonishment of his cult followers(it symbolizes the death of god and the coming of the super-man). Then,he burns the temple, and takes the princess with him, being the final scene a "so speaks Zarathustra" epic end, in which a new era, free of the slavery of religion is about to come. Some criticized this anti-Christian or anti-religious ideology. The movie does indeed praise individualism above all, and it does indeed criticize religion. That is also the reason why some saw in the movie some "fascistoid" ideology related to the Master-Slave morality of Friedrich Nietsche.

    i usually don't review a movie unless i feel there is something that must be said. and in this movie there is something like that. do you want deep and long conversations ? yells and roars of battle ? well you came to the wrong place ! in this one they speak short and important, the rest, the viewer must know threw visual and music purely. the visuals which were not too much but not too little, always was completely synced with the exact music and sounds that led us through the movie. but when needed some 'push', a few sentences came but enough to be considered unnoticeable. this movie, which is 2 hours long with some weird sorcery and costumed fighting that most of the time make the viewer(me) unconformable and unwatchable, this one actually make us even more deep in the movie's experience, no matter the age. with this new age of extremely developed CGI technology, there is no need in casting 100 people for a ceremony and action scenes will be much more faster stronger, but they will always miss something that i find very important, sometimes much stronger than the use of CGI, REALITY.

    This is one of the greatest epic films of all times. They don't make 'em like this anymore... Come to think of it they didn't before either. No, this is a one of a kind film. If you can't appreciate this movie perhaps you should stick to books and documentary films. Really, what more can one say? This is one of the greatest epic films of all times.

    Possibly the purest sword-and-sorcery epic ever made, "Conan the Barbarian" finds the eponymous Schwarzenegger orphaned after his parents are slain by the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). Raised in slavery and honed into a bloodthirsty gladiator, Conan embarks on a journey to avenge his parents; one that will see him try his hand at thievery and meet an archer (Gerry Lopez) and a like-minded female robber (Sandahl Bergman). And it would be a kick-ass movie if all of the exciting parts weren't saved for the remaining forty minutes. "Conan the Barbarian" takes more than it's sweet time getting to the thrilling battle scenes that the movie seemed to promise at the start. Admittedly, there are plenty of hallmarks of a great adolescent fantasy sprinkled in the first half: more than a few topless ladies, Schwarzenegger playing the (mostly) silent hulking warrior, his delightfully buff lover (hello, Sandahl Bergman!), and the star even gets to punch out a camel. But it felt like a long slog through molasses until James Earl Jones showed up again. You know Conan's an unparalleled warrior, so why aren't we seeing this guy throw down? For most of the time, he broods more than he fights. And it's not until he goes on the offensive at the bad guy's palace that the swords start flying and the blood really starts to spill. Cue Basil Poledouris to ride in and save the day. Poledouris is the real star of this movie, with a thundering and chest-beating score that keeps you trudging on through the boring parts and catapults you into the sweet end-battle. 5.5/10

    Directed by John Milius, "Conan the Barbarian" is an exaltation of all things barbaric. Some context: Milius is mostly known today for being the basis of Walter Sobchak, the gun-loving right-winger of the Coen Brothers' "Big Lebowski". There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his "hard-right politics", which he lovingly equates with "rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo". Milius' films ("Big Wednesday", "Magnum Force", "Dilinger", "Conan", "Red Dawn" etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing "Dirty Harry", Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because "guns are more honourable than money". "Conan" was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote "Apocalypse Now") salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance. Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. "Conan" doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' "everyman warriors" vs "the evil Other who steals our Freedom" tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist "Private Ryan"). Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - "That which does not kill us makes us stronger" - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of "the will to power", the expression of human existence superior to that of the "conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority". Nietzsche "attacks man's moral principles" such that "the new superman is a law unto himself". He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who "builds himself up into a being beyond the mob". "His secret nobility," Nietzsche then says, "will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists". The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne. So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's "mind and flesh are greater than steel", Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness. Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity  gratuitous in another picture  only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled "Theology/Civilization", has itself become well known in concert circuits. Like "Star Wars" (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy/mythological film which preceded it, "Conan" is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman  who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior  a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells "Conan, what is best in life?", Arnie responds like a caveman: "To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women!" Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - "Do you want to live forever?!" - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies. The film was followed by a worthless sequel. "Conan" itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain. Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was "Red Dawn", essentially Conan with kids. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Arnold has entertained me in many movies over the years (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, Collateral Damage, Eraser), so I can forgive his pitiful acting in this film and just sit back and enjoy it. Of course, the best thing about the film was the presence of Sandahl Bergman, originally a Golddigger from "The Dean Martin Show". She can act and did a very good job of it. I also enjoyed Mako (The Sand Pebbles) and Gerry Lopez, who I guess gave up acting for surfing. It is just a plain guilty pleasure that shows some great sword fighting.
