    The Bridges of Madison County (1995) **** (out of 4) Clint Eastwood does a masterful job adapting the Robert James Waller novel about a lonely Iowa housewife (Meryl Streep) who has a week-long love affair with a photographer (Eastwood) while her family is away. Even though I was just fifteen-years-old, I still remember the confusion when it was announced that a tough guy like Eastwood would be not only acting but directing in what many people considered a woman's film. Whether it was that first viewing or this one, some might be offended that their action star hero would do such a film but it remains one of the greatest works of his career and I think a strong case could be made that a couple scenes are the best directing job he's ever done. I think the film works on many levels but it's certainly a film that deals with regret and I guess a moral question of what's right and wrong is also asked. I thought Eastwood did a terrific job throughout the picture. The first hour of the film is pretty much all dialogue but this is where the two strong lead performances really help. Throughout all the talking you never once get bored because the two actors are simply so great at what they're doing. I think this remains one of the Streep's strongest performances and it's not just for the emotions that she brings to the part. There's also that terrific Italian accent, which remains one of the greatest I've ever heard. The actress just really puts herself into this role and there's no a single second that you don't believe everything you're seeing. Eastwood is also very good in the part and manages to show that he did have a softer side and it's something some of his fans might not like but it proves what a wide range of talent he actually has. The film certainly has some very memorable scenes but there's one in particular, which to me has Eastwood's greatest job at a director and it's towards the end of the film in the rain. There's a sequence at a stop light that I won't ruin but just the emotional impact of this is something I've never forgotten from that first time viewing the film. I think the stuff dealing with the children could have been left on the editing room floor but other than this the film remains every bit as powerful as one would hope for.

    "Robert, I want you to come" Francesca says with an almost pleading tone over the telephone, thus initiating the four-day amour between her and Robert, a travelling photographer on a short trip to Iowa. It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years. This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody. A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big'  it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clich&eacute;d material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber  the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes "This must be Robert Kincaid" even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye. Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a moving commentary on the shades of love. It portrays a beautiful struggle between the currents of Agape and Phileo in defining our relationships, esp the ones we want to last. For the uninitiated, Agape and Phileo are both translated love in English, yet are love of different natures. Agape is a love of choice not conditional on feelings or reciprocity. It is an act of self sacrifice to serve the recipient of our love. Phileo on the other hand is the spark, the 'falling in love' of our times, driven by attraction and pleasant feelings, driven by a sense of certainty of the present emotion, powerful and blinding enough to be willing forget our past commitments and to turn our lives upside down. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for another. Are you in love with your spouse? Or are you at a point where you are telling your spouse, that you have 'fallen in love' with someone else? What shade of love do Francesca and Robert, in the movie, decide as superior? Which shade of love do you think should colour up the portrait of our marriages and our relationships? I guess it all comes down to what values we chose to live by, the temporal and existential, or the eternal and lasting.

    My wife and myself have just watched this film on TCM. We are both in our seventies, and agree nearly completely with the criticisms made of it here in the user reviews, which we usually read after we have watched a film. Interestingly, reading these reviews in chronological order, it seems that the ones over the last few years are nearly all favorable, which says much about present day morals and understanding of mature adult relationships, we think. One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero, but his wife gives it ten, and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women. Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed, even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition, but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her after-death confessions to her children were wicked, and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father, they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her, where they could both then attend the graves of their parents, if they so wished. As has been pointed out many times in these reviews, Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner, and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust, not love. Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship, there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in war-torn Italy. They probably got married in Italy, and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity, not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive, as on his death-bed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband. We give this film a rating of two, because it has stimulated thought and conversation, but to class it as a romance is absurd.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic film that stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep together with Annie Corley, Victor Slezak and Jim Haynie. The screenplay was adapted by Richard LaGravenese and it was directed by Clint Eastwood.The brief, illicit love affair between an Iowa housewife and a post-middle-age free-lance photographer is chronicled in this powerful romance based on the best-selling novella by Robert James Waller. The story begins as globetrotting National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid journeys to Madison County in 1965 to film its lovely covered bridges. Upon his arrival, he stops by an old farmhouse to ask directions. There he encounters housewife, Francesca Johnson, whose spouse and two children are out of town. Thus begins their four-day affair, a liaison that fundamentally changes them both. Later Francesca chronicles the affair in a diary which her flabbergasted grown children read; never would they have expected their mother to be capable of the passion she experienced. The film is sentimental, slow, schmaltzy, and very satisfying. It adapted a bestseller with heft, wit, and grace.Excellent performances by both Eastwood and Streep.Overall,it was superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation as it builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions.

    Photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the life of housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), for four days in the 1960s, changing her life forever. This is a very odd tale. On the surface, it is a story of infidelity, and while the son seems to have a more violent reaction than is probably warranted, he is generally coming from the right point of view. But it is also a tale of romance, passion and more. Viewing from the vantage point of Francesca, we do not really find fault in her actions, even though they are probably wrong. Therein lies the problem of this film... is it justifying adultery? It could be taken that way. But, also, it could be taken as a family story, as Francesca felt that keeping her family safe and together was more important than running away... it is so hard to judge. From within her shoes, could we really say she chose incorrectly?

    "This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime." This quote from the movie, summarizes it all. Plot, quality and story of this movie. It is as fascinating as a fairy tale and yet embraces the reality so dearly that you will feel part of it at all moments. I could not decide, whether its the charm of Eastwood and Streep that brought Charisma to this movie or the simplicity of the story that puts it aside from its genre yet deserving the crown of Love stories. Background scores are apt. I have seen some other directions by Clint, and this one goes no less than those. He has been miraculous whether it comes to acting or to directing. But that does not mean, Meryl is an inch shorter than him in stature. This was my first movie of her. and well I know now why she deserves special credit. To put an end to this review, if you like Love Stories, this is a must watch.

    Seeing movies, especially tragedies that send people to tears, is one of my favorite activities, the best way, when I fell mentally exhausted, to relax deep pressure from heavy studying and to recharge myself spiritually with powerful energy. When eighteen years old, I sent myself a birthday gift, seeing a motion picture, "The Bridges of Madison County " and it has impressed me a lot still now, in the turns of empathy and encouragement. "The Bridges of Madison County" is about the four-day love affair between an Italian woman, married and middle-aged, living in rural America, who had ardent soul long been inactive and a romantic photographer who has been looking for what he really wants. Francesca is absolutely wonderful because of her beautiful face, every smile, every move, and every expression and of being so wise to deal with the dilemma. " I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one." she said. She is everything but a common woman. It seems ridiculous that l get supporting powers from this drama. Like many, loving this movie, fanatical about its scenario, I have not only seen this cinema but also read the novel of the same name again and again. I appreciate Francesca's compromising in the dilemma between ideals and reality and have compassion on her giving up this kind of certainty that comes once in a lifetime. However, a master in English drama tells me "True love is you feel happy when you see she is blessed, even because of someone." Finally, I realize Francesca's hoping her family, save her, in happiness, which is worth her all-out effort. In conclusion, this movie leads me to treasure our family and the bliss we hold in hands and to realize human's affection and emotion more deeply. As a result, I honestly commend everyone to see it, no matter how young she or he is.

    Francesca Johnson (an Italianised Meryl Streep) is an Iowan housewife drifting through life with her farmer husband and two non-communicative teenage children. Like most of us, faced with the realities of life she has set her dreams aside and settled for a drab life of house and farm-work. Then, while her husband and kids are away for a few days, National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (director Clint Eastwood) drives into her life in search of one of the eponymous bridges. Thus begins, a passionate four-day affair that transforms Francesca's outlook on life. I can understand why some would be outraged by the fact that this film asks the audience to sympathise with an unfaithful wife and her lover, but the fact is the film couldn't really succeed if it were any other way. While the story is ostensibly a romantic tearjerker - and it will undoubtedly hit all the right buttons for those who like that sort of thing - I think the film also has a more down to earth message. The fact is, the love that Francesca and Robert share for the remainder of their lives after those four days, would, like all romantic loves, be destined to settle into a less elevated state once familiarity - and the real world, which is rigidly prohibited from impinging on the couple's four days of bliss - set in if she had chosen to abandon her family for him. The ecstatic state of bliss enjoyed by lovers at the beginning of a romance never lasts, and it is the brevity of their encounter that keeps Francesca and Robert's love alive. Whatever your feelings on the matter, the impeccable performances of the two leads can't be denied. Eastwood dispels all memories of his tough guy action man image with his portrait of a man who is perhaps a little too good to be true, while Streep completely inhabits the part of a normal woman who has sacrificed her youthful aspirations for a life of secure mediocrity. The film is perhaps a touch overlong, and the framing device a little clunky, but overall The Bridges of Madison County manages to avoid the pitfalls of a genre that so easily lends itself to over-sentimentalising.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a moving commentary on the shades of love. It portrays a beautiful struggle between the currents of Agape and Phileo in defining our relationships, esp the ones we want to last. For the uninitiated, Agape and Phileo are both translated love in English, yet are love of different natures. Agape is a love of choice not conditional on feelings or reciprocity. It is an act of self sacrifice to serve the recipient of our love. Phileo on the other hand is the spark, the 'falling in love' of our times, driven by attraction and pleasant feelings, driven by a sense of certainty of the present emotion, powerful and blinding enough to be willing forget our past commitments and to turn our lives upside down. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for another. Are you in love with your spouse? Or are you at a point where you are telling your spouse, that you have 'fallen in love' with someone else? What shade of love do Francesca and Robert, in the movie, decide as superior? Which shade of love do you think should colour up the portrait of our marriages and our relationships? I guess it all comes down to what values we chose to live by, the temporal and existential, or the eternal and lasting.

    My wife and myself have just watched this film on TCM. We are both in our seventies, and agree nearly completely with the criticisms made of it here in the user reviews, which we usually read after we have watched a film. Interestingly, reading these reviews in chronological order, it seems that the ones over the last few years are nearly all favorable, which says much about present day morals and understanding of mature adult relationships, we think. One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero, but his wife gives it ten, and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women. Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed, even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition, but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her after-death confessions to her children were wicked, and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father, they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her, where they could both then attend the graves of their parents, if they so wished. As has been pointed out many times in these reviews, Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner, and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust, not love. Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship, there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in war-torn Italy. They probably got married in Italy, and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity, not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive, as on his death-bed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband. We give this film a rating of two, because it has stimulated thought and conversation, but to class it as a romance is absurd.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic film that stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep together with Annie Corley, Victor Slezak and Jim Haynie. The screenplay was adapted by Richard LaGravenese and it was directed by Clint Eastwood.The brief, illicit love affair between an Iowa housewife and a post-middle-age free-lance photographer is chronicled in this powerful romance based on the best-selling novella by Robert James Waller. The story begins as globetrotting National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid journeys to Madison County in 1965 to film its lovely covered bridges. Upon his arrival, he stops by an old farmhouse to ask directions. There he encounters housewife, Francesca Johnson, whose spouse and two children are out of town. Thus begins their four-day affair, a liaison that fundamentally changes them both. Later Francesca chronicles the affair in a diary which her flabbergasted grown children read; never would they have expected their mother to be capable of the passion she experienced. The film is sentimental, slow, schmaltzy, and very satisfying. It adapted a bestseller with heft, wit, and grace.Excellent performances by both Eastwood and Streep.Overall,it was superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation as it builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions.

    Photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the life of housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), for four days in the 1960s, changing her life forever. This is a very odd tale. On the surface, it is a story of infidelity, and while the son seems to have a more violent reaction than is probably warranted, he is generally coming from the right point of view. But it is also a tale of romance, passion and more. Viewing from the vantage point of Francesca, we do not really find fault in her actions, even though they are probably wrong. Therein lies the problem of this film... is it justifying adultery? It could be taken that way. But, also, it could be taken as a family story, as Francesca felt that keeping her family safe and together was more important than running away... it is so hard to judge. From within her shoes, could we really say she chose incorrectly?

    "This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime." This quote from the movie, summarizes it all. Plot, quality and story of this movie. It is as fascinating as a fairy tale and yet embraces the reality so dearly that you will feel part of it at all moments. I could not decide, whether its the charm of Eastwood and Streep that brought Charisma to this movie or the simplicity of the story that puts it aside from its genre yet deserving the crown of Love stories. Background scores are apt. I have seen some other directions by Clint, and this one goes no less than those. He has been miraculous whether it comes to acting or to directing. But that does not mean, Meryl is an inch shorter than him in stature. This was my first movie of her. and well I know now why she deserves special credit. To put an end to this review, if you like Love Stories, this is a must watch.

    Seeing movies, especially tragedies that send people to tears, is one of my favorite activities, the best way, when I fell mentally exhausted, to relax deep pressure from heavy studying and to recharge myself spiritually with powerful energy. When eighteen years old, I sent myself a birthday gift, seeing a motion picture, "The Bridges of Madison County " and it has impressed me a lot still now, in the turns of empathy and encouragement. "The Bridges of Madison County" is about the four-day love affair between an Italian woman, married and middle-aged, living in rural America, who had ardent soul long been inactive and a romantic photographer who has been looking for what he really wants. Francesca is absolutely wonderful because of her beautiful face, every smile, every move, and every expression and of being so wise to deal with the dilemma. " I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one." she said. She is everything but a common woman. It seems ridiculous that l get supporting powers from this drama. Like many, loving this movie, fanatical about its scenario, I have not only seen this cinema but also read the novel of the same name again and again. I appreciate Francesca's compromising in the dilemma between ideals and reality and have compassion on her giving up this kind of certainty that comes once in a lifetime. However, a master in English drama tells me "True love is you feel happy when you see she is blessed, even because of someone." Finally, I realize Francesca's hoping her family, save her, in happiness, which is worth her all-out effort. In conclusion, this movie leads me to treasure our family and the bliss we hold in hands and to realize human's affection and emotion more deeply. As a result, I honestly commend everyone to see it, no matter how young she or he is.

    Francesca Johnson (an Italianised Meryl Streep) is an Iowan housewife drifting through life with her farmer husband and two non-communicative teenage children. Like most of us, faced with the realities of life she has set her dreams aside and settled for a drab life of house and farm-work. Then, while her husband and kids are away for a few days, National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (director Clint Eastwood) drives into her life in search of one of the eponymous bridges. Thus begins, a passionate four-day affair that transforms Francesca's outlook on life. I can understand why some would be outraged by the fact that this film asks the audience to sympathise with an unfaithful wife and her lover, but the fact is the film couldn't really succeed if it were any other way. While the story is ostensibly a romantic tearjerker - and it will undoubtedly hit all the right buttons for those who like that sort of thing - I think the film also has a more down to earth message. The fact is, the love that Francesca and Robert share for the remainder of their lives after those four days, would, like all romantic loves, be destined to settle into a less elevated state once familiarity - and the real world, which is rigidly prohibited from impinging on the couple's four days of bliss - set in if she had chosen to abandon her family for him. The ecstatic state of bliss enjoyed by lovers at the beginning of a romance never lasts, and it is the brevity of their encounter that keeps Francesca and Robert's love alive. Whatever your feelings on the matter, the impeccable performances of the two leads can't be denied. Eastwood dispels all memories of his tough guy action man image with his portrait of a man who is perhaps a little too good to be true, while Streep completely inhabits the part of a normal woman who has sacrificed her youthful aspirations for a life of secure mediocrity. The film is perhaps a touch overlong, and the framing device a little clunky, but overall The Bridges of Madison County manages to avoid the pitfalls of a genre that so easily lends itself to over-sentimentalising.

    Every scene, every moment has a meaning. The means of being a family, The means of real love, choices, friendship.. Faithfulness.. passion..Kids from the part of parents Parents from the part of kids And besides, two great stars acting. The parents can tolerate the kids but on the contrary the children can not be the same towards parent. Every scene is sticked on my mind. Especially the moment that she was struggling in the car..The dining room scenes..There are silent moments giving lots of messages to the public. What can I expect more? An unforgettable experience.. Thank you Clint Eastwood, thank you Meryl Streep.

    The Bridges of Madison County (1995) **** (out of 4) Clint Eastwood does a masterful job adapting the Robert James Waller novel about a lonely Iowa housewife (Meryl Streep) who has a week-long love affair with a photographer (Eastwood) while her family is away. Even though I was just fifteen-years-old, I still remember the confusion when it was announced that a tough guy like Eastwood would be not only acting but directing in what many people considered a woman's film. Whether it was that first viewing or this one, some might be offended that their action star hero would do such a film but it remains one of the greatest works of his career and I think a strong case could be made that a couple scenes are the best directing job he's ever done. I think the film works on many levels but it's certainly a film that deals with regret and I guess a moral question of what's right and wrong is also asked. I thought Eastwood did a terrific job throughout the picture. The first hour of the film is pretty much all dialogue but this is where the two strong lead performances really help. Throughout all the talking you never once get bored because the two actors are simply so great at what they're doing. I think this remains one of the Streep's strongest performances and it's not just for the emotions that she brings to the part. There's also that terrific Italian accent, which remains one of the greatest I've ever heard. The actress just really puts herself into this role and there's no a single second that you don't believe everything you're seeing. Eastwood is also very good in the part and manages to show that he did have a softer side and it's something some of his fans might not like but it proves what a wide range of talent he actually has. The film certainly has some very memorable scenes but there's one in particular, which to me has Eastwood's greatest job at a director and it's towards the end of the film in the rain. There's a sequence at a stop light that I won't ruin but just the emotional impact of this is something I've never forgotten from that first time viewing the film. I think the stuff dealing with the children could have been left on the editing room floor but other than this the film remains every bit as powerful as one would hope for.

    "Robert, I want you to come" Francesca says with an almost pleading tone over the telephone, thus initiating the four-day amour between her and Robert, a travelling photographer on a short trip to Iowa. It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years. This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody. A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big'  it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clich&eacute;d material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber  the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes "This must be Robert Kincaid" even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye. Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.

The film is perhaps a touch overlong, and the framing device a little clunky, but overall The Bridges of Madison County manages to avoid the pitfalls of a genre that so easily lends itself to over-sentimentalising.

    Every scene, every moment has a meaning. The means of being a family, The means of real love, choices, friendship.. Faithfulness.. passion..Kids from the part of parents Parents from the part of kids And besides, two great stars acting. The parents can tolerate the kids but on the contrary the children can not be the same towards parent. Every scene is sticked on my mind. Especially the moment that she was struggling in the car..The dining room scenes..There are silent moments giving lots of messages to the public. What can I expect more? An unforgettable experience.. Thank you Clint Eastwood, thank you Meryl Streep.

    The Bridges of Madison County (1995) **** (out of 4) Clint Eastwood does a masterful job adapting the Robert James Waller novel about a lonely Iowa housewife (Meryl Streep) who has a week-long love affair with a photographer (Eastwood) while her family is away. Even though I was just fifteen-years-old, I still remember the confusion when it was announced that a tough guy like Eastwood would be not only acting but directing in what many people considered a woman's film. Whether it was that first viewing or this one, some might be offended that their action star hero would do such a film but it remains one of the greatest works of his career and I think a strong case could be made that a couple scenes are the best directing job he's ever done. I think the film works on many levels but it's certainly a film that deals with regret and I guess a moral question of what's right and wrong is also asked. I thought Eastwood did a terrific job throughout the picture. The first hour of the film is pretty much all dialogue but this is where the two strong lead performances really help. Throughout all the talking you never once get bored because the two actors are simply so great at what they're doing. I think this remains one of the Streep's strongest performances and it's not just for the emotions that she brings to the part. There's also that terrific Italian accent, which remains one of the greatest I've ever heard. The actress just really puts herself into this role and there's no a single second that you don't believe everything you're seeing. Eastwood is also very good in the part and manages to show that he did have a softer side and it's something some of his fans might not like but it proves what a wide range of talent he actually has. The film certainly has some very memorable scenes but there's one in particular, which to me has Eastwood's greatest job at a director and it's towards the end of the film in the rain. There's a sequence at a stop light that I won't ruin but just the emotional impact of this is something I've never forgotten from that first time viewing the film. I think the stuff dealing with the children could have been left on the editing room floor but other than this the film remains every bit as powerful as one would hope for.

    "Robert, I want you to come" Francesca says with an almost pleading tone over the telephone, thus initiating the four-day amour between her and Robert, a travelling photographer on a short trip to Iowa. It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years. This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody. A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big'  it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clich&eacute;d material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber  the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes "This must be Robert Kincaid" even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye. Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a moving commentary on the shades of love. It portrays a beautiful struggle between the currents of Agape and Phileo in defining our relationships, esp the ones we want to last. For the uninitiated, Agape and Phileo are both translated love in English, yet are love of different natures. Agape is a love of choice not conditional on feelings or reciprocity. It is an act of self sacrifice to serve the recipient of our love. Phileo on the other hand is the spark, the 'falling in love' of our times, driven by attraction and pleasant feelings, driven by a sense of certainty of the present emotion, powerful and blinding enough to be willing forget our past commitments and to turn our lives upside down. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for another. Are you in love with your spouse? Or are you at a point where you are telling your spouse, that you have 'fallen in love' with someone else? What shade of love do Francesca and Robert, in the movie, decide as superior? Which shade of love do you think should colour up the portrait of our marriages and our relationships? I guess it all comes down to what values we chose to live by, the temporal and existential, or the eternal and lasting.

    My wife and myself have just watched this film on TCM. We are both in our seventies, and agree nearly completely with the criticisms made of it here in the user reviews, which we usually read after we have watched a film. Interestingly, reading these reviews in chronological order, it seems that the ones over the last few years are nearly all favorable, which says much about present day morals and understanding of mature adult relationships, we think. One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero, but his wife gives it ten, and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women. Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed, even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition, but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her after-death confessions to her children were wicked, and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father, they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her, where they could both then attend the graves of their parents, if they so wished. As has been pointed out many times in these reviews, Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner, and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust, not love. Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship, there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in war-torn Italy. They probably got married in Italy, and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity, not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive, as on his death-bed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband. We give this film a rating of two, because it has stimulated thought and conversation, but to class it as a romance is absurd.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic film that stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep together with Annie Corley, Victor Slezak and Jim Haynie. The screenplay was adapted by Richard LaGravenese and it was directed by Clint Eastwood.The brief, illicit love affair between an Iowa housewife and a post-middle-age free-lance photographer is chronicled in this powerful romance based on the best-selling novella by Robert James Waller. The story begins as globetrotting National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid journeys to Madison County in 1965 to film its lovely covered bridges. Upon his arrival, he stops by an old farmhouse to ask directions. There he encounters housewife, Francesca Johnson, whose spouse and two children are out of town. Thus begins their four-day affair, a liaison that fundamentally changes them both. Later Francesca chronicles the affair in a diary which her flabbergasted grown children read; never would they have expected their mother to be capable of the passion she experienced. The film is sentimental, slow, schmaltzy, and very satisfying. It adapted a bestseller with heft, wit, and grace.Excellent performances by both Eastwood and Streep.Overall,it was superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation as it builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions.

    Photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the life of housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), for four days in the 1960s, changing her life forever. This is a very odd tale. On the surface, it is a story of infidelity, and while the son seems to have a more violent reaction than is probably warranted, he is generally coming from the right point of view. But it is also a tale of romance, passion and more. Viewing from the vantage point of Francesca, we do not really find fault in her actions, even though they are probably wrong. Therein lies the problem of this film... is it justifying adultery? It could be taken that way. But, also, it could be taken as a family story, as Francesca felt that keeping her family safe and together was more important than running away... it is so hard to judge. From within her shoes, could we really say she chose incorrectly?

    "This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime." This quote from the movie, summarizes it all. Plot, quality and story of this movie. It is as fascinating as a fairy tale and yet embraces the reality so dearly that you will feel part of it at all moments. I could not decide, whether its the charm of Eastwood and Streep that brought Charisma to this movie or the simplicity of the story that puts it aside from its genre yet deserving the crown of Love stories. Background scores are apt. I have seen some other directions by Clint, and this one goes no less than those. He has been miraculous whether it comes to acting or to directing. But that does not mean, Meryl is an inch shorter than him in stature. This was my first movie of her. and well I know now why she deserves special credit. To put an end to this review, if you like Love Stories, this is a must watch.

    Seeing movies, especially tragedies that send people to tears, is one of my favorite activities, the best way, when I fell mentally exhausted, to relax deep pressure from heavy studying and to recharge myself spiritually with powerful energy. When eighteen years old, I sent myself a birthday gift, seeing a motion picture, "The Bridges of Madison County " and it has impressed me a lot still now, in the turns of empathy and encouragement. "The Bridges of Madison County" is about the four-day love affair between an Italian woman, married and middle-aged, living in rural America, who had ardent soul long been inactive and a romantic photographer who has been looking for what he really wants. Francesca is absolutely wonderful because of her beautiful face, every smile, every move, and every expression and of being so wise to deal with the dilemma. " I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one." she said. She is everything but a common woman. It seems ridiculous that l get supporting powers from this drama. Like many, loving this movie, fanatical about its scenario, I have not only seen this cinema but also read the novel of the same name again and again. I appreciate Francesca's compromising in the dilemma between ideals and reality and have compassion on her giving up this kind of certainty that comes once in a lifetime. However, a master in English drama tells me "True love is you feel happy when you see she is blessed, even because of someone." Finally, I realize Francesca's hoping her family, save her, in happiness, which is worth her all-out effort. In conclusion, this movie leads me to treasure our family and the bliss we hold in hands and to realize human's affection and emotion more deeply. As a result, I honestly commend everyone to see it, no matter how young she or he is.

    Francesca Johnson (an Italianised Meryl Streep) is an Iowan housewife drifting through life with her farmer husband and two non-communicative teenage children. Like most of us, faced with the realities of life she has set her dreams aside and settled for a drab life of house and farm-work. Then, while her husband and kids are away for a few days, National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (director Clint Eastwood) drives into her life in search of one of the eponymous bridges. Thus begins, a passionate four-day affair that transforms Francesca's outlook on life. I can understand why some would be outraged by the fact that this film asks the audience to sympathise with an unfaithful wife and her lover, but the fact is the film couldn't really succeed if it were any other way. While the story is ostensibly a romantic tearjerker - and it will undoubtedly hit all the right buttons for those who like that sort of thing - I think the film also has a more down to earth message. The fact is, the love that Francesca and Robert share for the remainder of their lives after those four days, would, like all romantic loves, be destined to settle into a less elevated state once familiarity - and the real world, which is rigidly prohibited from impinging on the couple's four days of bliss - set in if she had chosen to abandon her family for him. The ecstatic state of bliss enjoyed by lovers at the beginning of a romance never lasts, and it is the brevity of their encounter that keeps Francesca and Robert's love alive. Whatever your feelings on the matter, the impeccable performances of the two leads can't be denied. Eastwood dispels all memories of his tough guy action man image with his portrait of a man who is perhaps a little too good to be true, while Streep completely inhabits the part of a normal woman who has sacrificed her youthful aspirations for a life of secure mediocrity. The film is perhaps a touch overlong, and the framing device a little clunky, but overall The Bridges of Madison County manages to avoid the pitfalls of a genre that so easily lends itself to over-sentimentalising.

One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero, but his wife gives it ten, and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women. Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed, even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition, but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her after-death confessions to her children were wicked, and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father, they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her, where they could both then attend the graves of their parents, if they so wished. As has been pointed out many times in these reviews, Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner, and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust, not love. Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship, there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in war-torn Italy. They probably got married in Italy, and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity, not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive, as on his death-bed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband. We give this film a rating of two, because it has stimulated thought and conversation, but to class it as a romance is absurd.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic film that stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep together with Annie Corley, Victor Slezak and Jim Haynie. The screenplay was adapted by Richard LaGravenese and it was directed by Clint Eastwood.The brief, illicit love affair between an Iowa housewife and a post-middle-age free-lance photographer is chronicled in this powerful romance based on the best-selling novella by Robert James Waller. The story begins as globetrotting National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid journeys to Madison County in 1965 to film its lovely covered bridges. Upon his arrival, he stops by an old farmhouse to ask directions. There he encounters housewife, Francesca Johnson, whose spouse and two children are out of town. Thus begins their four-day affair, a liaison that fundamentally changes them both. Later Francesca chronicles the affair in a diary which her flabbergasted grown children read; never would they have expected their mother to be capable of the passion she experienced. The film is sentimental, slow, schmaltzy, and very satisfying. It adapted a bestseller with heft, wit, and grace.Excellent performances by both Eastwood and Streep.Overall,it was superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation as it builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions.

    Photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the life of housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), for four days in the 1960s, changing her life forever. This is a very odd tale. On the surface, it is a story of infidelity, and while the son seems to have a more violent reaction than is probably warranted, he is generally coming from the right point of view. But it is also a tale of romance, passion and more. Viewing from the vantage point of Francesca, we do not really find fault in her actions, even though they are probably wrong. Therein lies the problem of this film... is it justifying adultery? It could be taken that way. But, also, it could be taken as a family story, as Francesca felt that keeping her family safe and together was more important than running away... it is so hard to judge. From within her shoes, could we really say she chose incorrectly?

    "This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime." This quote from the movie, summarizes it all. Plot, quality and story of this movie. It is as fascinating as a fairy tale and yet embraces the reality so dearly that you will feel part of it at all moments. I could not decide, whether its the charm of Eastwood and Streep that brought Charisma to this movie or the simplicity of the story that puts it aside from its genre yet deserving the crown of Love stories. Background scores are apt. I have seen some other directions by Clint, and this one goes no less than those. He has been miraculous whether it comes to acting or to directing. But that does not mean, Meryl is an inch shorter than him in stature. This was my first movie of her. and well I know now why she deserves special credit. To put an end to this review, if you like Love Stories, this is a must watch.

    Seeing movies, especially tragedies that send people to tears, is one of my favorite activities, the best way, when I fell mentally exhausted, to relax deep pressure from heavy studying and to recharge myself spiritually with powerful energy. When eighteen years old, I sent myself a birthday gift, seeing a motion picture, "The Bridges of Madison County " and it has impressed me a lot still now, in the turns of empathy and encouragement. "The Bridges of Madison County" is about the four-day love affair between an Italian woman, married and middle-aged, living in rural America, who had ardent soul long been inactive and a romantic photographer who has been looking for what he really wants. Francesca is absolutely wonderful because of her beautiful face, every smile, every move, and every expression and of being so wise to deal with the dilemma. " I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one." she said. She is everything but a common woman. It seems ridiculous that l get supporting powers from this drama. Like many, loving this movie, fanatical about its scenario, I have not only seen this cinema but also read the novel of the same name again and again. I appreciate Francesca's compromising in the dilemma between ideals and reality and have compassion on her giving up this kind of certainty that comes once in a lifetime. However, a master in English drama tells me "True love is you feel happy when you see she is blessed, even because of someone." Finally, I realize Francesca's hoping her family, save her, in happiness, which is worth her all-out effort. In conclusion, this movie leads me to treasure our family and the bliss we hold in hands and to realize human's affection and emotion more deeply. As a result, I honestly commend everyone to see it, no matter how young she or he is.

    Francesca Johnson (an Italianised Meryl Streep) is an Iowan housewife drifting through life with her farmer husband and two non-communicative teenage children. Like most of us, faced with the realities of life she has set her dreams aside and settled for a drab life of house and farm-work. Then, while her husband and kids are away for a few days, National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (director Clint Eastwood) drives into her life in search of one of the eponymous bridges. Thus begins, a passionate four-day affair that transforms Francesca's outlook on life. I can understand why some would be outraged by the fact that this film asks the audience to sympathise with an unfaithful wife and her lover, but the fact is the film couldn't really succeed if it were any other way. While the story is ostensibly a romantic tearjerker - and it will undoubtedly hit all the right buttons for those who like that sort of thing - I think the film also has a more down to earth message. The fact is, the love that Francesca and Robert share for the remainder of their lives after those four days, would, like all romantic loves, be destined to settle into a less elevated state once familiarity - and the real world, which is rigidly prohibited from impinging on the couple's four days of bliss - set in if she had chosen to abandon her family for him. The ecstatic state of bliss enjoyed by lovers at the beginning of a romance never lasts, and it is the brevity of their encounter that keeps Francesca and Robert's love alive. Whatever your feelings on the matter, the impeccable performances of the two leads can't be denied. Eastwood dispels all memories of his tough guy action man image with his portrait of a man who is perhaps a little too good to be true, while Streep completely inhabits the part of a normal woman who has sacrificed her youthful aspirations for a life of secure mediocrity. The film is perhaps a touch overlong, and the framing device a little clunky, but overall The Bridges of Madison County manages to avoid the pitfalls of a genre that so easily lends itself to over-sentimentalising.

    The Bridges of Madison County (1995) **** (out of 4) Clint Eastwood does a masterful job adapting the Robert James Waller novel about a lonely Iowa housewife (Meryl Streep) who has a week-long love affair with a photographer (Eastwood) while her family is away. Even though I was just fifteen-years-old, I still remember the confusion when it was announced that a tough guy like Eastwood would be not only acting but directing in what many people considered a woman's film. Whether it was that first viewing or this one, some might be offended that their action star hero would do such a film but it remains one of the greatest works of his career and I think a strong case could be made that a couple scenes are the best directing job he's ever done. I think the film works on many levels but it's certainly a film that deals with regret and I guess a moral question of what's right and wrong is also asked. I thought Eastwood did a terrific job throughout the picture. The first hour of the film is pretty much all dialogue but this is where the two strong lead performances really help. Throughout all the talking you never once get bored because the two actors are simply so great at what they're doing. I think this remains one of the Streep's strongest performances and it's not just for the emotions that she brings to the part. There's also that terrific Italian accent, which remains one of the greatest I've ever heard. The actress just really puts herself into this role and there's no a single second that you don't believe everything you're seeing. Eastwood is also very good in the part and manages to show that he did have a softer side and it's something some of his fans might not like but it proves what a wide range of talent he actually has. The film certainly has some very memorable scenes but there's one in particular, which to me has Eastwood's greatest job at a director and it's towards the end of the film in the rain. There's a sequence at a stop light that I won't ruin but just the emotional impact of this is something I've never forgotten from that first time viewing the film. I think the stuff dealing with the children could have been left on the editing room floor but other than this the film remains every bit as powerful as one would hope for.

    "Robert, I want you to come" Francesca says with an almost pleading tone over the telephone, thus initiating the four-day amour between her and Robert, a travelling photographer on a short trip to Iowa. It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years. This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody. A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big'  it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clich&eacute;d material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber  the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes "This must be Robert Kincaid" even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye. Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a moving commentary on the shades of love. It portrays a beautiful struggle between the currents of Agape and Phileo in defining our relationships, esp the ones we want to last. For the uninitiated, Agape and Phileo are both translated love in English, yet are love of different natures. Agape is a love of choice not conditional on feelings or reciprocity. It is an act of self sacrifice to serve the recipient of our love. Phileo on the other hand is the spark, the 'falling in love' of our times, driven by attraction and pleasant feelings, driven by a sense of certainty of the present emotion, powerful and blinding enough to be willing forget our past commitments and to turn our lives upside down. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for another. Are you in love with your spouse? Or are you at a point where you are telling your spouse, that you have 'fallen in love' with someone else? What shade of love do Francesca and Robert, in the movie, decide as superior? Which shade of love do you think should colour up the portrait of our marriages and our relationships? I guess it all comes down to what values we chose to live by, the temporal and existential, or the eternal and lasting.

Even though I was just fifteen-years-old, I still remember the confusion when it was announced that a tough guy like Eastwood would be not only acting but directing in what many people considered a woman's film. Whether it was that first viewing or this one, some might be offended that their action star hero would do such a film but it remains one of the greatest works of his career and I think a strong case could be made that a couple scenes are the best directing job he's ever done. I think the film works on many levels but it's certainly a film that deals with regret and I guess a moral question of what's right and wrong is also asked. I thought Eastwood did a terrific job throughout the picture. The first hour of the film is pretty much all dialogue but this is where the two strong lead performances really help. Throughout all the talking you never once get bored because the two actors are simply so great at what they're doing. I think this remains one of the Streep's strongest performances and it's not just for the emotions that she brings to the part. There's also that terrific Italian accent, which remains one of the greatest I've ever heard. The actress just really puts herself into this role and there's no a single second that you don't believe everything you're seeing. Eastwood is also very good in the part and manages to show that he did have a softer side and it's something some of his fans might not like but it proves what a wide range of talent he actually has. The film certainly has some very memorable scenes but there's one in particular, which to me has Eastwood's greatest job at a director and it's towards the end of the film in the rain. There's a sequence at a stop light that I won't ruin but just the emotional impact of this is something I've never forgotten from that first time viewing the film. I think the stuff dealing with the children could have been left on the editing room floor but other than this the film remains every bit as powerful as one would hope for.

    "Robert, I want you to come" Francesca says with an almost pleading tone over the telephone, thus initiating the four-day amour between her and Robert, a travelling photographer on a short trip to Iowa. It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years. This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody. A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big'  it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clich&eacute;d material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber  the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes "This must be Robert Kincaid" even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye. Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a moving commentary on the shades of love. It portrays a beautiful struggle between the currents of Agape and Phileo in defining our relationships, esp the ones we want to last. For the uninitiated, Agape and Phileo are both translated love in English, yet are love of different natures. Agape is a love of choice not conditional on feelings or reciprocity. It is an act of self sacrifice to serve the recipient of our love. Phileo on the other hand is the spark, the 'falling in love' of our times, driven by attraction and pleasant feelings, driven by a sense of certainty of the present emotion, powerful and blinding enough to be willing forget our past commitments and to turn our lives upside down. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for another. Are you in love with your spouse? Or are you at a point where you are telling your spouse, that you have 'fallen in love' with someone else? What shade of love do Francesca and Robert, in the movie, decide as superior? Which shade of love do you think should colour up the portrait of our marriages and our relationships? I guess it all comes down to what values we chose to live by, the temporal and existential, or the eternal and lasting.

    My wife and myself have just watched this film on TCM. We are both in our seventies, and agree nearly completely with the criticisms made of it here in the user reviews, which we usually read after we have watched a film. Interestingly, reading these reviews in chronological order, it seems that the ones over the last few years are nearly all favorable, which says much about present day morals and understanding of mature adult relationships, we think. One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero, but his wife gives it ten, and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women. Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed, even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition, but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her after-death confessions to her children were wicked, and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father, they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her, where they could both then attend the graves of their parents, if they so wished. As has been pointed out many times in these reviews, Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner, and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust, not love. Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship, there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in war-torn Italy. They probably got married in Italy, and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity, not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive, as on his death-bed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband. We give this film a rating of two, because it has stimulated thought and conversation, but to class it as a romance is absurd.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic film that stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep together with Annie Corley, Victor Slezak and Jim Haynie. The screenplay was adapted by Richard LaGravenese and it was directed by Clint Eastwood.The brief, illicit love affair between an Iowa housewife and a post-middle-age free-lance photographer is chronicled in this powerful romance based on the best-selling novella by Robert James Waller. The story begins as globetrotting National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid journeys to Madison County in 1965 to film its lovely covered bridges. Upon his arrival, he stops by an old farmhouse to ask directions. There he encounters housewife, Francesca Johnson, whose spouse and two children are out of town. Thus begins their four-day affair, a liaison that fundamentally changes them both. Later Francesca chronicles the affair in a diary which her flabbergasted grown children read; never would they have expected their mother to be capable of the passion she experienced. The film is sentimental, slow, schmaltzy, and very satisfying. It adapted a bestseller with heft, wit, and grace.Excellent performances by both Eastwood and Streep.Overall,it was superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation as it builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions.

    Photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the life of housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), for four days in the 1960s, changing her life forever. This is a very odd tale. On the surface, it is a story of infidelity, and while the son seems to have a more violent reaction than is probably warranted, he is generally coming from the right point of view. But it is also a tale of romance, passion and more. Viewing from the vantage point of Francesca, we do not really find fault in her actions, even though they are probably wrong. Therein lies the problem of this film... is it justifying adultery? It could be taken that way. But, also, it could be taken as a family story, as Francesca felt that keeping her family safe and together was more important than running away... it is so hard to judge. From within her shoes, could we really say she chose incorrectly?

    "This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime." This quote from the movie, summarizes it all. Plot, quality and story of this movie. It is as fascinating as a fairy tale and yet embraces the reality so dearly that you will feel part of it at all moments. I could not decide, whether its the charm of Eastwood and Streep that brought Charisma to this movie or the simplicity of the story that puts it aside from its genre yet deserving the crown of Love stories. Background scores are apt. I have seen some other directions by Clint, and this one goes no less than those. He has been miraculous whether it comes to acting or to directing. But that does not mean, Meryl is an inch shorter than him in stature. This was my first movie of her. and well I know now why she deserves special credit. To put an end to this review, if you like Love Stories, this is a must watch.

    Seeing movies, especially tragedies that send people to tears, is one of my favorite activities, the best way, when I fell mentally exhausted, to relax deep pressure from heavy studying and to recharge myself spiritually with powerful energy. When eighteen years old, I sent myself a birthday gift, seeing a motion picture, "The Bridges of Madison County " and it has impressed me a lot still now, in the turns of empathy and encouragement. "The Bridges of Madison County" is about the four-day love affair between an Italian woman, married and middle-aged, living in rural America, who had ardent soul long been inactive and a romantic photographer who has been looking for what he really wants. Francesca is absolutely wonderful because of her beautiful face, every smile, every move, and every expression and of being so wise to deal with the dilemma. " I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one." she said. She is everything but a common woman. It seems ridiculous that l get supporting powers from this drama. Like many, loving this movie, fanatical about its scenario, I have not only seen this cinema but also read the novel of the same name again and again. I appreciate Francesca's compromising in the dilemma between ideals and reality and have compassion on her giving up this kind of certainty that comes once in a lifetime. However, a master in English drama tells me "True love is you feel happy when you see she is blessed, even because of someone." Finally, I realize Francesca's hoping her family, save her, in happiness, which is worth her all-out effort. In conclusion, this movie leads me to treasure our family and the bliss we hold in hands and to realize human's affection and emotion more deeply. As a result, I honestly commend everyone to see it, no matter how young she or he is.

    Francesca Johnson (an Italianised Meryl Streep) is an Iowan housewife drifting through life with her farmer husband and two non-communicative teenage children. Like most of us, faced with the realities of life she has set her dreams aside and settled for a drab life of house and farm-work. Then, while her husband and kids are away for a few days, National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (director Clint Eastwood) drives into her life in search of one of the eponymous bridges. Thus begins, a passionate four-day affair that transforms Francesca's outlook on life. I can understand why some would be outraged by the fact that this film asks the audience to sympathise with an unfaithful wife and her lover, but the fact is the film couldn't really succeed if it were any other way. While the story is ostensibly a romantic tearjerker - and it will undoubtedly hit all the right buttons for those who like that sort of thing - I think the film also has a more down to earth message. The fact is, the love that Francesca and Robert share for the remainder of their lives after those four days, would, like all romantic loves, be destined to settle into a less elevated state once familiarity - and the real world, which is rigidly prohibited from impinging on the couple's four days of bliss - set in if she had chosen to abandon her family for him. The ecstatic state of bliss enjoyed by lovers at the beginning of a romance never lasts, and it is the brevity of their encounter that keeps Francesca and Robert's love alive. Whatever your feelings on the matter, the impeccable performances of the two leads can't be denied. Eastwood dispels all memories of his tough guy action man image with his portrait of a man who is perhaps a little too good to be true, while Streep completely inhabits the part of a normal woman who has sacrificed her youthful aspirations for a life of secure mediocrity. The film is perhaps a touch overlong, and the framing device a little clunky, but overall The Bridges of Madison County manages to avoid the pitfalls of a genre that so easily lends itself to over-sentimentalising.

    Every scene, every moment has a meaning. The means of being a family, The means of real love, choices, friendship.. Faithfulness.. passion..Kids from the part of parents Parents from the part of kids And besides, two great stars acting. The parents can tolerate the kids but on the contrary the children can not be the same towards parent. Every scene is sticked on my mind. Especially the moment that she was struggling in the car..The dining room scenes..There are silent moments giving lots of messages to the public. What can I expect more? An unforgettable experience.. Thank you Clint Eastwood, thank you Meryl Streep.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic film that stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep together with Annie Corley, Victor Slezak and Jim Haynie. The screenplay was adapted by Richard LaGravenese and it was directed by Clint Eastwood.The brief, illicit love affair between an Iowa housewife and a post-middle-age free-lance photographer is chronicled in this powerful romance based on the best-selling novella by Robert James Waller. The story begins as globetrotting National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid journeys to Madison County in 1965 to film its lovely covered bridges. Upon his arrival, he stops by an old farmhouse to ask directions. There he encounters housewife, Francesca Johnson, whose spouse and two children are out of town. Thus begins their four-day affair, a liaison that fundamentally changes them both. Later Francesca chronicles the affair in a diary which her flabbergasted grown children read; never would they have expected their mother to be capable of the passion she experienced. The film is sentimental, slow, schmaltzy, and very satisfying. It adapted a bestseller with heft, wit, and grace.Excellent performances by both Eastwood and Streep.Overall,it was superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation as it builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions.

    Photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the life of housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), for four days in the 1960s, changing her life forever. This is a very odd tale. On the surface, it is a story of infidelity, and while the son seems to have a more violent reaction than is probably warranted, he is generally coming from the right point of view. But it is also a tale of romance, passion and more. Viewing from the vantage point of Francesca, we do not really find fault in her actions, even though they are probably wrong. Therein lies the problem of this film... is it justifying adultery? It could be taken that way. But, also, it could be taken as a family story, as Francesca felt that keeping her family safe and together was more important than running away... it is so hard to judge. From within her shoes, could we really say she chose incorrectly?

    "This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime." This quote from the movie, summarizes it all. Plot, quality and story of this movie. It is as fascinating as a fairy tale and yet embraces the reality so dearly that you will feel part of it at all moments. I could not decide, whether its the charm of Eastwood and Streep that brought Charisma to this movie or the simplicity of the story that puts it aside from its genre yet deserving the crown of Love stories. Background scores are apt. I have seen some other directions by Clint, and this one goes no less than those. He has been miraculous whether it comes to acting or to directing. But that does not mean, Meryl is an inch shorter than him in stature. This was my first movie of her. and well I know now why she deserves special credit. To put an end to this review, if you like Love Stories, this is a must watch.

    Seeing movies, especially tragedies that send people to tears, is one of my favorite activities, the best way, when I fell mentally exhausted, to relax deep pressure from heavy studying and to recharge myself spiritually with powerful energy. When eighteen years old, I sent myself a birthday gift, seeing a motion picture, "The Bridges of Madison County " and it has impressed me a lot still now, in the turns of empathy and encouragement. "The Bridges of Madison County" is about the four-day love affair between an Italian woman, married and middle-aged, living in rural America, who had ardent soul long been inactive and a romantic photographer who has been looking for what he really wants. Francesca is absolutely wonderful because of her beautiful face, every smile, every move, and every expression and of being so wise to deal with the dilemma. " I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one." she said. She is everything but a common woman. It seems ridiculous that l get supporting powers from this drama. Like many, loving this movie, fanatical about its scenario, I have not only seen this cinema but also read the novel of the same name again and again. I appreciate Francesca's compromising in the dilemma between ideals and reality and have compassion on her giving up this kind of certainty that comes once in a lifetime. However, a master in English drama tells me "True love is you feel happy when you see she is blessed, even because of someone." Finally, I realize Francesca's hoping her family, save her, in happiness, which is worth her all-out effort. In conclusion, this movie leads me to treasure our family and the bliss we hold in hands and to realize human's affection and emotion more deeply. As a result, I honestly commend everyone to see it, no matter how young she or he is.

    Francesca Johnson (an Italianised Meryl Streep) is an Iowan housewife drifting through life with her farmer husband and two non-communicative teenage children. Like most of us, faced with the realities of life she has set her dreams aside and settled for a drab life of house and farm-work. Then, while her husband and kids are away for a few days, National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (director Clint Eastwood) drives into her life in search of one of the eponymous bridges. Thus begins, a passionate four-day affair that transforms Francesca's outlook on life. I can understand why some would be outraged by the fact that this film asks the audience to sympathise with an unfaithful wife and her lover, but the fact is the film couldn't really succeed if it were any other way. While the story is ostensibly a romantic tearjerker - and it will undoubtedly hit all the right buttons for those who like that sort of thing - I think the film also has a more down to earth message. The fact is, the love that Francesca and Robert share for the remainder of their lives after those four days, would, like all romantic loves, be destined to settle into a less elevated state once familiarity - and the real world, which is rigidly prohibited from impinging on the couple's four days of bliss - set in if she had chosen to abandon her family for him. The ecstatic state of bliss enjoyed by lovers at the beginning of a romance never lasts, and it is the brevity of their encounter that keeps Francesca and Robert's love alive. Whatever your feelings on the matter, the impeccable performances of the two leads can't be denied. Eastwood dispels all memories of his tough guy action man image with his portrait of a man who is perhaps a little too good to be true, while Streep completely inhabits the part of a normal woman who has sacrificed her youthful aspirations for a life of secure mediocrity. The film is perhaps a touch overlong, and the framing device a little clunky, but overall The Bridges of Madison County manages to avoid the pitfalls of a genre that so easily lends itself to over-sentimentalising.

    The Bridges of Madison County (1995) **** (out of 4) Clint Eastwood does a masterful job adapting the Robert James Waller novel about a lonely Iowa housewife (Meryl Streep) who has a week-long love affair with a photographer (Eastwood) while her family is away. Even though I was just fifteen-years-old, I still remember the confusion when it was announced that a tough guy like Eastwood would be not only acting but directing in what many people considered a woman's film. Whether it was that first viewing or this one, some might be offended that their action star hero would do such a film but it remains one of the greatest works of his career and I think a strong case could be made that a couple scenes are the best directing job he's ever done. I think the film works on many levels but it's certainly a film that deals with regret and I guess a moral question of what's right and wrong is also asked. I thought Eastwood did a terrific job throughout the picture. The first hour of the film is pretty much all dialogue but this is where the two strong lead performances really help. Throughout all the talking you never once get bored because the two actors are simply so great at what they're doing. I think this remains one of the Streep's strongest performances and it's not just for the emotions that she brings to the part. There's also that terrific Italian accent, which remains one of the greatest I've ever heard. The actress just really puts herself into this role and there's no a single second that you don't believe everything you're seeing. Eastwood is also very good in the part and manages to show that he did have a softer side and it's something some of his fans might not like but it proves what a wide range of talent he actually has. The film certainly has some very memorable scenes but there's one in particular, which to me has Eastwood's greatest job at a director and it's towards the end of the film in the rain. There's a sequence at a stop light that I won't ruin but just the emotional impact of this is something I've never forgotten from that first time viewing the film. I think the stuff dealing with the children could have been left on the editing room floor but other than this the film remains every bit as powerful as one would hope for.

    "Robert, I want you to come" Francesca says with an almost pleading tone over the telephone, thus initiating the four-day amour between her and Robert, a travelling photographer on a short trip to Iowa. It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years. This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody. A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big'  it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clich&eacute;d material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber  the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes "This must be Robert Kincaid" even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye. Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a moving commentary on the shades of love. It portrays a beautiful struggle between the currents of Agape and Phileo in defining our relationships, esp the ones we want to last. For the uninitiated, Agape and Phileo are both translated love in English, yet are love of different natures. Agape is a love of choice not conditional on feelings or reciprocity. It is an act of self sacrifice to serve the recipient of our love. Phileo on the other hand is the spark, the 'falling in love' of our times, driven by attraction and pleasant feelings, driven by a sense of certainty of the present emotion, powerful and blinding enough to be willing forget our past commitments and to turn our lives upside down. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for another. Are you in love with your spouse? Or are you at a point where you are telling your spouse, that you have 'fallen in love' with someone else? What shade of love do Francesca and Robert, in the movie, decide as superior? Which shade of love do you think should colour up the portrait of our marriages and our relationships? I guess it all comes down to what values we chose to live by, the temporal and existential, or the eternal and lasting.

    My wife and myself have just watched this film on TCM. We are both in our seventies, and agree nearly completely with the criticisms made of it here in the user reviews, which we usually read after we have watched a film. Interestingly, reading these reviews in chronological order, it seems that the ones over the last few years are nearly all favorable, which says much about present day morals and understanding of mature adult relationships, we think. One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero, but his wife gives it ten, and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women. Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed, even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition, but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her after-death confessions to her children were wicked, and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father, they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her, where they could both then attend the graves of their parents, if they so wished. As has been pointed out many times in these reviews, Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner, and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust, not love. Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship, there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in war-torn Italy. They probably got married in Italy, and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity, not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive, as on his death-bed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband. We give this film a rating of two, because it has stimulated thought and conversation, but to class it as a romance is absurd.

    "Robert, I want you to come" Francesca says with an almost pleading tone over the telephone, thus initiating the four-day amour between her and Robert, a travelling photographer on a short trip to Iowa. It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years. This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody. A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big'  it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clich&eacute;d material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber  the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes "This must be Robert Kincaid" even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye. Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a moving commentary on the shades of love. It portrays a beautiful struggle between the currents of Agape and Phileo in defining our relationships, esp the ones we want to last. For the uninitiated, Agape and Phileo are both translated love in English, yet are love of different natures. Agape is a love of choice not conditional on feelings or reciprocity. It is an act of self sacrifice to serve the recipient of our love. Phileo on the other hand is the spark, the 'falling in love' of our times, driven by attraction and pleasant feelings, driven by a sense of certainty of the present emotion, powerful and blinding enough to be willing forget our past commitments and to turn our lives upside down. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for another. Are you in love with your spouse? Or are you at a point where you are telling your spouse, that you have 'fallen in love' with someone else? What shade of love do Francesca and Robert, in the movie, decide as superior? Which shade of love do you think should colour up the portrait of our marriages and our relationships? I guess it all comes down to what values we chose to live by, the temporal and existential, or the eternal and lasting.

    My wife and myself have just watched this film on TCM. We are both in our seventies, and agree nearly completely with the criticisms made of it here in the user reviews, which we usually read after we have watched a film. Interestingly, reading these reviews in chronological order, it seems that the ones over the last few years are nearly all favorable, which says much about present day morals and understanding of mature adult relationships, we think. One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero, but his wife gives it ten, and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women. Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed, even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition, but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her after-death confessions to her children were wicked, and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father, they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her, where they could both then attend the graves of their parents, if they so wished. As has been pointed out many times in these reviews, Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner, and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust, not love. Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship, there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in war-torn Italy. They probably got married in Italy, and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity, not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive, as on his death-bed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband. We give this film a rating of two, because it has stimulated thought and conversation, but to class it as a romance is absurd.

    The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic film that stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep together with Annie Corley, Victor Slezak and Jim Haynie. The screenplay was adapted by Richard LaGravenese and it was directed by Clint Eastwood.The brief, illicit love affair between an Iowa housewife and a post-middle-age free-lance photographer is chronicled in this powerful romance based on the best-selling novella by Robert James Waller. The story begins as globetrotting National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid journeys to Madison County in 1965 to film its lovely covered bridges. Upon his arrival, he stops by an old farmhouse to ask directions. There he encounters housewife, Francesca Johnson, whose spouse and two children are out of town. Thus begins their four-day affair, a liaison that fundamentally changes them both. Later Francesca chronicles the affair in a diary which her flabbergasted grown children read; never would they have expected their mother to be capable of the passion she experienced. The film is sentimental, slow, schmaltzy, and very satisfying. It adapted a bestseller with heft, wit, and grace.Excellent performances by both Eastwood and Streep.Overall,it was superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation as it builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions.

    Photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the life of housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), for four days in the 1960s, changing her life forever. This is a very odd tale. On the surface, it is a story of infidelity, and while the son seems to have a more violent reaction than is probably warranted, he is generally coming from the right point of view. But it is also a tale of romance, passion and more. Viewing from the vantage point of Francesca, we do not really find fault in her actions, even though they are probably wrong. Therein lies the problem of this film... is it justifying adultery? It could be taken that way. But, also, it could be taken as a family story, as Francesca felt that keeping her family safe and together was more important than running away... it is so hard to judge. From within her shoes, could we really say she chose incorrectly?

    "This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime." This quote from the movie, summarizes it all. Plot, quality and story of this movie. It is as fascinating as a fairy tale and yet embraces the reality so dearly that you will feel part of it at all moments. I could not decide, whether its the charm of Eastwood and Streep that brought Charisma to this movie or the simplicity of the story that puts it aside from its genre yet deserving the crown of Love stories. Background scores are apt. I have seen some other directions by Clint, and this one goes no less than those. He has been miraculous whether it comes to acting or to directing. But that does not mean, Meryl is an inch shorter than him in stature. This was my first movie of her. and well I know now why she deserves special credit. To put an end to this review, if you like Love Stories, this is a must watch.

    Seeing movies, especially tragedies that send people to tears, is one of my favorite activities, the best way, when I fell mentally exhausted, to relax deep pressure from heavy studying and to recharge myself spiritually with powerful energy. When eighteen years old, I sent myself a birthday gift, seeing a motion picture, "The Bridges of Madison County " and it has impressed me a lot still now, in the turns of empathy and encouragement. "The Bridges of Madison County" is about the four-day love affair between an Italian woman, married and middle-aged, living in rural America, who had ardent soul long been inactive and a romantic photographer who has been looking for what he really wants. Francesca is absolutely wonderful because of her beautiful face, every smile, every move, and every expression and of being so wise to deal with the dilemma. " I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one." she said. She is everything but a common woman. It seems ridiculous that l get supporting powers from this drama. Like many, loving this movie, fanatical about its scenario, I have not only seen this cinema but also read the novel of the same name again and again. I appreciate Francesca's compromising in the dilemma between ideals and reality and have compassion on her giving up this kind of certainty that comes once in a lifetime. However, a master in English drama tells me "True love is you feel happy when you see she is blessed, even because of someone." Finally, I realize Francesca's hoping her family, save her, in happiness, which is worth her all-out effort. In conclusion, this movie leads me to treasure our family and the bliss we hold in hands and to realize human's affection and emotion more deeply. As a result, I honestly commend everyone to see it, no matter how young she or he is.

    This Kind of Certainty Comes But Once in a Lifetime

    Francesca Johnson (an Italianised Meryl Streep) is an Iowan housewife drifting through life with her farmer husband and two non-communicative teenage children. Like most of us, faced with the realities of life she has set her dreams aside and settled for a drab life of house and farm-work. Then, while her husband and kids are away for a few days, National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (director Clint Eastwood) drives into her life in search of one of the eponymous bridges. Thus begins, a passionate four-day affair that transforms Francesca's outlook on life. I can understand why some would be outraged by the fact that this film asks the audience to sympathise with an unfaithful wife and her lover, but the fact is the film couldn't really succeed if it were any other way. While the story is ostensibly a romantic tearjerker - and it will undoubtedly hit all the right buttons for those who like that sort of thing - I think the film also has a more down to earth message. The fact is, the love that Francesca and Robert share for the remainder of their lives after those four days, would, like all romantic loves, be destined to settle into a less elevated state once familiarity - and the real world, which is rigidly prohibited from impinging on the couple's four days of bliss - set in if she had chosen to abandon her family for him. The ecstatic state of bliss enjoyed by lovers at the beginning of a romance never lasts, and it is the brevity of their encounter that keeps Francesca and Robert's love alive. Whatever your feelings on the matter, the impeccable performances of the two leads can't be denied. Eastwood dispels all memories of his tough guy action man image with his portrait of a man who is perhaps a little too good to be true, while Streep completely inhabits the part of a normal woman who has sacrificed her youthful aspirations for a life of secure mediocrity. The film is perhaps a touch overlong, and the framing device a little clunky, but overall The Bridges of Madison County manages to avoid the pitfalls of a genre that so easily lends itself to over-sentimentalising.
