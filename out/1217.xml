    Antonio Banderas is outstanding in this movie and no one has put this in his resume. He was great!! He stole the show from Stallone. Great actor love his craziness!! Antonio kicked butt!! One of the best action movies and never mentioned as a top rated movie. Beats a lot of movies these days. Today is nothing like yesterday!! I would love to see Stallone and Banderas in another movie together there was great chemistry. I hope there are other viewers who agree with me on this. I'm hoping to stop writing now but the guidelines saying i need more text! i hope they will now take this or i will scream!Okay i'm screaming now i have nothing else to write-hello. OMG finally!!!

    This movie is great if your looking for an action thriller featuring famous faces and great performances.Let's start with the famous Rocky star. Sylvester Stallone gives a good performance as a contract assassin who wants out. He performs the role well, and works well with his co- stars Julianne Moore and Antonio Banderas. Julianne Moore gives a good performance as the love interest to Stallone's character. She performs the role with emotion and does a respectable job of it. Now, when I watched this film recently all I thought of was how amazing Antonio Banderas performed his role as the arch-nemesis of Stallone's character. Banderas did an excellent job on his character, he performed it with depth, emotion and wit. His performance was convincing and made the movie that much better for me. He was the star of the movie even though he wasn't meant to be the star of the movie. He out acts Stallone and Moore, he makes the movie what it is with his memorable performance as Bain, it reminds me very much of how Heath Ledger was a key to the success of the Dark Knight. Banderas was key the the movies success, but overall it was a good movie with great characters. And great performances from a star cast.

    The Macguffin is a computer disk possessed by Moore who is a computer jock who does shakedowns of shady people, but this time she has downloaded and attempted to blackmail a quarry she should have left alone. Stallone, a professional assassin who gets his instructions from an anonymous computer source, is called in to get a mark, some right-wing South American figure, but he's ready to retire. Just when Stallone's about to assassinate him at a funeral, a competing assassin, Banderas, appears, and takes the contract. Stallone knows that he is being targeted, so on his next assignment, which is Moore and the disk, he reneges when Banderas again appears. Well-staged chases and close escapes ensue, in several locations. We also are treated to love developing between Stallone and Moore, who are initially antagonists. Donner's sure directing hand gives us a smooth result. Stallone and Moore stand out. Banderas' character is a clich&eacute;, namely, a competitive, hot-tempered, macho Latin man who wants to be number one. Each sequence in the movie is well-developed, especially the climactic scenes on a Caribbean island that involve a deteriorating hotel. The script develops character mainly through action and plot development, so that it engages viewers. A good show overall that made me realize that assassins are vulnerable to being assassinated because they know where the bodies are. The only way to prevent the threat of himself being killed is not to know who or where the orders come from. Stallone has that arrangement, and even that turns out to be dangerous.

    Director Richard Donner helms this action-adventure yarn in which Robert Rath,portrayed by Sylvester Stallone, a veteran, burned-out hit man for hire who's looking to leave his profession, meets a younger, crazier, more ambitious competitor, Miguel Bain,played by Antonio Banderas, who is out to best Rath and make him a target in the process in this movie,Assassins. Julianne Moore co-stars in this film written by Andy and Larry Wachowski together with Brian Helgeland. Rath signs on for one last hit, but complications ensue when he falls in love with the mark, a beautiful, mysterious woman named Electra. Bain sets out to murder Electra as well.The two are competing to hit the same target for a $20-million payoff, and their challenge takes them from explosion to explosion on a cat-and-mouse chase from Seattle to Mexico and the chase leads the two assassins into a deadly game of wits. Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas seem as if they didn't know quite what to do to make this implausible action drama a kick.As for the screenplay,the plot becomes increasingly silly, and while some pleasure can be had in the improbable set pieces, this is not nearly as much fun as it should be.But nevertheless,Richard Donner managed to give this movie a style as he handles action sequences with adequate flair and has a good time blowing things up.Overall,it manages to become a guilty pleasure especially for viewers who love action thrillers.

    Richard Donner's 'Assassins' is Time-Pass! A Fast-Paced, Edgy Action Flick, that works, along-with with winning performances. 'Assassins' Synopsis: Robert Rath is a seasoned hit-man who just wants out of the business with no back talk. But, as things go, it ain't so easy. A younger, peppier assassin named Bain is having a field day trying to kill said older assassin. Rath teams up with a computer hacker named Electra to defeat the obsessed Bain. 'Assassins' is Fast-Paced & Edgy, and it gets it right on more than just one occasion. Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski & Brian Helgeland's Screenplay is entertaining & well-paced. Richard Donner's Direction is as good as ever. Cinematography is fair. Editing is passable. Performance-Wise: Stallone is super, as always. Antonio Banderas is a terrific actor & he proves that fact right once again with 'Assassins'. He plays the heartless villain to perfection. Julianne Moore looks a million bucks & performs with her usual style. Anatoly Davydov is alright. On the whole, 'Assassins' is worth a look.

    Assassins is a top notch, big budget thriller that is often over looked when discussing Stallone's filmography. Which is a shame, cause it's one of Sly's better films and his performance as an aging burn out hit-man is quite solid. Antonio Banderas really steals the show though as the over the top and cocky newcomer who idolizes Stallone's character. Banderas is full of energy and his performance is electric. Miguel Bain is one of Banderas' best roles. An all time great movie villain perhaps. Many fans forget about Stallone's solid output in the 90's, Cliffhanger is always mentioned but Assassins seems to be forgotten. It's a slick and explosive action thriller from "Lethal Weapon" director Donner. Featuring some great dialog and shoot outs between Stallone and Banderas. On the negative side, the film is too long. Running over 2 hours, "Assassins" begins to wear out it's welcome. And the love story between Moore and Stallone is too cheesy and unrealistic to be taken seriously. Like "Daylight" and "Copland", "Assassins" is one of Stallone's most underrated films from the 90's. An over looked gem that deserves to be seen again.

    A mid-Nineties action film starring Sylvester Stallone and directed by the helmer of the "Lethal Weapon" series hardly sounds like a recipe for greatness, does it? It's not the sort of the film that troubles award committees or quickens the heart-rate of critics. But audiences lap these sort of films up and especially guys who enjoy explosions and gun fights and various macho activities. Which I do but this effort never really steps it up and seems perfectly happy to remain in third gear without getting anywhere near top speed. Professional hit-man Robert Rath (Stallone) is looking to get out of the game as age starts to catch up with him. After he misses out on a contract thanks to rival Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), Rath is offered a shot at $2 million. The target is an anonymous electronics whiz (Julianne Moore) who's trying to arrange a deal with some shady Dutch types in Seattle. But Bain is never far behind and as Rath begins to question his orders, both of their lives are in danger. Stallone, looking much younger on the film's poster than he does in the movie, is a strangely monotone hero (if you can call someone who kills or money a hero) and at no point do you feel, support or root for him. Banderas is much more engaging but this is because he's an evil equivalent of El Mariachi from "Desperado". Gun in each hand and hair in front of his face, you know the look. Anyway, the pair of them tear through the scenery with plenty of gusto and the action is satisfying enough even if it is a little old-school. The plot is pretty formulaic and predictable - in fact, the only real surprise is the lack of a sex scene. So far, so what? It couldn't be any more average if it wanted to be but "Assassins" does have a couple of interesting trivia points. The script, written and then disowned by the Wachowski brothers (creators of the first 21st century action movie "The Matrix"), isn't as bad as they reckon but it doesn't offer anything new or different. The director, Richard Donner, knows his stuff when it comes to the action genre but it doesn't feel like a quality product - all the guns sound silenced for some reason and there is an explosion which is badly imposed on the footage and gives the sense of a budget being ran dry. I also can't figure out why they paid Stallone such a vast sum of money for his performance because for $15 million, I'd at least expect a flicker of emotion or some facial movement. But the only things that move on Stallone's head are his eyes and lips and personally, I wonder if the Wachowski's disowned the script after they'd seen the movie.

    This movie is really about removing that which is old to replace it with something that is new. Robert (Sylvester Stallone) is an assassin working for the US government. Fifteen years previously he assassinated his mentor Nicholai as he was leaving a bank so that he could become number one. Now a younger assassin, Miguel (Antonio Banderas) has appeared and he wants Robert's position. This movie is an action movie and is quite good. Donner creates a very dreamlike feel to the movie, which possibly means that what we have is not always going to be there. Personally that is just a wild guess. The bigger theme in the movie is the fear that somebody younger will appear that is much better than you and thus making you obsolete. The world in the movie is one of assassins, but this is very much true in the business world where the older people have to keep on their toes with the younger executives who want their job. Then there are the conservative established companies who are being challenged by the new innovative companies. Assassins portrays life, a life where we must watch out for the ambitious coming up from below us and remain alert as they attempt to take from us the position that they want. Yet there is also a time when we want to retire, when we wish to give up, and the thing assassins says is that we can never retire because even if we give up the race, the race always seeks to come along and forcefully remove us. Assassins is done in a dreamlike state because it is a reflection of the world in which we live.

    Howard Hawks allegedly said of his film "Rio Bravo" that "we enjoyed making it so much that we made it again". He was, of course, referring to "El Dorado" which although it is not officially a remake of "Rio Bravo" shares with it a very similar plot and the same leading man, John Wayne. Hawks and Wayne were later to make the same film for a third time, this time under the title "Rio Lobo". It would appear that, with six "Rockies" and four "Rambos" under his belt, Sylvester Stallone also enjoys making the same film several times. His 1994 outing, "The Specialist", never generated a franchise in this way, possibly because it was given a deservedly hostile reception by the critics. He did, however, follow it up the following year with the very similar "Assassins" which can be regarded as an unacknowledged remake. In both films Stallone plays hit-men who earn their living by murdering people, the main difference that Ray Quick from "The Specialist" prefers to use explosives, whereas Robert Rath, Sly's character here, uses a gun as his weapon of choice. Now you might think that this would make them the villains of the piece, but both are in fact treated as the heroes of their respective films. Hollywood has often tended to romanticise professional assassins, the more recent Bradgelina love-fest "Mr. and Mrs Smith" being a good example, and Messrs Quick and Rath can both be regarded as Good Murderers to whom falls the task of protecting the innocent from Bad Murderers. (In between "The Specialist" and "Assassins", Sly had made "Judge Dredd", in which he plays another type of Good Murderer). In "Assassins" the Bad Murderer is Miguel Bain, a rival hit-man even more ruthless than Rath himself. When Rath discovers that both he and Bain have been assigned by their "contractor" to kill the same "mark", a computer hacker named Electra, he has a change of heart and decides to protect her from Bain. Similarly in "The Specialist" Stallone found himself trying to protect an attractive girl, played there by Sharon Stone, from the attentions of another Bad Murderer (James Woods). Despite Rath's change of heart, the difference between him and Bain, as far as their code of ethics is concerned, is really only paper-thin. Perhaps it was for this reason that Stallone and Antonio Banderas, who plays Bain, decided to make their characters as different as possible in terms of styles of acting. Banderas plays Bain as an aggressive, cocky and hyper-active loudmouth, the sort of man the audience would loathe even if he were not a vicious killer. Rath, by contrast, is quiet, reserved and stony-faced. Rath's main motivation is financial, whereas Bain is obsessed with the psychological need to prove himself a better assassin than the older, more experienced Rath. (The idea of crime as a competitive sport is a common one in the cinema, another example being "Ocean's Twelve" which features a criminal whose motive for committing crimes is the desire to prove himself the best thief in the world). This film is more evidence that Julianne Moore's career has been a rather chequered one. (She plays Electra here). Although she has starred in excellent films like "Far from Heaven" or "The Hours", she has also acted in her fair share of rubbish, examples being "Body of Evidence" and the dreadful Gus van Sant remake of Hitchcock's "Psycho", both of them even worse films than this one. "Assassins" is not a truly appalling film like either of those two examples; Richard Donner, who made "The Omen", the original "Superman" and the "Lethal Weapon" series is a competent director of action movies, and at a basic technical level is not a bad film. My overall, view, however, would be similar to my opinion of "The Specialist", namely that it is an uninspired, routine thriller marred by a misguided attempt to glorify a murderer by turning him into a hero. 4/10

    Robert Rath (Sylvester Stallone) is a professional killer for hire. Robert is tired of the business and he is willing to do one last hit before he retired. When Robert takes the job to kill his next target, he finds out that job is already taking care of by a ruthless killer by the name of Miguel Bien (Antonio Banderas). Robert finds out that he is double crossed by the mysterious person, who hires him for the job. Now Robert is forced to take five hits to financially allow him to retire. But Miguel again beats him to the punch expect not killing the last hit, he didn't found. An attractive computer hacker (Julianne Moore), who finds herself between Robert and Miguel. Now she is forced to help Robert to find his mysterious contractor before Miguel gets to them. Directed by Richard Donner (The Lethal Weapon Series, Superman 1 & 2, 16 Blocks) made an watchable, although flawed suspense-thriller with some good action sequences. Stallone is fine as the morose professional hit man. Moore does well in her supporting role. But it is Banderas, who has an great time as the crazed killer for hire. The movie does have an great first-half, although it slows down during the second half. Although an box office disappointment, "Assassins" does have an cult following and the movie is played often on TV. The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix Trilogy, Bound, Speed Racer) originally wrote the story and screenplay before it was heavily re-written by Oscar-Winner:Brian Helgeland (A Nightmare on Elm Street 4:The Dream Master, L.A. Confidential, Payback). Which the Wachowski Brothers tried to remove their names from the credits. "Assassins" is a extremely well made movie that could have been greater but falls short. It is certainly worth watching for the skilled action-set sequences and Banderas' amusingly over the top performance. (*** &frac12;/*****).

Professional hit-man Robert Rath (Stallone) is looking to get out of the game as age starts to catch up with him. After he misses out on a contract thanks to rival Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), Rath is offered a shot at $2 million. The target is an anonymous electronics whiz (Julianne Moore) who's trying to arrange a deal with some shady Dutch types in Seattle. But Bain is never far behind and as Rath begins to question his orders, both of their lives are in danger. Stallone, looking much younger on the film's poster than he does in the movie, is a strangely monotone hero (if you can call someone who kills or money a hero) and at no point do you feel, support or root for him. Banderas is much more engaging but this is because he's an evil equivalent of El Mariachi from "Desperado". Gun in each hand and hair in front of his face, you know the look. Anyway, the pair of them tear through the scenery with plenty of gusto and the action is satisfying enough even if it is a little old-school. The plot is pretty formulaic and predictable - in fact, the only real surprise is the lack of a sex scene. So far, so what? It couldn't be any more average if it wanted to be but "Assassins" does have a couple of interesting trivia points. The script, written and then disowned by the Wachowski brothers (creators of the first 21st century action movie "The Matrix"), isn't as bad as they reckon but it doesn't offer anything new or different. The director, Richard Donner, knows his stuff when it comes to the action genre but it doesn't feel like a quality product - all the guns sound silenced for some reason and there is an explosion which is badly imposed on the footage and gives the sense of a budget being ran dry. I also can't figure out why they paid Stallone such a vast sum of money for his performance because for $15 million, I'd at least expect a flicker of emotion or some facial movement. But the only things that move on Stallone's head are his eyes and lips and personally, I wonder if the Wachowski's disowned the script after they'd seen the movie.

    This movie is really about removing that which is old to replace it with something that is new. Robert (Sylvester Stallone) is an assassin working for the US government. Fifteen years previously he assassinated his mentor Nicholai as he was leaving a bank so that he could become number one. Now a younger assassin, Miguel (Antonio Banderas) has appeared and he wants Robert's position. This movie is an action movie and is quite good. Donner creates a very dreamlike feel to the movie, which possibly means that what we have is not always going to be there. Personally that is just a wild guess. The bigger theme in the movie is the fear that somebody younger will appear that is much better than you and thus making you obsolete. The world in the movie is one of assassins, but this is very much true in the business world where the older people have to keep on their toes with the younger executives who want their job. Then there are the conservative established companies who are being challenged by the new innovative companies. Assassins portrays life, a life where we must watch out for the ambitious coming up from below us and remain alert as they attempt to take from us the position that they want. Yet there is also a time when we want to retire, when we wish to give up, and the thing assassins says is that we can never retire because even if we give up the race, the race always seeks to come along and forcefully remove us. Assassins is done in a dreamlike state because it is a reflection of the world in which we live.

    Howard Hawks allegedly said of his film "Rio Bravo" that "we enjoyed making it so much that we made it again". He was, of course, referring to "El Dorado" which although it is not officially a remake of "Rio Bravo" shares with it a very similar plot and the same leading man, John Wayne. Hawks and Wayne were later to make the same film for a third time, this time under the title "Rio Lobo". It would appear that, with six "Rockies" and four "Rambos" under his belt, Sylvester Stallone also enjoys making the same film several times. His 1994 outing, "The Specialist", never generated a franchise in this way, possibly because it was given a deservedly hostile reception by the critics. He did, however, follow it up the following year with the very similar "Assassins" which can be regarded as an unacknowledged remake. In both films Stallone plays hit-men who earn their living by murdering people, the main difference that Ray Quick from "The Specialist" prefers to use explosives, whereas Robert Rath, Sly's character here, uses a gun as his weapon of choice. Now you might think that this would make them the villains of the piece, but both are in fact treated as the heroes of their respective films. Hollywood has often tended to romanticise professional assassins, the more recent Bradgelina love-fest "Mr. and Mrs Smith" being a good example, and Messrs Quick and Rath can both be regarded as Good Murderers to whom falls the task of protecting the innocent from Bad Murderers. (In between "The Specialist" and "Assassins", Sly had made "Judge Dredd", in which he plays another type of Good Murderer). In "Assassins" the Bad Murderer is Miguel Bain, a rival hit-man even more ruthless than Rath himself. When Rath discovers that both he and Bain have been assigned by their "contractor" to kill the same "mark", a computer hacker named Electra, he has a change of heart and decides to protect her from Bain. Similarly in "The Specialist" Stallone found himself trying to protect an attractive girl, played there by Sharon Stone, from the attentions of another Bad Murderer (James Woods). Despite Rath's change of heart, the difference between him and Bain, as far as their code of ethics is concerned, is really only paper-thin. Perhaps it was for this reason that Stallone and Antonio Banderas, who plays Bain, decided to make their characters as different as possible in terms of styles of acting. Banderas plays Bain as an aggressive, cocky and hyper-active loudmouth, the sort of man the audience would loathe even if he were not a vicious killer. Rath, by contrast, is quiet, reserved and stony-faced. Rath's main motivation is financial, whereas Bain is obsessed with the psychological need to prove himself a better assassin than the older, more experienced Rath. (The idea of crime as a competitive sport is a common one in the cinema, another example being "Ocean's Twelve" which features a criminal whose motive for committing crimes is the desire to prove himself the best thief in the world). This film is more evidence that Julianne Moore's career has been a rather chequered one. (She plays Electra here). Although she has starred in excellent films like "Far from Heaven" or "The Hours", she has also acted in her fair share of rubbish, examples being "Body of Evidence" and the dreadful Gus van Sant remake of Hitchcock's "Psycho", both of them even worse films than this one. "Assassins" is not a truly appalling film like either of those two examples; Richard Donner, who made "The Omen", the original "Superman" and the "Lethal Weapon" series is a competent director of action movies, and at a basic technical level is not a bad film. My overall, view, however, would be similar to my opinion of "The Specialist", namely that it is an uninspired, routine thriller marred by a misguided attempt to glorify a murderer by turning him into a hero. 4/10

    Robert Rath (Sylvester Stallone) is a professional killer for hire. Robert is tired of the business and he is willing to do one last hit before he retired. When Robert takes the job to kill his next target, he finds out that job is already taking care of by a ruthless killer by the name of Miguel Bien (Antonio Banderas). Robert finds out that he is double crossed by the mysterious person, who hires him for the job. Now Robert is forced to take five hits to financially allow him to retire. But Miguel again beats him to the punch expect not killing the last hit, he didn't found. An attractive computer hacker (Julianne Moore), who finds herself between Robert and Miguel. Now she is forced to help Robert to find his mysterious contractor before Miguel gets to them. Directed by Richard Donner (The Lethal Weapon Series, Superman 1 & 2, 16 Blocks) made an watchable, although flawed suspense-thriller with some good action sequences. Stallone is fine as the morose professional hit man. Moore does well in her supporting role. But it is Banderas, who has an great time as the crazed killer for hire. The movie does have an great first-half, although it slows down during the second half. Although an box office disappointment, "Assassins" does have an cult following and the movie is played often on TV. The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix Trilogy, Bound, Speed Racer) originally wrote the story and screenplay before it was heavily re-written by Oscar-Winner:Brian Helgeland (A Nightmare on Elm Street 4:The Dream Master, L.A. Confidential, Payback). Which the Wachowski Brothers tried to remove their names from the credits. "Assassins" is a extremely well made movie that could have been greater but falls short. It is certainly worth watching for the skilled action-set sequences and Banderas' amusingly over the top performance. (*** &frac12;/*****).

    Antonio Banderas is outstanding in this movie and no one has put this in his resume. He was great!! He stole the show from Stallone. Great actor love his craziness!! Antonio kicked butt!! One of the best action movies and never mentioned as a top rated movie. Beats a lot of movies these days. Today is nothing like yesterday!! I would love to see Stallone and Banderas in another movie together there was great chemistry. I hope there are other viewers who agree with me on this. I'm hoping to stop writing now but the guidelines saying i need more text! i hope they will now take this or i will scream!Okay i'm screaming now i have nothing else to write-hello. OMG finally!!!

    This movie is great if your looking for an action thriller featuring famous faces and great performances.Let's start with the famous Rocky star. Sylvester Stallone gives a good performance as a contract assassin who wants out. He performs the role well, and works well with his co- stars Julianne Moore and Antonio Banderas. Julianne Moore gives a good performance as the love interest to Stallone's character. She performs the role with emotion and does a respectable job of it. Now, when I watched this film recently all I thought of was how amazing Antonio Banderas performed his role as the arch-nemesis of Stallone's character. Banderas did an excellent job on his character, he performed it with depth, emotion and wit. His performance was convincing and made the movie that much better for me. He was the star of the movie even though he wasn't meant to be the star of the movie. He out acts Stallone and Moore, he makes the movie what it is with his memorable performance as Bain, it reminds me very much of how Heath Ledger was a key to the success of the Dark Knight. Banderas was key the the movies success, but overall it was a good movie with great characters. And great performances from a star cast.

    The Macguffin is a computer disk possessed by Moore who is a computer jock who does shakedowns of shady people, but this time she has downloaded and attempted to blackmail a quarry she should have left alone. Stallone, a professional assassin who gets his instructions from an anonymous computer source, is called in to get a mark, some right-wing South American figure, but he's ready to retire. Just when Stallone's about to assassinate him at a funeral, a competing assassin, Banderas, appears, and takes the contract. Stallone knows that he is being targeted, so on his next assignment, which is Moore and the disk, he reneges when Banderas again appears. Well-staged chases and close escapes ensue, in several locations. We also are treated to love developing between Stallone and Moore, who are initially antagonists. Donner's sure directing hand gives us a smooth result. Stallone and Moore stand out. Banderas' character is a clich&eacute;, namely, a competitive, hot-tempered, macho Latin man who wants to be number one. Each sequence in the movie is well-developed, especially the climactic scenes on a Caribbean island that involve a deteriorating hotel. The script develops character mainly through action and plot development, so that it engages viewers. A good show overall that made me realize that assassins are vulnerable to being assassinated because they know where the bodies are. The only way to prevent the threat of himself being killed is not to know who or where the orders come from. Stallone has that arrangement, and even that turns out to be dangerous.

    Director Richard Donner helms this action-adventure yarn in which Robert Rath,portrayed by Sylvester Stallone, a veteran, burned-out hit man for hire who's looking to leave his profession, meets a younger, crazier, more ambitious competitor, Miguel Bain,played by Antonio Banderas, who is out to best Rath and make him a target in the process in this movie,Assassins. Julianne Moore co-stars in this film written by Andy and Larry Wachowski together with Brian Helgeland. Rath signs on for one last hit, but complications ensue when he falls in love with the mark, a beautiful, mysterious woman named Electra. Bain sets out to murder Electra as well.The two are competing to hit the same target for a $20-million payoff, and their challenge takes them from explosion to explosion on a cat-and-mouse chase from Seattle to Mexico and the chase leads the two assassins into a deadly game of wits. Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas seem as if they didn't know quite what to do to make this implausible action drama a kick.As for the screenplay,the plot becomes increasingly silly, and while some pleasure can be had in the improbable set pieces, this is not nearly as much fun as it should be.But nevertheless,Richard Donner managed to give this movie a style as he handles action sequences with adequate flair and has a good time blowing things up.Overall,it manages to become a guilty pleasure especially for viewers who love action thrillers.

    Richard Donner's 'Assassins' is Time-Pass! A Fast-Paced, Edgy Action Flick, that works, along-with with winning performances. 'Assassins' Synopsis: Robert Rath is a seasoned hit-man who just wants out of the business with no back talk. But, as things go, it ain't so easy. A younger, peppier assassin named Bain is having a field day trying to kill said older assassin. Rath teams up with a computer hacker named Electra to defeat the obsessed Bain. 'Assassins' is Fast-Paced & Edgy, and it gets it right on more than just one occasion. Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski & Brian Helgeland's Screenplay is entertaining & well-paced. Richard Donner's Direction is as good as ever. Cinematography is fair. Editing is passable. Performance-Wise: Stallone is super, as always. Antonio Banderas is a terrific actor & he proves that fact right once again with 'Assassins'. He plays the heartless villain to perfection. Julianne Moore looks a million bucks & performs with her usual style. Anatoly Davydov is alright. On the whole, 'Assassins' is worth a look.

    Assassins is a top notch, big budget thriller that is often over looked when discussing Stallone's filmography. Which is a shame, cause it's one of Sly's better films and his performance as an aging burn out hit-man is quite solid. Antonio Banderas really steals the show though as the over the top and cocky newcomer who idolizes Stallone's character. Banderas is full of energy and his performance is electric. Miguel Bain is one of Banderas' best roles. An all time great movie villain perhaps. Many fans forget about Stallone's solid output in the 90's, Cliffhanger is always mentioned but Assassins seems to be forgotten. It's a slick and explosive action thriller from "Lethal Weapon" director Donner. Featuring some great dialog and shoot outs between Stallone and Banderas. On the negative side, the film is too long. Running over 2 hours, "Assassins" begins to wear out it's welcome. And the love story between Moore and Stallone is too cheesy and unrealistic to be taken seriously. Like "Daylight" and "Copland", "Assassins" is one of Stallone's most underrated films from the 90's. An over looked gem that deserves to be seen again.

    A mid-Nineties action film starring Sylvester Stallone and directed by the helmer of the "Lethal Weapon" series hardly sounds like a recipe for greatness, does it? It's not the sort of the film that troubles award committees or quickens the heart-rate of critics. But audiences lap these sort of films up and especially guys who enjoy explosions and gun fights and various macho activities. Which I do but this effort never really steps it up and seems perfectly happy to remain in third gear without getting anywhere near top speed. Professional hit-man Robert Rath (Stallone) is looking to get out of the game as age starts to catch up with him.

    This movie is great if your looking for an action thriller featuring famous faces and great performances.Let's start with the famous Rocky star.

Julianne Moore gives a good performance as the love interest to Stallone's character. She performs the role with emotion and does a respectable job of it.

He out acts Stallone and Moore, he makes the movie what it is with his memorable performance as Bain, it reminds me very much of how Heath Ledger was a key to the success of the Dark Knight. Banderas was key the the movies success, but overall it was a good movie with great characters. And great performances from a star cast.

    The Macguffin is a computer disk possessed by Moore who is a computer jock who does shakedowns of shady people, but this time she has downloaded and attempted to blackmail a quarry she should have left alone. Stallone, a professional assassin who gets his instructions from an anonymous computer source, is called in to get a mark, some right-wing South American figure, but he's ready to retire. Just when Stallone's about to assassinate him at a funeral, a competing assassin, Banderas, appears, and takes the contract. Stallone knows that he is being targeted, so on his next assignment, which is Moore and the disk, he reneges when Banderas again appears. Well-staged chases and close escapes ensue, in several locations. We also are treated to love developing between Stallone and Moore, who are initially antagonists. Donner's sure directing hand gives us a smooth result. Stallone and Moore stand out. Banderas' character is a clich&eacute;, namely, a competitive, hot-tempered, macho Latin man who wants to be number one. Each sequence in the movie is well-developed, especially the climactic scenes on a Caribbean island that involve a deteriorating hotel. The script develops character mainly through action and plot development, so that it engages viewers. A good show overall that made me realize that assassins are vulnerable to being assassinated because they know where the bodies are. The only way to prevent the threat of himself being killed is not to know who or where the orders come from. Stallone has that arrangement, and even that turns out to be dangerous.

    Director Richard Donner helms this action-adventure yarn in which Robert Rath,portrayed by Sylvester Stallone, a veteran, burned-out hit man for hire who's looking to leave his profession, meets a younger, crazier, more ambitious competitor, Miguel Bain,played by Antonio Banderas, who is out to best Rath and make him a target in the process in this movie,Assassins. Julianne Moore co-stars in this film written by Andy and Larry Wachowski together with Brian Helgeland. Rath signs on for one last hit, but complications ensue when he falls in love with the mark, a beautiful, mysterious woman named Electra. Bain sets out to murder Electra as well.The two are competing to hit the same target for a $20-million payoff, and their challenge takes them from explosion to explosion on a cat-and-mouse chase from Seattle to Mexico and the chase leads the two assassins into a deadly game of wits. Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas seem as if they didn't know quite what to do to make this implausible action drama a kick.As for the screenplay,the plot becomes increasingly silly, and while some pleasure can be had in the improbable set pieces, this is not nearly as much fun as it should be.But nevertheless,Richard Donner managed to give this movie a style as he handles action sequences with adequate flair and has a good time blowing things up.Overall,it manages to become a guilty pleasure especially for viewers who love action thrillers.

    Richard Donner's 'Assassins' is Time-Pass! A Fast-Paced, Edgy Action Flick, that works, along-with with winning performances. 'Assassins' Synopsis: Robert Rath is a seasoned hit-man who just wants out of the business with no back talk. But, as things go, it ain't so easy. A younger, peppier assassin named Bain is having a field day trying to kill said older assassin. Rath teams up with a computer hacker named Electra to defeat the obsessed Bain. 'Assassins' is Fast-Paced & Edgy, and it gets it right on more than just one occasion. Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski & Brian Helgeland's Screenplay is entertaining & well-paced. Richard Donner's Direction is as good as ever. Cinematography is fair. Editing is passable. Performance-Wise: Stallone is super, as always. Antonio Banderas is a terrific actor & he proves that fact right once again with 'Assassins'. He plays the heartless villain to perfection. Julianne Moore looks a million bucks & performs with her usual style. Anatoly Davydov is alright. On the whole, 'Assassins' is worth a look.

    Assassins is a top notch, big budget thriller that is often over looked when discussing Stallone's filmography. Which is a shame, cause it's one of Sly's better films and his performance as an aging burn out hit-man is quite solid. Antonio Banderas really steals the show though as the over the top and cocky newcomer who idolizes Stallone's character. Banderas is full of energy and his performance is electric. Miguel Bain is one of Banderas' best roles. An all time great movie villain perhaps. Many fans forget about Stallone's solid output in the 90's, Cliffhanger is always mentioned but Assassins seems to be forgotten. It's a slick and explosive action thriller from "Lethal Weapon" director Donner. Featuring some great dialog and shoot outs between Stallone and Banderas. On the negative side, the film is too long. Running over 2 hours, "Assassins" begins to wear out it's welcome. And the love story between Moore and Stallone is too cheesy and unrealistic to be taken seriously. Like "Daylight" and "Copland", "Assassins" is one of Stallone's most underrated films from the 90's. An over looked gem that deserves to be seen again.

    A mid-Nineties action film starring Sylvester Stallone and directed by the helmer of the "Lethal Weapon" series hardly sounds like a recipe for greatness, does it? It's not the sort of the film that troubles award committees or quickens the heart-rate of critics. But audiences lap these sort of films up and especially guys who enjoy explosions and gun fights and various macho activities. Which I do but this effort never really steps it up and seems perfectly happy to remain in third gear without getting anywhere near top speed. Professional hit-man Robert Rath (Stallone) is looking to get out of the game as age starts to catch up with him. After he misses out on a contract thanks to rival Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), Rath is offered a shot at $2 million. The target is an anonymous electronics whiz (Julianne Moore) who's trying to arrange a deal with some shady Dutch types in Seattle. But Bain is never far behind and as Rath begins to question his orders, both of their lives are in danger. Stallone, looking much younger on the film's poster than he does in the movie, is a strangely monotone hero (if you can call someone who kills or money a hero) and at no point do you feel, support or root for him. Banderas is much more engaging but this is because he's an evil equivalent of El Mariachi from "Desperado". Gun in each hand and hair in front of his face, you know the look. Anyway, the pair of them tear through the scenery with plenty of gusto and the action is satisfying enough even if it is a little old-school. The plot is pretty formulaic and predictable - in fact, the only real surprise is the lack of a sex scene. So far, so what? It couldn't be any more average if it wanted to be but "Assassins" does have a couple of interesting trivia points. The script, written and then disowned by the Wachowski brothers (creators of the first 21st century action movie "The Matrix"), isn't as bad as they reckon but it doesn't offer anything new or different. The director, Richard Donner, knows his stuff when it comes to the action genre but it doesn't feel like a quality product - all the guns sound silenced for some reason and there is an explosion which is badly imposed on the footage and gives the sense of a budget being ran dry. I also can't figure out why they paid Stallone such a vast sum of money for his performance because for $15 million, I'd at least expect a flicker of emotion or some facial movement. But the only things that move on Stallone's head are his eyes and lips and personally, I wonder if the Wachowski's disowned the script after they'd seen the movie.

    This movie is really about removing that which is old to replace it with something that is new. Robert (Sylvester Stallone) is an assassin working for the US government. Fifteen years previously he assassinated his mentor Nicholai as he was leaving a bank so that he could become number one. Now a younger assassin, Miguel (Antonio Banderas) has appeared and he wants Robert's position. This movie is an action movie and is quite good. Donner creates a very dreamlike feel to the movie, which possibly means that what we have is not always going to be there. Personally that is just a wild guess. The bigger theme in the movie is the fear that somebody younger will appear that is much better than you and thus making you obsolete. The world in the movie is one of assassins, but this is very much true in the business world where the older people have to keep on their toes with the younger executives who want their job. Then there are the conservative established companies who are being challenged by the new innovative companies. Assassins portrays life, a life where we must watch out for the ambitious coming up from below us and remain alert as they attempt to take from us the position that they want. Yet there is also a time when we want to retire, when we wish to give up, and the thing assassins says is that we can never retire because even if we give up the race, the race always seeks to come along and forcefully remove us. Assassins is done in a dreamlike state because it is a reflection of the world in which we live.

    Howard Hawks allegedly said of his film "Rio Bravo" that "we enjoyed making it so much that we made it again". He was, of course, referring to "El Dorado" which although it is not officially a remake of "Rio Bravo" shares with it a very similar plot and the same leading man, John Wayne. Hawks and Wayne were later to make the same film for a third time, this time under the title "Rio Lobo". It would appear that, with six "Rockies" and four "Rambos" under his belt, Sylvester Stallone also enjoys making the same film several times. His 1994 outing, "The Specialist", never generated a franchise in this way, possibly because it was given a deservedly hostile reception by the critics. He did, however, follow it up the following year with the very similar "Assassins" which can be regarded as an unacknowledged remake. In both films Stallone plays hit-men who earn their living by murdering people, the main difference that Ray Quick from "The Specialist" prefers to use explosives, whereas Robert Rath, Sly's character here, uses a gun as his weapon of choice. Now you might think that this would make them the villains of the piece, but both are in fact treated as the heroes of their respective films. Hollywood has often tended to romanticise professional assassins, the more recent Bradgelina love-fest "Mr. and Mrs Smith" being a good example, and Messrs Quick and Rath can both be regarded as Good Murderers to whom falls the task of protecting the innocent from Bad Murderers. (In between "The Specialist" and "Assassins", Sly had made "Judge Dredd", in which he plays another type of Good Murderer). In "Assassins" the Bad Murderer is Miguel Bain, a rival hit-man even more ruthless than Rath himself. When Rath discovers that both he and Bain have been assigned by their "contractor" to kill the same "mark", a computer hacker named Electra, he has a change of heart and decides to protect her from Bain. Similarly in "The Specialist" Stallone found himself trying to protect an attractive girl, played there by Sharon Stone, from the attentions of another Bad Murderer (James Woods). Despite Rath's change of heart, the difference between him and Bain, as far as their code of ethics is concerned, is really only paper-thin. Perhaps it was for this reason that Stallone and Antonio Banderas, who plays Bain, decided to make their characters as different as possible in terms of styles of acting. Banderas plays Bain as an aggressive, cocky and hyper-active loudmouth, the sort of man the audience would loathe even if he were not a vicious killer. Rath, by contrast, is quiet, reserved and stony-faced. Rath's main motivation is financial, whereas Bain is obsessed with the psychological need to prove himself a better assassin than the older, more experienced Rath. (The idea of crime as a competitive sport is a common one in the cinema, another example being "Ocean's Twelve" which features a criminal whose motive for committing crimes is the desire to prove himself the best thief in the world). This film is more evidence that Julianne Moore's career has been a rather chequered one. (She plays Electra here). Although she has starred in excellent films like "Far from Heaven" or "The Hours", she has also acted in her fair share of rubbish, examples being "Body of Evidence" and the dreadful Gus van Sant remake of Hitchcock's "Psycho", both of them even worse films than this one. "Assassins" is not a truly appalling film like either of those two examples; Richard Donner, who made "The Omen", the original "Superman" and the "Lethal Weapon" series is a competent director of action movies, and at a basic technical level is not a bad film. My overall, view, however, would be similar to my opinion of "The Specialist", namely that it is an uninspired, routine thriller marred by a misguided attempt to glorify a murderer by turning him into a hero. 4/10

    Robert Rath (Sylvester Stallone) is a professional killer for hire. Robert is tired of the business and he is willing to do one last hit before he retired. When Robert takes the job to kill his next target, he finds out that job is already taking care of by a ruthless killer by the name of Miguel Bien (Antonio Banderas). Robert finds out that he is double crossed by the mysterious person, who hires him for the job. Now Robert is forced to take five hits to financially allow him to retire. But Miguel again beats him to the punch expect not killing the last hit, he didn't found. An attractive computer hacker (Julianne Moore), who finds herself between Robert and Miguel. Now she is forced to help Robert to find his mysterious contractor before Miguel gets to them. Directed by Richard Donner (The Lethal Weapon Series, Superman 1 & 2, 16 Blocks) made an watchable, although flawed suspense-thriller with some good action sequences. Stallone is fine as the morose professional hit man. Moore does well in her supporting role. But it is Banderas, who has an great time as the crazed killer for hire. The movie does have an great first-half, although it slows down during the second half. Although an box office disappointment, "Assassins" does have an cult following and the movie is played often on TV. The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix Trilogy, Bound, Speed Racer) originally wrote the story and screenplay before it was heavily re-written by Oscar-Winner:Brian Helgeland (A Nightmare on Elm Street 4:The Dream Master, L.A. Confidential, Payback). Which the Wachowski Brothers tried to remove their names from the credits. "Assassins" is a extremely well made movie that could have been greater but falls short. It is certainly worth watching for the skilled action-set sequences and Banderas' amusingly over the top performance. (*** &frac12;/*****).

    Antonio Banderas is outstanding in this movie and no one has put this in his resume. He was great!! He stole the show from Stallone. Great actor love his craziness!! Antonio kicked butt!! One of the best action movies and never mentioned as a top rated movie. Beats a lot of movies these days. Today is nothing like yesterday!! I would love to see Stallone and Banderas in another movie together there was great chemistry. I hope there are other viewers who agree with me on this. I'm hoping to stop writing now but the guidelines saying i need more text! i hope they will now take this or i will scream!Okay i'm screaming now i have nothing else to write-hello. OMG finally!!!

    This movie is great if your looking for an action thriller featuring famous faces and great performances.Let's start with the famous Rocky star. Sylvester Stallone gives a good performance as a contract assassin who wants out. He performs the role well, and works well with his co- stars Julianne Moore and Antonio Banderas. Julianne Moore gives a good performance as the love interest to Stallone's character. She performs the role with emotion and does a respectable job of it. Now, when I watched this film recently all I thought of was how amazing Antonio Banderas performed his role as the arch-nemesis of Stallone's character. Banderas did an excellent job on his character, he performed it with depth, emotion and wit. His performance was convincing and made the movie that much better for me. He was the star of the movie even though he wasn't meant to be the star of the movie. He out acts Stallone and Moore, he makes the movie what it is with his memorable performance as Bain, it reminds me very much of how Heath Ledger was a key to the success of the Dark Knight. Banderas was key the the movies success, but overall it was a good movie with great characters. And great performances from a star cast.

He was, of course, referring to "El Dorado" which although it is not officially a remake of "Rio Bravo" shares with it a very similar plot and the same leading man, John Wayne. Hawks and Wayne were later to make the same film for a third time, this time under the title "Rio Lobo". It would appear that, with six "Rockies" and four "Rambos" under his belt, Sylvester Stallone also enjoys making the same film several times. His 1994 outing, "The Specialist", never generated a franchise in this way, possibly because it was given a deservedly hostile reception by the critics. He did, however, follow it up the following year with the very similar "Assassins" which can be regarded as an unacknowledged remake. In both films Stallone plays hit-men who earn their living by murdering people, the main difference that Ray Quick from "The Specialist" prefers to use explosives, whereas Robert Rath, Sly's character here, uses a gun as his weapon of choice. Now you might think that this would make them the villains of the piece, but both are in fact treated as the heroes of their respective films. Hollywood has often tended to romanticise professional assassins, the more recent Bradgelina love-fest "Mr. and Mrs Smith" being a good example, and Messrs Quick and Rath can both be regarded as Good Murderers to whom falls the task of protecting the innocent from Bad Murderers. (In between "The Specialist" and "Assassins", Sly had made "Judge Dredd", in which he plays another type of Good Murderer). In "Assassins" the Bad Murderer is Miguel Bain, a rival hit-man even more ruthless than Rath himself. When Rath discovers that both he and Bain have been assigned by their "contractor" to kill the same "mark", a computer hacker named Electra, he has a change of heart and decides to protect her from Bain. Similarly in "The Specialist" Stallone found himself trying to protect an attractive girl, played there by Sharon Stone, from the attentions of another Bad Murderer (James Woods). Despite Rath's change of heart, the difference between him and Bain, as far as their code of ethics is concerned, is really only paper-thin. Perhaps it was for this reason that Stallone and Antonio Banderas, who plays Bain, decided to make their characters as different as possible in terms of styles of acting. Banderas plays Bain as an aggressive, cocky and hyper-active loudmouth, the sort of man the audience would loathe even if he were not a vicious killer. Rath, by contrast, is quiet, reserved and stony-faced. Rath's main motivation is financial, whereas Bain is obsessed with the psychological need to prove himself a better assassin than the older, more experienced Rath. (The idea of crime as a competitive sport is a common one in the cinema, another example being "Ocean's Twelve" which features a criminal whose motive for committing crimes is the desire to prove himself the best thief in the world). This film is more evidence that Julianne Moore's career has been a rather chequered one. (She plays Electra here). Although she has starred in excellent films like "Far from Heaven" or "The Hours", she has also acted in her fair share of rubbish, examples being "Body of Evidence" and the dreadful Gus van Sant remake of Hitchcock's "Psycho", both of them even worse films than this one. "Assassins" is not a truly appalling film like either of those two examples; Richard Donner, who made "The Omen", the original "Superman" and the "Lethal Weapon" series is a competent director of action movies, and at a basic technical level is not a bad film. My overall, view, however, would be similar to my opinion of "The Specialist", namely that it is an uninspired, routine thriller marred by a misguided attempt to glorify a murderer by turning him into a hero. 4/10

    Robert Rath (Sylvester Stallone) is a professional killer for hire. Robert is tired of the business and he is willing to do one last hit before he retired. When Robert takes the job to kill his next target, he finds out that job is already taking care of by a ruthless killer by the name of Miguel Bien (Antonio Banderas). Robert finds out that he is double crossed by the mysterious person, who hires him for the job. Now Robert is forced to take five hits to financially allow him to retire. But Miguel again beats him to the punch expect not killing the last hit, he didn't found. An attractive computer hacker (Julianne Moore), who finds herself between Robert and Miguel. Now she is forced to help Robert to find his mysterious contractor before Miguel gets to them. Directed by Richard Donner (The Lethal Weapon Series, Superman 1 & 2, 16 Blocks) made an watchable, although flawed suspense-thriller with some good action sequences. Stallone is fine as the morose professional hit man. Moore does well in her supporting role. But it is Banderas, who has an great time as the crazed killer for hire. The movie does have an great first-half, although it slows down during the second half. Although an box office disappointment, "Assassins" does have an cult following and the movie is played often on TV. The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix Trilogy, Bound, Speed Racer) originally wrote the story and screenplay before it was heavily re-written by Oscar-Winner:Brian Helgeland (A Nightmare on Elm Street 4:The Dream Master, L.A. Confidential, Payback). Which the Wachowski Brothers tried to remove their names from the credits. "Assassins" is a extremely well made movie that could have been greater but falls short. It is certainly worth watching for the skilled action-set sequences and Banderas' amusingly over the top performance. (*** &frac12;/*****).

    Antonio Banderas is outstanding in this movie and no one has put this in his resume. He was great!! He stole the show from Stallone. Great actor love his craziness!! Antonio kicked butt!! One of the best action movies and never mentioned as a top rated movie. Beats a lot of movies these days. Today is nothing like yesterday!! I would love to see Stallone and Banderas in another movie together there was great chemistry. I hope there are other viewers who agree with me on this. I'm hoping to stop writing now but the guidelines saying i need more text! i hope they will now take this or i will scream!Okay i'm screaming now i have nothing else to write-hello. OMG finally!!!

    This movie is great if your looking for an action thriller featuring famous faces and great performances.Let's start with the famous Rocky star. Sylvester Stallone gives a good performance as a contract assassin who wants out. He performs the role well, and works well with his co- stars Julianne Moore and Antonio Banderas. Julianne Moore gives a good performance as the love interest to Stallone's character. She performs the role with emotion and does a respectable job of it. Now, when I watched this film recently all I thought of was how amazing Antonio Banderas performed his role as the arch-nemesis of Stallone's character. Banderas did an excellent job on his character, he performed it with depth, emotion and wit. His performance was convincing and made the movie that much better for me. He was the star of the movie even though he wasn't meant to be the star of the movie. He out acts Stallone and Moore, he makes the movie what it is with his memorable performance as Bain, it reminds me very much of how Heath Ledger was a key to the success of the Dark Knight. Banderas was key the the movies success, but overall it was a good movie with great characters. And great performances from a star cast.

    The Macguffin is a computer disk possessed by Moore who is a computer jock who does shakedowns of shady people, but this time she has downloaded and attempted to blackmail a quarry she should have left alone. Stallone, a professional assassin who gets his instructions from an anonymous computer source, is called in to get a mark, some right-wing South American figure, but he's ready to retire. Just when Stallone's about to assassinate him at a funeral, a competing assassin, Banderas, appears, and takes the contract. Stallone knows that he is being targeted, so on his next assignment, which is Moore and the disk, he reneges when Banderas again appears. Well-staged chases and close escapes ensue, in several locations. We also are treated to love developing between Stallone and Moore, who are initially antagonists. Donner's sure directing hand gives us a smooth result. Stallone and Moore stand out. Banderas' character is a clich&eacute;, namely, a competitive, hot-tempered, macho Latin man who wants to be number one. Each sequence in the movie is well-developed, especially the climactic scenes on a Caribbean island that involve a deteriorating hotel. The script develops character mainly through action and plot development, so that it engages viewers. A good show overall that made me realize that assassins are vulnerable to being assassinated because they know where the bodies are. The only way to prevent the threat of himself being killed is not to know who or where the orders come from. Stallone has that arrangement, and even that turns out to be dangerous.

    Director Richard Donner helms this action-adventure yarn in which Robert Rath,portrayed by Sylvester Stallone, a veteran, burned-out hit man for hire who's looking to leave his profession, meets a younger, crazier, more ambitious competitor, Miguel Bain,played by Antonio Banderas, who is out to best Rath and make him a target in the process in this movie,Assassins. Julianne Moore co-stars in this film written by Andy and Larry Wachowski together with Brian Helgeland. Rath signs on for one last hit, but complications ensue when he falls in love with the mark, a beautiful, mysterious woman named Electra. Bain sets out to murder Electra as well.The two are competing to hit the same target for a $20-million payoff, and their challenge takes them from explosion to explosion on a cat-and-mouse chase from Seattle to Mexico and the chase leads the two assassins into a deadly game of wits. Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas seem as if they didn't know quite what to do to make this implausible action drama a kick.As for the screenplay,the plot becomes increasingly silly, and while some pleasure can be had in the improbable set pieces, this is not nearly as much fun as it should be.But nevertheless,Richard Donner managed to give this movie a style as he handles action sequences with adequate flair and has a good time blowing things up.Overall,it manages to become a guilty pleasure especially for viewers who love action thrillers.

    Richard Donner's 'Assassins' is Time-Pass! A Fast-Paced, Edgy Action Flick, that works, along-with with winning performances. 'Assassins' Synopsis: Robert Rath is a seasoned hit-man who just wants out of the business with no back talk. But, as things go, it ain't so easy. A younger, peppier assassin named Bain is having a field day trying to kill said older assassin. Rath teams up with a computer hacker named Electra to defeat the obsessed Bain. 'Assassins' is Fast-Paced & Edgy, and it gets it right on more than just one occasion. Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski & Brian Helgeland's Screenplay is entertaining & well-paced. Richard Donner's Direction is as good as ever. Cinematography is fair. Editing is passable. Performance-Wise: Stallone is super, as always. Antonio Banderas is a terrific actor & he proves that fact right once again with 'Assassins'. He plays the heartless villain to perfection. Julianne Moore looks a million bucks & performs with her usual style. Anatoly Davydov is alright. On the whole, 'Assassins' is worth a look.

    Assassins is a top notch, big budget thriller that is often over looked when discussing Stallone's filmography. Which is a shame, cause it's one of Sly's better films and his performance as an aging burn out hit-man is quite solid. Antonio Banderas really steals the show though as the over the top and cocky newcomer who idolizes Stallone's character. Banderas is full of energy and his performance is electric. Miguel Bain is one of Banderas' best roles. An all time great movie villain perhaps. Many fans forget about Stallone's solid output in the 90's, Cliffhanger is always mentioned but Assassins seems to be forgotten. It's a slick and explosive action thriller from "Lethal Weapon" director Donner. Featuring some great dialog and shoot outs between Stallone and Banderas. On the negative side, the film is too long. Running over 2 hours, "Assassins" begins to wear out it's welcome. And the love story between Moore and Stallone is too cheesy and unrealistic to be taken seriously. Like "Daylight" and "Copland", "Assassins" is one of Stallone's most underrated films from the 90's. An over looked gem that deserves to be seen again.

    A mid-Nineties action film starring Sylvester Stallone and directed by the helmer of the "Lethal Weapon" series hardly sounds like a recipe for greatness, does it? It's not the sort of the film that troubles award committees or quickens the heart-rate of critics. But audiences lap these sort of films up and especially guys who enjoy explosions and gun fights and various macho activities. Which I do but this effort never really steps it up and seems perfectly happy to remain in third gear without getting anywhere near top speed. Professional hit-man Robert Rath (Stallone) is looking to get out of the game as age starts to catch up with him. After he misses out on a contract thanks to rival Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), Rath is offered a shot at $2 million. The target is an anonymous electronics whiz (Julianne Moore) who's trying to arrange a deal with some shady Dutch types in Seattle. But Bain is never far behind and as Rath begins to question his orders, both of their lives are in danger. Stallone, looking much younger on the film's poster than he does in the movie, is a strangely monotone hero (if you can call someone who kills or money a hero) and at no point do you feel, support or root for him. Banderas is much more engaging but this is because he's an evil equivalent of El Mariachi from "Desperado". Gun in each hand and hair in front of his face, you know the look. Anyway, the pair of them tear through the scenery with plenty of gusto and the action is satisfying enough even if it is a little old-school. The plot is pretty formulaic and predictable - in fact, the only real surprise is the lack of a sex scene. So far, so what? It couldn't be any more average if it wanted to be but "Assassins" does have a couple of interesting trivia points. The script, written and then disowned by the Wachowski brothers (creators of the first 21st century action movie "The Matrix"), isn't as bad as they reckon but it doesn't offer anything new or different. The director, Richard Donner, knows his stuff when it comes to the action genre but it doesn't feel like a quality product - all the guns sound silenced for some reason and there is an explosion which is badly imposed on the footage and gives the sense of a budget being ran dry. I also can't figure out why they paid Stallone such a vast sum of money for his performance because for $15 million, I'd at least expect a flicker of emotion or some facial movement. But the only things that move on Stallone's head are his eyes and lips and personally, I wonder if the Wachowski's disowned the script after they'd seen the movie.

    This movie is really about removing that which is old to replace it with something that is new. Robert (Sylvester Stallone) is an assassin working for the US government. Fifteen years previously he assassinated his mentor Nicholai as he was leaving a bank so that he could become number one. Now a younger assassin, Miguel (Antonio Banderas) has appeared and he wants Robert's position. This movie is an action movie and is quite good. Donner creates a very dreamlike feel to the movie, which possibly means that what we have is not always going to be there. Personally that is just a wild guess. The bigger theme in the movie is the fear that somebody younger will appear that is much better than you and thus making you obsolete. The world in the movie is one of assassins, but this is very much true in the business world where the older people have to keep on their toes with the younger executives who want their job. Then there are the conservative established companies who are being challenged by the new innovative companies. Assassins portrays life, a life where we must watch out for the ambitious coming up from below us and remain alert as they attempt to take from us the position that they want. Yet there is also a time when we want to retire, when we wish to give up, and the thing assassins says is that we can never retire because even if we give up the race, the race always seeks to come along and forcefully remove us. Assassins is done in a dreamlike state because it is a reflection of the world in which we live.

He was, of course, referring to "El Dorado" which although it is not officially a remake of "Rio Bravo" shares with it a very similar plot and the same leading man, John Wayne. Hawks and Wayne were later to make the same film for a third time, this time under the title "Rio Lobo".

'Assassins' Synopsis: Robert Rath is a seasoned hit-man who just wants out of the business with no back talk. But, as things go, it ain't so easy. A younger, peppier assassin named Bain is having a field day trying to kill said older assassin. Rath teams up with a computer hacker named Electra to defeat the obsessed Bain. 'Assassins' is Fast-Paced & Edgy, and it gets it right on more than just one occasion. Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski & Brian Helgeland's Screenplay is entertaining & well-paced. Richard Donner's Direction is as good as ever. Cinematography is fair. Editing is passable. Performance-Wise: Stallone is super, as always. Antonio Banderas is a terrific actor & he proves that fact right once again with 'Assassins'. He plays the heartless villain to perfection. Julianne Moore looks a million bucks & performs with her usual style. Anatoly Davydov is alright. On the whole, 'Assassins' is worth a look.

    Assassins is a top notch, big budget thriller that is often over looked when discussing Stallone's filmography. Which is a shame, cause it's one of Sly's better films and his performance as an aging burn out hit-man is quite solid. Antonio Banderas really steals the show though as the over the top and cocky newcomer who idolizes Stallone's character. Banderas is full of energy and his performance is electric. Miguel Bain is one of Banderas' best roles. An all time great movie villain perhaps. Many fans forget about Stallone's solid output in the 90's, Cliffhanger is always mentioned but Assassins seems to be forgotten. It's a slick and explosive action thriller from "Lethal Weapon" director Donner. Featuring some great dialog and shoot outs between Stallone and Banderas. On the negative side, the film is too long. Running over 2 hours, "Assassins" begins to wear out it's welcome. And the love story between Moore and Stallone is too cheesy and unrealistic to be taken seriously. Like "Daylight" and "Copland", "Assassins" is one of Stallone's most underrated films from the 90's. An over looked gem that deserves to be seen again.

    A mid-Nineties action film starring Sylvester Stallone and directed by the helmer of the "Lethal Weapon" series hardly sounds like a recipe for greatness, does it? It's not the sort of the film that troubles award committees or quickens the heart-rate of critics. But audiences lap these sort of films up and especially guys who enjoy explosions and gun fights and various macho activities. Which I do but this effort never really steps it up and seems perfectly happy to remain in third gear without getting anywhere near top speed. Professional hit-man Robert Rath (Stallone) is looking to get out of the game as age starts to catch up with him. After he misses out on a contract thanks to rival Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), Rath is offered a shot at $2 million. The target is an anonymous electronics whiz (Julianne Moore) who's trying to arrange a deal with some shady Dutch types in Seattle. But Bain is never far behind and as Rath begins to question his orders, both of their lives are in danger. Stallone, looking much younger on the film's poster than he does in the movie, is a strangely monotone hero (if you can call someone who kills or money a hero) and at no point do you feel, support or root for him. Banderas is much more engaging but this is because he's an evil equivalent of El Mariachi from "Desperado". Gun in each hand and hair in front of his face, you know the look. Anyway, the pair of them tear through the scenery with plenty of gusto and the action is satisfying enough even if it is a little old-school. The plot is pretty formulaic and predictable - in fact, the only real surprise is the lack of a sex scene. So far, so what? It couldn't be any more average if it wanted to be but "Assassins" does have a couple of interesting trivia points. The script, written and then disowned by the Wachowski brothers (creators of the first 21st century action movie "The Matrix"), isn't as bad as they reckon but it doesn't offer anything new or different. The director, Richard Donner, knows his stuff when it comes to the action genre but it doesn't feel like a quality product - all the guns sound silenced for some reason and there is an explosion which is badly imposed on the footage and gives the sense of a budget being ran dry. I also can't figure out why they paid Stallone such a vast sum of money for his performance because for $15 million, I'd at least expect a flicker of emotion or some facial movement. But the only things that move on Stallone's head are his eyes and lips and personally, I wonder if the Wachowski's disowned the script after they'd seen the movie.

    This movie is really about removing that which is old to replace it with something that is new. Robert (Sylvester Stallone) is an assassin working for the US government. Fifteen years previously he assassinated his mentor Nicholai as he was leaving a bank so that he could become number one. Now a younger assassin, Miguel (Antonio Banderas) has appeared and he wants Robert's position. This movie is an action movie and is quite good. Donner creates a very dreamlike feel to the movie, which possibly means that what we have is not always going to be there. Personally that is just a wild guess. The bigger theme in the movie is the fear that somebody younger will appear that is much better than you and thus making you obsolete. The world in the movie is one of assassins, but this is very much true in the business world where the older people have to keep on their toes with the younger executives who want their job. Then there are the conservative established companies who are being challenged by the new innovative companies. Assassins portrays life, a life where we must watch out for the ambitious coming up from below us and remain alert as they attempt to take from us the position that they want. Yet there is also a time when we want to retire, when we wish to give up, and the thing assassins says is that we can never retire because even if we give up the race, the race always seeks to come along and forcefully remove us. Assassins is done in a dreamlike state because it is a reflection of the world in which we live.

    Howard Hawks allegedly said of his film "Rio Bravo" that "we enjoyed making it so much that we made it again". He was, of course, referring to "El Dorado" which although it is not officially a remake of "Rio Bravo" shares with it a very similar plot and the same leading man, John Wayne. Hawks and Wayne were later to make the same film for a third time, this time under the title "Rio Lobo". It would appear that, with six "Rockies" and four "Rambos" under his belt, Sylvester Stallone also enjoys making the same film several times. His 1994 outing, "The Specialist", never generated a franchise in this way, possibly because it was given a deservedly hostile reception by the critics. He did, however, follow it up the following year with the very similar "Assassins" which can be regarded as an unacknowledged remake. In both films Stallone plays hit-men who earn their living by murdering people, the main difference that Ray Quick from "The Specialist" prefers to use explosives, whereas Robert Rath, Sly's character here, uses a gun as his weapon of choice. Now you might think that this would make them the villains of the piece, but both are in fact treated as the heroes of their respective films. Hollywood has often tended to romanticise professional assassins, the more recent Bradgelina love-fest "Mr. and Mrs Smith" being a good example, and Messrs Quick and Rath can both be regarded as Good Murderers to whom falls the task of protecting the innocent from Bad Murderers. (In between "The Specialist" and "Assassins", Sly had made "Judge Dredd", in which he plays another type of Good Murderer). In "Assassins" the Bad Murderer is Miguel Bain, a rival hit-man even more ruthless than Rath himself. When Rath discovers that both he and Bain have been assigned by their "contractor" to kill the same "mark", a computer hacker named Electra, he has a change of heart and decides to protect her from Bain. Similarly in "The Specialist" Stallone found himself trying to protect an attractive girl, played there by Sharon Stone, from the attentions of another Bad Murderer (James Woods). Despite Rath's change of heart, the difference between him and Bain, as far as their code of ethics is concerned, is really only paper-thin. Perhaps it was for this reason that Stallone and Antonio Banderas, who plays Bain, decided to make their characters as different as possible in terms of styles of acting. Banderas plays Bain as an aggressive, cocky and hyper-active loudmouth, the sort of man the audience would loathe even if he were not a vicious killer. Rath, by contrast, is quiet, reserved and stony-faced. Rath's main motivation is financial, whereas Bain is obsessed with the psychological need to prove himself a better assassin than the older, more experienced Rath. (The idea of crime as a competitive sport is a common one in the cinema, another example being "Ocean's Twelve" which features a criminal whose motive for committing crimes is the desire to prove himself the best thief in the world). This film is more evidence that Julianne Moore's career has been a rather chequered one. (She plays Electra here). Although she has starred in excellent films like "Far from Heaven" or "The Hours", she has also acted in her fair share of rubbish, examples being "Body of Evidence" and the dreadful Gus van Sant remake of Hitchcock's "Psycho", both of them even worse films than this one. "Assassins" is not a truly appalling film like either of those two examples; Richard Donner, who made "The Omen", the original "Superman" and the "Lethal Weapon" series is a competent director of action movies, and at a basic technical level is not a bad film. My overall, view, however, would be similar to my opinion of "The Specialist", namely that it is an uninspired, routine thriller marred by a misguided attempt to glorify a murderer by turning him into a hero. 4/10

    Robert Rath (Sylvester Stallone) is a professional killer for hire. Robert is tired of the business and he is willing to do one last hit before he retired. When Robert takes the job to kill his next target, he finds out that job is already taking care of by a ruthless killer by the name of Miguel Bien (Antonio Banderas). Robert finds out that he is double crossed by the mysterious person, who hires him for the job. Now Robert is forced to take five hits to financially allow him to retire. But Miguel again beats him to the punch expect not killing the last hit, he didn't found. An attractive computer hacker (Julianne Moore), who finds herself between Robert and Miguel. Now she is forced to help Robert to find his mysterious contractor before Miguel gets to them. Directed by Richard Donner (The Lethal Weapon Series, Superman 1 & 2, 16 Blocks) made an watchable, although flawed suspense-thriller with some good action sequences. Stallone is fine as the morose professional hit man. Moore does well in her supporting role. But it is Banderas, who has an great time as the crazed killer for hire. The movie does have an great first-half, although it slows down during the second half. Although an box office disappointment, "Assassins" does have an cult following and the movie is played often on TV. The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix Trilogy, Bound, Speed Racer) originally wrote the story and screenplay before it was heavily re-written by Oscar-Winner:Brian Helgeland (A Nightmare on Elm Street 4:The Dream Master, L.A. Confidential, Payback). Which the Wachowski Brothers tried to remove their names from the credits. "Assassins" is a extremely well made movie that could have been greater but falls short. It is certainly worth watching for the skilled action-set sequences and Banderas' amusingly over the top performance. (*** &frac12;/*****).
