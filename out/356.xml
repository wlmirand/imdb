  Mark Sway is an 11 year old boy who lives with his mother and brother in a trailer. One day he and his brother are hanging out when a car pulls over beside them. The driver then sticks a hose in his exhaust and puts the other end into the car. Mark pulls it out. But the man sees him and grabs him and takes inside the car. The man talks to Mark then later shoots himself. The shock sends Mark's brother into a catatonic state. The police question him and slips out some stuff that makes them think he's saying more than he knows. Roy Foltrigg, a prosecutor with political ambitions tells Mark he wants to talk to him tomorrow. Mark feeling that he needs a lawyer, sees Reggie Love. Mark tells him about the man who killed himself. Reggie tells him he's a mob lawyer. And one of his clients is a member of a mob family who is suspected of killing a Senator who was trying to take down his family. But because the Senator's body is missing, they can't prosecute him. Reggie thinks Foltrigg thinks the...

    I read the book "The Client" when I was about as old as the titular character. I remember being scandalized by the idea of kids my age smoking (I was a tad sheltered) and that was enough to get my interest. It took me two days to read the book, lazy days at my grandparent's summer home over the fourth of July. In fact, I was so hooked by the book I fought my family about going out to see the fireworks. I just couldn't step away! Grisham books are usually formulaic but well-constructed. The same can be said for this movie. The script is pretty good, although there is A LOT of expository dialog in the first twenty minutes or so. Nearly every scene either advances the plot by raising the stakes or works to flesh out the main players. The conclusion is somewhat contrived (as it was in the book) and everything gets wrapped up neatly in the end. However, it's still satisfying. The film is rife with clich&eacute;d situations and familiar archetypal characters, but the great performances by the entire cast generally make up for it. the greatest strength of the film are the protagonists played by Susan Sarandon and Brad Renfro. These characters are well-developed and expertly portrayed. Sarandon steals the show but young Renfro does an amazing job keeping up with her. he was such an underrated actor whose private life unfortunately overshadowed his huge talent in the eyes of many. He really had the potential to be a huge A-lister. Of course, Tommy Lee Jones is great and his interplay with Sarandon is a joy to watch. Although he is not exactly the "good guy", his character is easy to like. Probably the main issue (and it's likely so in the book as well, I can't remember)is that while the protagonists are well-developed and interesting, the villains come straight from central casting. I have to say, such well-developed heroes deserve more interesting enemies! Overall though, very nice and memorable thriller. The film is not the pinnacle of its genre but still quite excellent.

    I finally sat down to watch this. I'm not big into 'lawyer' movies, and this plot never made much sense, but it got three stars on the tivo, so I said "sure, why not". First off, to be clear, I never read the book, nor have I read any Grisham novels. I never got the plot. Kid somehow finds out 'important' information, but won't tell anyone. Sounds, um, reasonable, sure. He then races to find a lawyer (and he doesn't trust lawyers) in order not to say anything. And I'm still not sure what the lawyer did for him, except get his family out of Memphis (which the DA should have been doing immediately). I couldn't stand ANY of the characters! Mark Sway just swore a lot and didn't have a clue what he was doing (and some people call him the 'hero'!). Not sure what Reggie the lawyer was trying to protect the boy from, for she seemed far more concerned over the law then the bad guys. The Barry 'the Blade' character made me wonder whether he was some guy who was posing as a mob killer, and thought that's how they dressed and acted. For he seemed as far from realistic as one could get. The cop that finds Mark has got to be one of the worst cops in Memphis. Kid finds body, you think he's hiding something. So the obvious way to get him to talk? Of course, try to scare it out of him! It always works! The federal agents seemed to be about as inept as possible. The DA made me wonder why anyone would pay attention to him, let alone the media. The family is in the hospital under police watch, but there's a detective down the hall watching the room? How does that happen? Speaking of the media, how about the supposed newspaper reporter. Taking pictures of the kid in the hospital room? Really? And the newspaper not only gave out his name, but printed a big picture of him? Finally, this is all about 'finding the body of the senator', but they never explained WHY that was important. A body is just a body. Sure, it can show the senator is truly dead. But not once did we hear "If we can find the body, we're sure to find proof that the blade did this!". Let alone, why would they think they could find it? Had they ever found any of his other victims? And did those not help send him to jail? Oh, and I didn't even get to the part where they go to NO to find the body for some insane reason. Anyone who thinks this is even a good movie needs to watch some good movies. Watch the Shawshank Redemption, and then watch this, and you'll see what I mean.

    first off I want to say even for all the plot holes in this movie it is still an OK movie to watch. But I just could not find it as enjoyable as I could when the kid you have to root for is a snot nosed little brat you want to smack the crap out of yourself. Saying that though even for when this movie was made the outstanding mistakes made by the legal part of this movie is beyond me. First off you have a cop intimidating a child witness which makes no sense, second when Mark was first brought in to talk to the lawyers they never would have anyway interviewed him without his mother because any defense lawyer would then tear apart the kids statement as soon as he took the stand and have all evidence thrown out of court, thirdly this is all based on what the lawyer might have told the kid which considering there is no proof they could ever possibly know what was actually talked about in the car all, all mark had to say was the guy just talked about wanting to die and the FBI could never prove otherwise and everything would once again be thrown out, fourth and finally even if Mark admitted that the lawyer told him something the FBI couldn't do anything with it because it is hearsay and also it broke client confidentiality as soon as the lawyer told Mark so it in no way could have been used as evidence and any evidence gotten from it would become invalid and not usable in a court of law. Also at one point in the movie the FBI hears on a wire tap the guy they want pretty much admitting to the crime and to wanting to whack the kid which is more than enough evidence they need to arrest him. OK movie but just full of to many plot holes to make any real sense.

    The Client is a good film with moments of extreme greatness especially for a courtroom thriller such as this. But there are also scenes where they should have been added into the editing room. The film was excellent in the beginning, slows to a crawl in the middle, and picks up in the end. If it stayed like the beginning, this film would have been flawless. After a 11-year-old kid and his brother witnessed a suicide, the kid hires an attorney to help protect him and his family from threatening mafia members and a stubborn Federal District attorney. The acting is very good in this film. Susan Sarandon seemed like she was born to play this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old. Overall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this film. I rate this film 8/10.

    Lots of overacting and horrible fake Southern accents. A bit of ridiculous stuff in an otherwise good movie. Why can't they find Southern people to play these parts? Why do they insist on using actors and actresses that probably have never been to the South? We don't talk that way down here. We just DON'T! Watching it threw me off. The only real diction and pronunciation was the black judge; he was great. Real. Watching Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones act Southern is painful. I have to go on because I'm supposed to write at least ten lines of content but we Southerners don't need to rattle on to make a point. The bottom line for Hollywood: hire Southern actors to play Southern-based roles!

    I remember this as a great movie by Sarandon (Dead Man Walking), who got an Oscar nomination out of her performance in a year of great movies, the best being, of course, Four Weddings and a Funeral. Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, JFK) was super as the Rev. Roy, and the lovely and talented Mary-Louise Parker ("Weeds", "Angels in America") was great as Mark's (Brad Renfro) mom. Anthony LaPaglia was just the embodiment of evil as Barry Muldano. The supporting cast reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood: J.T. Walsh, William H. Macy, Bradley Whitford, Anthony Edwards, Ossie Davis, and more.

    Ironically enough I saw a Perry Mason episode a few days earlier where a young kid around Brad Renfro's age comes to Raymond Burr seeking legal advice and got taken on as a client eventually. I wonder if John Grisham saw the episode and got the germ of an idea for a book. Renfro is a most wanted individual. He saw a lawyer from New Orleans kill himself and before he died he revealed where the missing body of a Louisiana State Senator was. It seems as though organized crime put a hit on him and the discovery of said body will cinch an indictment against Anthony LaPaglia the number one contract killer in the New Orleans mob. So US Attorney Tommy Lee Jones wants Renfro. LaPaglia wants to silence him. It's all way too overwhelming for Renfro's mother, some poor white trash woman played by Mary Louise Parker. And too overwhelming for Renfro who finds Susan Sarandon as an attorney who will guard his interests. Susan Sarandon got a Best Actress nomination for this film and on the strength of her scenes as a righteous attorney guarding Renfro's interests and her very tender scenes with Renfro earning his trust which was not easy. Sarandon hits all the right notes and every emotion from her in this film rings true to life. Brad Renfro was a complete unknown who was cast in the film because he was a local kid and he does come across as a real kid and very well. Half of Sarandon's nomination should have been credited to him. Sad indeed that he proved to be another young Hollywood tragedy. Down in the cast in a small part that he really makes count is Ossie Davis playing a judge who is trying to sort out everyone's rights in this situation. Davis was a great authority figure on the bench. John Grisham novels have such interesting characters they seem to be almost ready made for a screen adaption. The Client is no exception here, you will be engrossed in the story within seconds of starting to watch this film.

    This film is about a young boy who witnessed the suicide of a mafia lawyer. "The Client" tells the thrilling story about a young boy who has to deal with the horror of witnessing a death, the subsequent legal battle and persecution from the mafia. The story is very intense, it grips me and keeps me on edge throughout. I feel for the poor boy who has the misfortune to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I also want to highlight Reggie Love's selfless kindness to help Mark in the first place. She is a really kind person to help a kid who happens to enter an attorney's office, who might be dismissed as buffing. "The Client" is an intense and engaging drama. I enjoyed it a lot.

    A sterling cast headed by Oscar-nominated Susan Sarandon makes this slick thriller one of the better adaptations of a John Grisham bestseller,The Client.The film stars Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones and Brad Renfro together with Mary-Louise Parker,Anthony LaPaglia,Anthony Edwards and Ossie Davis.It was based on Grisham's bestselling novel about a street-wise kid, Mark Sway, sees the suicide of Jerome Clifford, a prominent Louisiana lawyer, whose current client is Barry 'The Blade' Muldano, a Mafia hit-man who killed Senator Boyd Boyette.It was written by Robert Getchell; together with Akiva Goldsman and it was directed by Joel Schumacher,both of whom worked in another Grisham adaptation, A Time To Kill. Mark Sway witnesses the suicide of a Mafia lawyer, who confesses that the Mob was behind the murder of a U.S. senator. Mark's brother is traumatized into a coma by the incident; gangster Barry Muldano is soon on Mark's trail, and in desperation, he arrives at the office of recovering alcoholic lawyer Reggie Love. With the Mob after them, and a ruthless federal attorney trying to force Mark to reveal what he knows, Love battles to guarantee the safety of her client and his family. The relationship between Reggie Love and Mark Sway is the center of the film, adding considerable character development to plot's routine elements. This legal thriller isn't a masterpiece of suspense but it has its moments and is capable of providing entertainment.Susan Sarandon, the emotional center of the narrative, received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for playing a recovered alcoholic lawyer who interacts with the boy as a surrogate mother and a lawyer that holds the viewer's interest on the main characters of the story. Although the film was formulaic, it still is worth the view for it has a good story to tell.

Susan Sarandon got a Best Actress nomination for this film and on the strength of her scenes as a righteous attorney guarding Renfro's interests and her very tender scenes with Renfro earning his trust which was not easy. Sarandon hits all the right notes and every emotion from her in this film rings true to life. Brad Renfro was a complete unknown who was cast in the film because he was a local kid and he does come across as a real kid and very well. Half of Sarandon's nomination should have been credited to him. Sad indeed that he proved to be another young Hollywood tragedy. Down in the cast in a small part that he really makes count is Ossie Davis playing a judge who is trying to sort out everyone's rights in this situation. Davis was a great authority figure on the bench. John Grisham novels have such interesting characters they seem to be almost ready made for a screen adaption. The Client is no exception here, you will be engrossed in the story within seconds of starting to watch this film.

    This film is about a young boy who witnessed the suicide of a mafia lawyer. "The Client" tells the thrilling story about a young boy who has to deal with the horror of witnessing a death, the subsequent legal battle and persecution from the mafia. The story is very intense, it grips me and keeps me on edge throughout. I feel for the poor boy who has the misfortune to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I also want to highlight Reggie Love's selfless kindness to help Mark in the first place. She is a really kind person to help a kid who happens to enter an attorney's office, who might be dismissed as buffing. "The Client" is an intense and engaging drama. I enjoyed it a lot.

    A sterling cast headed by Oscar-nominated Susan Sarandon makes this slick thriller one of the better adaptations of a John Grisham bestseller,The Client.The film stars Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones and Brad Renfro together with Mary-Louise Parker,Anthony LaPaglia,Anthony Edwards and Ossie Davis.It was based on Grisham's bestselling novel about a street-wise kid, Mark Sway, sees the suicide of Jerome Clifford, a prominent Louisiana lawyer, whose current client is Barry 'The Blade' Muldano, a Mafia hit-man who killed Senator Boyd Boyette.It was written by Robert Getchell; together with Akiva Goldsman and it was directed by Joel Schumacher,both of whom worked in another Grisham adaptation, A Time To Kill. Mark Sway witnesses the suicide of a Mafia lawyer, who confesses that the Mob was behind the murder of a U.S. senator. Mark's brother is traumatized into a coma by the incident; gangster Barry Muldano is soon on Mark's trail, and in desperation, he arrives at the office of recovering alcoholic lawyer Reggie Love. With the Mob after them, and a ruthless federal attorney trying to force Mark to reveal what he knows, Love battles to guarantee the safety of her client and his family. The relationship between Reggie Love and Mark Sway is the center of the film, adding considerable character development to plot's routine elements. This legal thriller isn't a masterpiece of suspense but it has its moments and is capable of providing entertainment.Susan Sarandon, the emotional center of the narrative, received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for playing a recovered alcoholic lawyer who interacts with the boy as a surrogate mother and a lawyer that holds the viewer's interest on the main characters of the story. Although the film was formulaic, it still is worth the view for it has a good story to tell.

    I read the book "The Client" when I was about as old as the titular character. I remember being scandalized by the idea of kids my age smoking (I was a tad sheltered) and that was enough to get my interest. It took me two days to read the book, lazy days at my grandparent's summer home over the fourth of July. In fact, I was so hooked by the book I fought my family about going out to see the fireworks. I just couldn't step away! Grisham books are usually formulaic but well-constructed. The same can be said for this movie. The script is pretty good, although there is A LOT of expository dialog in the first twenty minutes or so. Nearly every scene either advances the plot by raising the stakes or works to flesh out the main players. The conclusion is somewhat contrived (as it was in the book) and everything gets wrapped up neatly in the end. However, it's still satisfying. The film is rife with clich&eacute;d situations and familiar archetypal characters, but the great performances by the entire cast generally make up for it. the greatest strength of the film are the protagonists played by Susan Sarandon and Brad Renfro. These characters are well-developed and expertly portrayed. Sarandon steals the show but young Renfro does an amazing job keeping up with her. he was such an underrated actor whose private life unfortunately overshadowed his huge talent in the eyes of many. He really had the potential to be a huge A-lister. Of course, Tommy Lee Jones is great and his interplay with Sarandon is a joy to watch. Although he is not exactly the "good guy", his character is easy to like. Probably the main issue (and it's likely so in the book as well, I can't remember)is that while the protagonists are well-developed and interesting, the villains come straight from central casting. I have to say, such well-developed heroes deserve more interesting enemies! Overall though, very nice and memorable thriller. The film is not the pinnacle of its genre but still quite excellent.

    I finally sat down to watch this. I'm not big into 'lawyer' movies, and this plot never made much sense, but it got three stars on the tivo, so I said "sure, why not". First off, to be clear, I never read the book, nor have I read any Grisham novels. I never got the plot. Kid somehow finds out 'important' information, but won't tell anyone. Sounds, um, reasonable, sure. He then races to find a lawyer (and he doesn't trust lawyers) in order not to say anything. And I'm still not sure what the lawyer did for him, except get his family out of Memphis (which the DA should have been doing immediately). I couldn't stand ANY of the characters! Mark Sway just swore a lot and didn't have a clue what he was doing (and some people call him the 'hero'!). Not sure what Reggie the lawyer was trying to protect the boy from, for she seemed far more concerned over the law then the bad guys. The Barry 'the Blade' character made me wonder whether he was some guy who was posing as a mob killer, and thought that's how they dressed and acted. For he seemed as far from realistic as one could get. The cop that finds Mark has got to be one of the worst cops in Memphis. Kid finds body, you think he's hiding something. So the obvious way to get him to talk? Of course, try to scare it out of him! It always works! The federal agents seemed to be about as inept as possible. The DA made me wonder why anyone would pay attention to him, let alone the media. The family is in the hospital under police watch, but there's a detective down the hall watching the room? How does that happen? Speaking of the media, how about the supposed newspaper reporter. Taking pictures of the kid in the hospital room? Really? And the newspaper not only gave out his name, but printed a big picture of him? Finally, this is all about 'finding the body of the senator', but they never explained WHY that was important. A body is just a body. Sure, it can show the senator is truly dead. But not once did we hear "If we can find the body, we're sure to find proof that the blade did this!". Let alone, why would they think they could find it? Had they ever found any of his other victims? And did those not help send him to jail? Oh, and I didn't even get to the part where they go to NO to find the body for some insane reason. Anyone who thinks this is even a good movie needs to watch some good movies. Watch the Shawshank Redemption, and then watch this, and you'll see what I mean.

    first off I want to say even for all the plot holes in this movie it is still an OK movie to watch. But I just could not find it as enjoyable as I could when the kid you have to root for is a snot nosed little brat you want to smack the crap out of yourself. Saying that though even for when this movie was made the outstanding mistakes made by the legal part of this movie is beyond me. First off you have a cop intimidating a child witness which makes no sense, second when Mark was first brought in to talk to the lawyers they never would have anyway interviewed him without his mother because any defense lawyer would then tear apart the kids statement as soon as he took the stand and have all evidence thrown out of court, thirdly this is all based on what the lawyer might have told the kid which considering there is no proof they could ever possibly know what was actually talked about in the car all, all mark had to say was the guy just talked about wanting to die and the FBI could never prove otherwise and everything would once again be thrown out, fourth and finally even if Mark admitted that the lawyer told him something the FBI couldn't do anything with it because it is hearsay and also it broke client confidentiality as soon as the lawyer told Mark so it in no way could have been used as evidence and any evidence gotten from it would become invalid and not usable in a court of law. Also at one point in the movie the FBI hears on a wire tap the guy they want pretty much admitting to the crime and to wanting to whack the kid which is more than enough evidence they need to arrest him. OK movie but just full of to many plot holes to make any real sense.

    The Client is a good film with moments of extreme greatness especially for a courtroom thriller such as this. But there are also scenes where they should have been added into the editing room. The film was excellent in the beginning, slows to a crawl in the middle, and picks up in the end. If it stayed like the beginning, this film would have been flawless. After a 11-year-old kid and his brother witnessed a suicide, the kid hires an attorney to help protect him and his family from threatening mafia members and a stubborn Federal District attorney. The acting is very good in this film. Susan Sarandon seemed like she was born to play this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old. Overall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this film. I rate this film 8/10.

    Lots of overacting and horrible fake Southern accents. A bit of ridiculous stuff in an otherwise good movie. Why can't they find Southern people to play these parts? Why do they insist on using actors and actresses that probably have never been to the South? We don't talk that way down here. We just DON'T! Watching it threw me off. The only real diction and pronunciation was the black judge; he was great. Real. Watching Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones act Southern is painful. I have to go on because I'm supposed to write at least ten lines of content but we Southerners don't need to rattle on to make a point. The bottom line for Hollywood: hire Southern actors to play Southern-based roles!

    I remember this as a great movie by Sarandon (Dead Man Walking), who got an Oscar nomination out of her performance in a year of great movies, the best being, of course, Four Weddings and a Funeral. Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, JFK) was super as the Rev. Roy, and the lovely and talented Mary-Louise Parker ("Weeds", "Angels in America") was great as Mark's (Brad Renfro) mom. Anthony LaPaglia was just the embodiment of evil as Barry Muldano. The supporting cast reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood: J.T. Walsh, William H. Macy, Bradley Whitford, Anthony Edwards, Ossie Davis, and more.

    Ironically enough I saw a Perry Mason episode a few days earlier where a young kid around Brad Renfro's age comes to Raymond Burr seeking legal advice and got taken on as a client eventually. I wonder if John Grisham saw the episode and got the germ of an idea for a book. Renfro is a most wanted individual. He saw a lawyer from New Orleans kill himself and before he died he revealed where the missing body of a Louisiana State Senator was. It seems as though organized crime put a hit on him and the discovery of said body will cinch an indictment against Anthony LaPaglia the number one contract killer in the New Orleans mob. So US Attorney Tommy Lee Jones wants Renfro. LaPaglia wants to silence him. It's all way too overwhelming for Renfro's mother, some poor white trash woman played by Mary Louise Parker. And too overwhelming for Renfro who finds Susan Sarandon as an attorney who will guard his interests. Susan Sarandon got a Best Actress nomination for this film and on the strength of her scenes as a righteous attorney guarding Renfro's interests and her very tender scenes with Renfro earning his trust which was not easy. Sarandon hits all the right notes and every emotion from her in this film rings true to life. Brad Renfro was a complete unknown who was cast in the film because he was a local kid and he does come across as a real kid and very well.

Davis was a great authority figure on the bench. John Grisham novels have such interesting characters they seem to be almost ready made for a screen adaption.

Macy, Bradley Whitford, Anthony Edwards, Ossie Davis, and more.

    Ironically enough I saw a Perry Mason episode a few days earlier where a young kid around Brad Renfro's age comes to Raymond Burr seeking legal advice and got taken on as a client eventually. I wonder if John Grisham saw the episode and got the germ of an idea for a book. Renfro is a most wanted individual. He saw a lawyer from New Orleans kill himself and before he died he revealed where the missing body of a Louisiana State Senator was. It seems as though organized crime put a hit on him and the discovery of said body will cinch an indictment against Anthony LaPaglia the number one contract killer in the New Orleans mob. So US Attorney Tommy Lee Jones wants Renfro. LaPaglia wants to silence him. It's all way too overwhelming for Renfro's mother, some poor white trash woman played by Mary Louise Parker. And too overwhelming for Renfro who finds Susan Sarandon as an attorney who will guard his interests. Susan Sarandon got a Best Actress nomination for this film and on the strength of her scenes as a righteous attorney guarding Renfro's interests and her very tender scenes with Renfro earning his trust which was not easy. Sarandon hits all the right notes and every emotion from her in this film rings true to life. Brad Renfro was a complete unknown who was cast in the film because he was a local kid and he does come across as a real kid and very well. Half of Sarandon's nomination should have been credited to him. Sad indeed that he proved to be another young Hollywood tragedy. Down in the cast in a small part that he really makes count is Ossie Davis playing a judge who is trying to sort out everyone's rights in this situation. Davis was a great authority figure on the bench. John Grisham novels have such interesting characters they seem to be almost ready made for a screen adaption. The Client is no exception here, you will be engrossed in the story within seconds of starting to watch this film.

    This film is about a young boy who witnessed the suicide of a mafia lawyer. "The Client" tells the thrilling story about a young boy who has to deal with the horror of witnessing a death, the subsequent legal battle and persecution from the mafia. The story is very intense, it grips me and keeps me on edge throughout. I feel for the poor boy who has the misfortune to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I also want to highlight Reggie Love's selfless kindness to help Mark in the first place. She is a really kind person to help a kid who happens to enter an attorney's office, who might be dismissed as buffing. "The Client" is an intense and engaging drama. I enjoyed it a lot.

    A sterling cast headed by Oscar-nominated Susan Sarandon makes this slick thriller one of the better adaptations of a John Grisham bestseller,The Client.The film stars Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones and Brad Renfro together with Mary-Louise Parker,Anthony LaPaglia,Anthony Edwards and Ossie Davis.It was based on Grisham's bestselling novel about a street-wise kid, Mark Sway, sees the suicide of Jerome Clifford, a prominent Louisiana lawyer, whose current client is Barry 'The Blade' Muldano, a Mafia hit-man who killed Senator Boyd Boyette.It was written by Robert Getchell; together with Akiva Goldsman and it was directed by Joel Schumacher,both of whom worked in another Grisham adaptation, A Time To Kill. Mark Sway witnesses the suicide of a Mafia lawyer, who confesses that the Mob was behind the murder of a U.S. senator. Mark's brother is traumatized into a coma by the incident; gangster Barry Muldano is soon on Mark's trail, and in desperation, he arrives at the office of recovering alcoholic lawyer Reggie Love. With the Mob after them, and a ruthless federal attorney trying to force Mark to reveal what he knows, Love battles to guarantee the safety of her client and his family. The relationship between Reggie Love and Mark Sway is the center of the film, adding considerable character development to plot's routine elements. This legal thriller isn't a masterpiece of suspense but it has its moments and is capable of providing entertainment.Susan Sarandon, the emotional center of the narrative, received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for playing a recovered alcoholic lawyer who interacts with the boy as a surrogate mother and a lawyer that holds the viewer's interest on the main characters of the story. Although the film was formulaic, it still is worth the view for it has a good story to tell.

    I read the book "The Client" when I was about as old as the titular character. I remember being scandalized by the idea of kids my age smoking (I was a tad sheltered) and that was enough to get my interest. It took me two days to read the book, lazy days at my grandparent's summer home over the fourth of July. In fact, I was so hooked by the book I fought my family about going out to see the fireworks. I just couldn't step away! Grisham books are usually formulaic but well-constructed. The same can be said for this movie. The script is pretty good, although there is A LOT of expository dialog in the first twenty minutes or so. Nearly every scene either advances the plot by raising the stakes or works to flesh out the main players. The conclusion is somewhat contrived (as it was in the book) and everything gets wrapped up neatly in the end. However, it's still satisfying. The film is rife with clich&eacute;d situations and familiar archetypal characters, but the great performances by the entire cast generally make up for it. the greatest strength of the film are the protagonists played by Susan Sarandon and Brad Renfro. These characters are well-developed and expertly portrayed. Sarandon steals the show but young Renfro does an amazing job keeping up with her. he was such an underrated actor whose private life unfortunately overshadowed his huge talent in the eyes of many. He really had the potential to be a huge A-lister. Of course, Tommy Lee Jones is great and his interplay with Sarandon is a joy to watch. Although he is not exactly the "good guy", his character is easy to like. Probably the main issue (and it's likely so in the book as well, I can't remember)is that while the protagonists are well-developed and interesting, the villains come straight from central casting. I have to say, such well-developed heroes deserve more interesting enemies! Overall though, very nice and memorable thriller. The film is not the pinnacle of its genre but still quite excellent.

    I finally sat down to watch this. I'm not big into 'lawyer' movies, and this plot never made much sense, but it got three stars on the tivo, so I said "sure, why not". First off, to be clear, I never read the book, nor have I read any Grisham novels. I never got the plot. Kid somehow finds out 'important' information, but won't tell anyone. Sounds, um, reasonable, sure. He then races to find a lawyer (and he doesn't trust lawyers) in order not to say anything. And I'm still not sure what the lawyer did for him, except get his family out of Memphis (which the DA should have been doing immediately). I couldn't stand ANY of the characters! Mark Sway just swore a lot and didn't have a clue what he was doing (and some people call him the 'hero'!). Not sure what Reggie the lawyer was trying to protect the boy from, for she seemed far more concerned over the law then the bad guys. The Barry 'the Blade' character made me wonder whether he was some guy who was posing as a mob killer, and thought that's how they dressed and acted. For he seemed as far from realistic as one could get. The cop that finds Mark has got to be one of the worst cops in Memphis. Kid finds body, you think he's hiding something. So the obvious way to get him to talk? Of course, try to scare it out of him! It always works! The federal agents seemed to be about as inept as possible. The DA made me wonder why anyone would pay attention to him, let alone the media. The family is in the hospital under police watch, but there's a detective down the hall watching the room? How does that happen? Speaking of the media, how about the supposed newspaper reporter. Taking pictures of the kid in the hospital room? Really? And the newspaper not only gave out his name, but printed a big picture of him? Finally, this is all about 'finding the body of the senator', but they never explained WHY that was important. A body is just a body. Sure, it can show the senator is truly dead. But not once did we hear "If we can find the body, we're sure to find proof that the blade did this!". Let alone, why would they think they could find it? Had they ever found any of his other victims? And did those not help send him to jail? Oh, and I didn't even get to the part where they go to NO to find the body for some insane reason. Anyone who thinks this is even a good movie needs to watch some good movies. Watch the Shawshank Redemption, and then watch this, and you'll see what I mean.

    first off I want to say even for all the plot holes in this movie it is still an OK movie to watch. But I just could not find it as enjoyable as I could when the kid you have to root for is a snot nosed little brat you want to smack the crap out of yourself. Saying that though even for when this movie was made the outstanding mistakes made by the legal part of this movie is beyond me. First off you have a cop intimidating a child witness which makes no sense, second when Mark was first brought in to talk to the lawyers they never would have anyway interviewed him without his mother because any defense lawyer would then tear apart the kids statement as soon as he took the stand and have all evidence thrown out of court, thirdly this is all based on what the lawyer might have told the kid which considering there is no proof they could ever possibly know what was actually talked about in the car all, all mark had to say was the guy just talked about wanting to die and the FBI could never prove otherwise and everything would once again be thrown out, fourth and finally even if Mark admitted that the lawyer told him something the FBI couldn't do anything with it because it is hearsay and also it broke client confidentiality as soon as the lawyer told Mark so it in no way could have been used as evidence and any evidence gotten from it would become invalid and not usable in a court of law. Also at one point in the movie the FBI hears on a wire tap the guy they want pretty much admitting to the crime and to wanting to whack the kid which is more than enough evidence they need to arrest him. OK movie but just full of to many plot holes to make any real sense.

    The Client is a good film with moments of extreme greatness especially for a courtroom thriller such as this. But there are also scenes where they should have been added into the editing room. The film was excellent in the beginning, slows to a crawl in the middle, and picks up in the end. If it stayed like the beginning, this film would have been flawless. After a 11-year-old kid and his brother witnessed a suicide, the kid hires an attorney to help protect him and his family from threatening mafia members and a stubborn Federal District attorney. The acting is very good in this film. Susan Sarandon seemed like she was born to play this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old. Overall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this film. I rate this film 8/10.

    Lots of overacting and horrible fake Southern accents. A bit of ridiculous stuff in an otherwise good movie. Why can't they find Southern people to play these parts? Why do they insist on using actors and actresses that probably have never been to the South? We don't talk that way down here. We just DON'T! Watching it threw me off. The only real diction and pronunciation was the black judge; he was great. Real. Watching Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones act Southern is painful. I have to go on because I'm supposed to write at least ten lines of content but we Southerners don't need to rattle on to make a point. The bottom line for Hollywood: hire Southern actors to play Southern-based roles!

    I remember this as a great movie by Sarandon (Dead Man Walking), who got an Oscar nomination out of her performance in a year of great movies, the best being, of course, Four Weddings and a Funeral. Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, JFK) was super as the Rev. Roy, and the lovely and talented Mary-Louise Parker ("Weeds", "Angels in America") was great as Mark's (Brad Renfro) mom. Anthony LaPaglia was just the embodiment of evil as Barry Muldano. The supporting cast reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood: J.T. Walsh, William H.

Why do they insist on using actors and actresses that probably have never been to the South? We don't talk that way down here. We just DON'T! Watching it threw me off. The only real diction and pronunciation was the black judge; he was great. Real. Watching Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones act Southern is painful. I have to go on because I'm supposed to write at least ten lines of content but we Southerners don't need to rattle on to make a point. The bottom line for Hollywood: hire Southern actors to play Southern-based roles!

    I remember this as a great movie by Sarandon (Dead Man Walking), who got an Oscar nomination out of her performance in a year of great movies, the best being, of course, Four Weddings and a Funeral. Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, JFK) was super as the Rev. Roy, and the lovely and talented Mary-Louise Parker ("Weeds", "Angels in America") was great as Mark's (Brad Renfro) mom. Anthony LaPaglia was just the embodiment of evil as Barry Muldano. The supporting cast reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood: J.T. Walsh, William H. Macy, Bradley Whitford, Anthony Edwards, Ossie Davis, and more.

    Ironically enough I saw a Perry Mason episode a few days earlier where a young kid around Brad Renfro's age comes to Raymond Burr seeking legal advice and got taken on as a client eventually. I wonder if John Grisham saw the episode and got the germ of an idea for a book. Renfro is a most wanted individual. He saw a lawyer from New Orleans kill himself and before he died he revealed where the missing body of a Louisiana State Senator was. It seems as though organized crime put a hit on him and the discovery of said body will cinch an indictment against Anthony LaPaglia the number one contract killer in the New Orleans mob. So US Attorney Tommy Lee Jones wants Renfro. LaPaglia wants to silence him. It's all way too overwhelming for Renfro's mother, some poor white trash woman played by Mary Louise Parker. And too overwhelming for Renfro who finds Susan Sarandon as an attorney who will guard his interests. Susan Sarandon got a Best Actress nomination for this film and on the strength of her scenes as a righteous attorney guarding Renfro's interests and her very tender scenes with Renfro earning his trust which was not easy. Sarandon hits all the right notes and every emotion from her in this film rings true to life. Brad Renfro was a complete unknown who was cast in the film because he was a local kid and he does come across as a real kid and very well. Half of Sarandon's nomination should have been credited to him. Sad indeed that he proved to be another young Hollywood tragedy. Down in the cast in a small part that he really makes count is Ossie Davis playing a judge who is trying to sort out everyone's rights in this situation. Davis was a great authority figure on the bench. John Grisham novels have such interesting characters they seem to be almost ready made for a screen adaption. The Client is no exception here, you will be engrossed in the story within seconds of starting to watch this film.

    This film is about a young boy who witnessed the suicide of a mafia lawyer. "The Client" tells the thrilling story about a young boy who has to deal with the horror of witnessing a death, the subsequent legal battle and persecution from the mafia. The story is very intense, it grips me and keeps me on edge throughout. I feel for the poor boy who has the misfortune to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I also want to highlight Reggie Love's selfless kindness to help Mark in the first place. She is a really kind person to help a kid who happens to enter an attorney's office, who might be dismissed as buffing. "The Client" is an intense and engaging drama. I enjoyed it a lot.

    A sterling cast headed by Oscar-nominated Susan Sarandon makes this slick thriller one of the better adaptations of a John Grisham bestseller,The Client.The film stars Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones and Brad Renfro together with Mary-Louise Parker,Anthony LaPaglia,Anthony Edwards and Ossie Davis.It was based on Grisham's bestselling novel about a street-wise kid, Mark Sway, sees the suicide of Jerome Clifford, a prominent Louisiana lawyer, whose current client is Barry 'The Blade' Muldano, a Mafia hit-man who killed Senator Boyd Boyette.It was written by Robert Getchell; together with Akiva Goldsman and it was directed by Joel Schumacher,both of whom worked in another Grisham adaptation, A Time To Kill. Mark Sway witnesses the suicide of a Mafia lawyer, who confesses that the Mob was behind the murder of a U.S. senator. Mark's brother is traumatized into a coma by the incident; gangster Barry Muldano is soon on Mark's trail, and in desperation, he arrives at the office of recovering alcoholic lawyer Reggie Love. With the Mob after them, and a ruthless federal attorney trying to force Mark to reveal what he knows, Love battles to guarantee the safety of her client and his family. The relationship between Reggie Love and Mark Sway is the center of the film, adding considerable character development to plot's routine elements. This legal thriller isn't a masterpiece of suspense but it has its moments and is capable of providing entertainment.Susan Sarandon, the emotional center of the narrative, received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for playing a recovered alcoholic lawyer who interacts with the boy as a surrogate mother and a lawyer that holds the viewer's interest on the main characters of the story. Although the film was formulaic, it still is worth the view for it has a good story to tell.

    I read the book "The Client" when I was about as old as the titular character. I remember being scandalized by the idea of kids my age smoking (I was a tad sheltered) and that was enough to get my interest. It took me two days to read the book, lazy days at my grandparent's summer home over the fourth of July. In fact, I was so hooked by the book I fought my family about going out to see the fireworks. I just couldn't step away! Grisham books are usually formulaic but well-constructed. The same can be said for this movie. The script is pretty good, although there is A LOT of expository dialog in the first twenty minutes or so. Nearly every scene either advances the plot by raising the stakes or works to flesh out the main players. The conclusion is somewhat contrived (as it was in the book) and everything gets wrapped up neatly in the end. However, it's still satisfying. The film is rife with clich&eacute;d situations and familiar archetypal characters, but the great performances by the entire cast generally make up for it. the greatest strength of the film are the protagonists played by Susan Sarandon and Brad Renfro. These characters are well-developed and expertly portrayed. Sarandon steals the show but young Renfro does an amazing job keeping up with her. he was such an underrated actor whose private life unfortunately overshadowed his huge talent in the eyes of many. He really had the potential to be a huge A-lister. Of course, Tommy Lee Jones is great and his interplay with Sarandon is a joy to watch. Although he is not exactly the "good guy", his character is easy to like. Probably the main issue (and it's likely so in the book as well, I can't remember)is that while the protagonists are well-developed and interesting, the villains come straight from central casting. I have to say, such well-developed heroes deserve more interesting enemies! Overall though, very nice and memorable thriller. The film is not the pinnacle of its genre but still quite excellent.

    I finally sat down to watch this. I'm not big into 'lawyer' movies, and this plot never made much sense, but it got three stars on the tivo, so I said "sure, why not". First off, to be clear, I never read the book, nor have I read any Grisham novels. I never got the plot. Kid somehow finds out 'important' information, but won't tell anyone. Sounds, um, reasonable, sure. He then races to find a lawyer (and he doesn't trust lawyers) in order not to say anything. And I'm still not sure what the lawyer did for him, except get his family out of Memphis (which the DA should have been doing immediately). I couldn't stand ANY of the characters! Mark Sway just swore a lot and didn't have a clue what he was doing (and some people call him the 'hero'!). Not sure what Reggie the lawyer was trying to protect the boy from, for she seemed far more concerned over the law then the bad guys. The Barry 'the Blade' character made me wonder whether he was some guy who was posing as a mob killer, and thought that's how they dressed and acted. For he seemed as far from realistic as one could get. The cop that finds Mark has got to be one of the worst cops in Memphis. Kid finds body, you think he's hiding something. So the obvious way to get him to talk? Of course, try to scare it out of him! It always works! The federal agents seemed to be about as inept as possible. The DA made me wonder why anyone would pay attention to him, let alone the media. The family is in the hospital under police watch, but there's a detective down the hall watching the room? How does that happen? Speaking of the media, how about the supposed newspaper reporter. Taking pictures of the kid in the hospital room? Really? And the newspaper not only gave out his name, but printed a big picture of him? Finally, this is all about 'finding the body of the senator', but they never explained WHY that was important. A body is just a body. Sure, it can show the senator is truly dead. But not once did we hear "If we can find the body, we're sure to find proof that the blade did this!". Let alone, why would they think they could find it? Had they ever found any of his other victims? And did those not help send him to jail? Oh, and I didn't even get to the part where they go to NO to find the body for some insane reason. Anyone who thinks this is even a good movie needs to watch some good movies. Watch the Shawshank Redemption, and then watch this, and you'll see what I mean.

    first off I want to say even for all the plot holes in this movie it is still an OK movie to watch. But I just could not find it as enjoyable as I could when the kid you have to root for is a snot nosed little brat you want to smack the crap out of yourself. Saying that though even for when this movie was made the outstanding mistakes made by the legal part of this movie is beyond me. First off you have a cop intimidating a child witness which makes no sense, second when Mark was first brought in to talk to the lawyers they never would have anyway interviewed him without his mother because any defense lawyer would then tear apart the kids statement as soon as he took the stand and have all evidence thrown out of court, thirdly this is all based on what the lawyer might have told the kid which considering there is no proof they could ever possibly know what was actually talked about in the car all, all mark had to say was the guy just talked about wanting to die and the FBI could never prove otherwise and everything would once again be thrown out, fourth and finally even if Mark admitted that the lawyer told him something the FBI couldn't do anything with it because it is hearsay and also it broke client confidentiality as soon as the lawyer told Mark so it in no way could have been used as evidence and any evidence gotten from it would become invalid and not usable in a court of law. Also at one point in the movie the FBI hears on a wire tap the guy they want pretty much admitting to the crime and to wanting to whack the kid which is more than enough evidence they need to arrest him. OK movie but just full of to many plot holes to make any real sense.

    The Client is a good film with moments of extreme greatness especially for a courtroom thriller such as this. But there are also scenes where they should have been added into the editing room. The film was excellent in the beginning, slows to a crawl in the middle, and picks up in the end. If it stayed like the beginning, this film would have been flawless. After a 11-year-old kid and his brother witnessed a suicide, the kid hires an attorney to help protect him and his family from threatening mafia members and a stubborn Federal District attorney. The acting is very good in this film. Susan Sarandon seemed like she was born to play this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old. Overall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this film. I rate this film 8/10.

After a 11-year-old kid and his brother witnessed a suicide, the kid hires an attorney to help protect him and his family from threatening mafia members and a stubborn Federal District attorney. The acting is very good in this film. Susan Sarandon seemed like she was born to play this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old. Overall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this film. I rate this film 8/10.

    Lots of overacting and horrible fake Southern accents. A bit of ridiculous stuff in an otherwise good movie. Why can't they find Southern people to play these parts? Why do they insist on using actors and actresses that probably have never been to the South? We don't talk that way down here. We just DON'T! Watching it threw me off. The only real diction and pronunciation was the black judge; he was great. Real. Watching Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones act Southern is painful. I have to go on because I'm supposed to write at least ten lines of content but we Southerners don't need to rattle on to make a point. The bottom line for Hollywood: hire Southern actors to play Southern-based roles!

    I remember this as a great movie by Sarandon (Dead Man Walking), who got an Oscar nomination out of her performance in a year of great movies, the best being, of course, Four Weddings and a Funeral. Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, JFK) was super as the Rev. Roy, and the lovely and talented Mary-Louise Parker ("Weeds", "Angels in America") was great as Mark's (Brad Renfro) mom. Anthony LaPaglia was just the embodiment of evil as Barry Muldano. The supporting cast reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood: J.T. Walsh, William H. Macy, Bradley Whitford, Anthony Edwards, Ossie Davis, and more.

    Ironically enough I saw a Perry Mason episode a few days earlier where a young kid around Brad Renfro's age comes to Raymond Burr seeking legal advice and got taken on as a client eventually. I wonder if John Grisham saw the episode and got the germ of an idea for a book. Renfro is a most wanted individual. He saw a lawyer from New Orleans kill himself and before he died he revealed where the missing body of a Louisiana State Senator was. It seems as though organized crime put a hit on him and the discovery of said body will cinch an indictment against Anthony LaPaglia the number one contract killer in the New Orleans mob. So US Attorney Tommy Lee Jones wants Renfro. LaPaglia wants to silence him. It's all way too overwhelming for Renfro's mother, some poor white trash woman played by Mary Louise Parker. And too overwhelming for Renfro who finds Susan Sarandon as an attorney who will guard his interests. Susan Sarandon got a Best Actress nomination for this film and on the strength of her scenes as a righteous attorney guarding Renfro's interests and her very tender scenes with Renfro earning his trust which was not easy. Sarandon hits all the right notes and every emotion from her in this film rings true to life. Brad Renfro was a complete unknown who was cast in the film because he was a local kid and he does come across as a real kid and very well. Half of Sarandon's nomination should have been credited to him. Sad indeed that he proved to be another young Hollywood tragedy. Down in the cast in a small part that he really makes count is Ossie Davis playing a judge who is trying to sort out everyone's rights in this situation. Davis was a great authority figure on the bench. John Grisham novels have such interesting characters they seem to be almost ready made for a screen adaption. The Client is no exception here, you will be engrossed in the story within seconds of starting to watch this film.

    This film is about a young boy who witnessed the suicide of a mafia lawyer. "The Client" tells the thrilling story about a young boy who has to deal with the horror of witnessing a death, the subsequent legal battle and persecution from the mafia. The story is very intense, it grips me and keeps me on edge throughout. I feel for the poor boy who has the misfortune to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I also want to highlight Reggie Love's selfless kindness to help Mark in the first place. She is a really kind person to help a kid who happens to enter an attorney's office, who might be dismissed as buffing. "The Client" is an intense and engaging drama. I enjoyed it a lot.

    A sterling cast headed by Oscar-nominated Susan Sarandon makes this slick thriller one of the better adaptations of a John Grisham bestseller,The Client.The film stars Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones and Brad Renfro together with Mary-Louise Parker,Anthony LaPaglia,Anthony Edwards and Ossie Davis.It was based on Grisham's bestselling novel about a street-wise kid, Mark Sway, sees the suicide of Jerome Clifford, a prominent Louisiana lawyer, whose current client is Barry 'The Blade' Muldano, a Mafia hit-man who killed Senator Boyd Boyette.It was written by Robert Getchell; together with Akiva Goldsman and it was directed by Joel Schumacher,both of whom worked in another Grisham adaptation, A Time To Kill. Mark Sway witnesses the suicide of a Mafia lawyer, who confesses that the Mob was behind the murder of a U.S. senator. Mark's brother is traumatized into a coma by the incident; gangster Barry Muldano is soon on Mark's trail, and in desperation, he arrives at the office of recovering alcoholic lawyer Reggie Love. With the Mob after them, and a ruthless federal attorney trying to force Mark to reveal what he knows, Love battles to guarantee the safety of her client and his family. The relationship between Reggie Love and Mark Sway is the center of the film, adding considerable character development to plot's routine elements. This legal thriller isn't a masterpiece of suspense but it has its moments and is capable of providing entertainment.Susan Sarandon, the emotional center of the narrative, received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for playing a recovered alcoholic lawyer who interacts with the boy as a surrogate mother and a lawyer that holds the viewer's interest on the main characters of the story. Although the film was formulaic, it still is worth the view for it has a good story to tell.

    I read the book "The Client" when I was about as old as the titular character. I remember being scandalized by the idea of kids my age smoking (I was a tad sheltered) and that was enough to get my interest. It took me two days to read the book, lazy days at my grandparent's summer home over the fourth of July. In fact, I was so hooked by the book I fought my family about going out to see the fireworks. I just couldn't step away! Grisham books are usually formulaic but well-constructed. The same can be said for this movie. The script is pretty good, although there is A LOT of expository dialog in the first twenty minutes or so. Nearly every scene either advances the plot by raising the stakes or works to flesh out the main players. The conclusion is somewhat contrived (as it was in the book) and everything gets wrapped up neatly in the end. However, it's still satisfying. The film is rife with clich&eacute;d situations and familiar archetypal characters, but the great performances by the entire cast generally make up for it. the greatest strength of the film are the protagonists played by Susan Sarandon and Brad Renfro. These characters are well-developed and expertly portrayed. Sarandon steals the show but young Renfro does an amazing job keeping up with her. he was such an underrated actor whose private life unfortunately overshadowed his huge talent in the eyes of many. He really had the potential to be a huge A-lister. Of course, Tommy Lee Jones is great and his interplay with Sarandon is a joy to watch. Although he is not exactly the "good guy", his character is easy to like. Probably the main issue (and it's likely so in the book as well, I can't remember)is that while the protagonists are well-developed and interesting, the villains come straight from central casting. I have to say, such well-developed heroes deserve more interesting enemies! Overall though, very nice and memorable thriller. The film is not the pinnacle of its genre but still quite excellent.

    I finally sat down to watch this. I'm not big into 'lawyer' movies, and this plot never made much sense, but it got three stars on the tivo, so I said "sure, why not". First off, to be clear, I never read the book, nor have I read any Grisham novels. I never got the plot. Kid somehow finds out 'important' information, but won't tell anyone. Sounds, um, reasonable, sure. He then races to find a lawyer (and he doesn't trust lawyers) in order not to say anything. And I'm still not sure what the lawyer did for him, except get his family out of Memphis (which the DA should have been doing immediately). I couldn't stand ANY of the characters! Mark Sway just swore a lot and didn't have a clue what he was doing (and some people call him the 'hero'!). Not sure what Reggie the lawyer was trying to protect the boy from, for she seemed far more concerned over the law then the bad guys. The Barry 'the Blade' character made me wonder whether he was some guy who was posing as a mob killer, and thought that's how they dressed and acted. For he seemed as far from realistic as one could get. The cop that finds Mark has got to be one of the worst cops in Memphis. Kid finds body, you think he's hiding something. So the obvious way to get him to talk? Of course, try to scare it out of him! It always works! The federal agents seemed to be about as inept as possible. The DA made me wonder why anyone would pay attention to him, let alone the media. The family is in the hospital under police watch, but there's a detective down the hall watching the room? How does that happen? Speaking of the media, how about the supposed newspaper reporter. Taking pictures of the kid in the hospital room? Really? And the newspaper not only gave out his name, but printed a big picture of him? Finally, this is all about 'finding the body of the senator', but they never explained WHY that was important. A body is just a body. Sure, it can show the senator is truly dead. But not once did we hear "If we can find the body, we're sure to find proof that the blade did this!". Let alone, why would they think they could find it? Had they ever found any of his other victims? And did those not help send him to jail? Oh, and I didn't even get to the part where they go to NO to find the body for some insane reason. Anyone who thinks this is even a good movie needs to watch some good movies. Watch the Shawshank Redemption, and then watch this, and you'll see what I mean.

    first off I want to say even for all the plot holes in this movie it is still an OK movie to watch. But I just could not find it as enjoyable as I could when the kid you have to root for is a snot nosed little brat you want to smack the crap out of yourself. Saying that though even for when this movie was made the outstanding mistakes made by the legal part of this movie is beyond me. First off you have a cop intimidating a child witness which makes no sense, second when Mark was first brought in to talk to the lawyers they never would have anyway interviewed him without his mother because any defense lawyer would then tear apart the kids statement as soon as he took the stand and have all evidence thrown out of court, thirdly this is all based on what the lawyer might have told the kid which considering there is no proof they could ever possibly know what was actually talked about in the car all, all mark had to say was the guy just talked about wanting to die and the FBI could never prove otherwise and everything would once again be thrown out, fourth and finally even if Mark admitted that the lawyer told him something the FBI couldn't do anything with it because it is hearsay and also it broke client confidentiality as soon as the lawyer told Mark so it in no way could have been used as evidence and any evidence gotten from it would become invalid and not usable in a court of law. Also at one point in the movie the FBI hears on a wire tap the guy they want pretty much admitting to the crime and to wanting to whack the kid which is more than enough evidence they need to arrest him. OK movie but just full of to many plot holes to make any real sense.

First off you have a cop intimidating a child witness which makes no sense, second when Mark was first brought in to talk to the lawyers they never would have anyway interviewed him without his mother because any defense lawyer would then tear apart the kids statement as soon as he took the stand and have all evidence thrown out of court, thirdly this is all based on what the lawyer might have told the kid which considering there is no proof they could ever possibly know what was actually talked about in the car all, all mark had to say was the guy just talked about wanting to die and the FBI could never prove otherwise and everything would once again be thrown out, fourth and finally even if Mark admitted that the lawyer told him something the FBI couldn't do anything with it because it is hearsay and also it broke client confidentiality as soon as the lawyer told Mark so it in no way could have been used as evidence and any evidence gotten from it would become invalid and not usable in a court of law. Also at one point in the movie the FBI hears on a wire tap the guy they want pretty much admitting to the crime and to wanting to whack the kid which is more than enough evidence they need to arrest him. OK movie but just full of to many plot holes to make any real sense.

    The Client is a good film with moments of extreme greatness especially for a courtroom thriller such as this. But there are also scenes where they should have been added into the editing room. The film was excellent in the beginning, slows to a crawl in the middle, and picks up in the end. If it stayed like the beginning, this film would have been flawless. After a 11-year-old kid and his brother witnessed a suicide, the kid hires an attorney to help protect him and his family from threatening mafia members and a stubborn Federal District attorney. The acting is very good in this film. Susan Sarandon seemed like she was born to play this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old. Overall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this film. I rate this film 8/10.

    Lots of overacting and horrible fake Southern accents. A bit of ridiculous stuff in an otherwise good movie. Why can't they find Southern people to play these parts? Why do they insist on using actors and actresses that probably have never been to the South? We don't talk that way down here. We just DON'T! Watching it threw me off. The only real diction and pronunciation was the black judge; he was great. Real. Watching Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones act Southern is painful. I have to go on because I'm supposed to write at least ten lines of content but we Southerners don't need to rattle on to make a point. The bottom line for Hollywood: hire Southern actors to play Southern-based roles!

    I remember this as a great movie by Sarandon (Dead Man Walking), who got an Oscar nomination out of her performance in a year of great movies, the best being, of course, Four Weddings and a Funeral. Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, JFK) was super as the Rev. Roy, and the lovely and talented Mary-Louise Parker ("Weeds", "Angels in America") was great as Mark's (Brad Renfro) mom. Anthony LaPaglia was just the embodiment of evil as Barry Muldano. The supporting cast reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood: J.T. Walsh, William H. Macy, Bradley Whitford, Anthony Edwards, Ossie Davis, and more.

    Ironically enough I saw a Perry Mason episode a few days earlier where a young kid around Brad Renfro's age comes to Raymond Burr seeking legal advice and got taken on as a client eventually. I wonder if John Grisham saw the episode and got the germ of an idea for a book. Renfro is a most wanted individual. He saw a lawyer from New Orleans kill himself and before he died he revealed where the missing body of a Louisiana State Senator was. It seems as though organized crime put a hit on him and the discovery of said body will cinch an indictment against Anthony LaPaglia the number one contract killer in the New Orleans mob. So US Attorney Tommy Lee Jones wants Renfro. LaPaglia wants to silence him. It's all way too overwhelming for Renfro's mother, some poor white trash woman played by Mary Louise Parker. And too overwhelming for Renfro who finds Susan Sarandon as an attorney who will guard his interests. Susan Sarandon got a Best Actress nomination for this film and on the strength of her scenes as a righteous attorney guarding Renfro's interests and her very tender scenes with Renfro earning his trust which was not easy. Sarandon hits all the right notes and every emotion from her in this film rings true to life. Brad Renfro was a complete unknown who was cast in the film because he was a local kid and he does come across as a real kid and very well. Half of Sarandon's nomination should have been credited to him. Sad indeed that he proved to be another young Hollywood tragedy. Down in the cast in a small part that he really makes count is Ossie Davis playing a judge who is trying to sort out everyone's rights in this situation. Davis was a great authority figure on the bench. John Grisham novels have such interesting characters they seem to be almost ready made for a screen adaption. The Client is no exception here, you will be engrossed in the story within seconds of starting to watch this film.

    This film is about a young boy who witnessed the suicide of a mafia lawyer. "The Client" tells the thrilling story about a young boy who has to deal with the horror of witnessing a death, the subsequent legal battle and persecution from the mafia. The story is very intense, it grips me and keeps me on edge throughout. I feel for the poor boy who has the misfortune to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I also want to highlight Reggie Love's selfless kindness to help Mark in the first place. She is a really kind person to help a kid who happens to enter an attorney's office, who might be dismissed as buffing. "The Client" is an intense and engaging drama. I enjoyed it a lot.

    A sterling cast headed by Oscar-nominated Susan Sarandon makes this slick thriller one of the better adaptations of a John Grisham bestseller,The Client.The film stars Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones and Brad Renfro together with Mary-Louise Parker,Anthony LaPaglia,Anthony Edwards and Ossie Davis.It was based on Grisham's bestselling novel about a street-wise kid, Mark Sway, sees the suicide of Jerome Clifford, a prominent Louisiana lawyer, whose current client is Barry 'The Blade' Muldano, a Mafia hit-man who killed Senator Boyd Boyette.It was written by Robert Getchell; together with Akiva Goldsman and it was directed by Joel Schumacher,both of whom worked in another Grisham adaptation, A Time To Kill. Mark Sway witnesses the suicide of a Mafia lawyer, who confesses that the Mob was behind the murder of a U.S. senator. Mark's brother is traumatized into a coma by the incident; gangster Barry Muldano is soon on Mark's trail, and in desperation, he arrives at the office of recovering alcoholic lawyer Reggie Love. With the Mob after them, and a ruthless federal attorney trying to force Mark to reveal what he knows, Love battles to guarantee the safety of her client and his family. The relationship between Reggie Love and Mark Sway is the center of the film, adding considerable character development to plot's routine elements. This legal thriller isn't a masterpiece of suspense but it has its moments and is capable of providing entertainment.Susan Sarandon, the emotional center of the narrative, received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for playing a recovered alcoholic lawyer who interacts with the boy as a surrogate mother and a lawyer that holds the viewer's interest on the main characters of the story. Although the film was formulaic, it still is worth the view for it has a good story to tell.
