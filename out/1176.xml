    Welcome to Sarajevo (1997)directed by Michael Winterbottom is an official selection in 1997 FESTIVAL DE CANNES and was also runner up for Golden Palm. Three days ago I knew nothing about Sarajevo, except I knew a little about "SARAJEVO FILM FESTIVAL. I had a lucid dream on August 1st 2013 that, "I am in the city of SARAJEVO, This dream was as clear as real life, I was able to observe the buildings, Monuments, Restaurants, Cafes, People everything. It was an amazing experience, and above all I was able to remember everything in the same vivid form when I woke up." I did Image search on Google to verify the images from my dreams and this is how I came to know about The Film "Welcome To Sarajevo" and than I managed to watch it. The Visuals in the film penetrated my feeling and my whole existence as a human. The Film is based on Bosnian War from 1992 to 1996, During this period Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was besieged by the Army of Republika Srpska. The film exactly doesn't discuss the cause of the Bosnian war, It is more a personal interpretation of ITN reporter Henderson, his cameraman Greg and producer Jane Carson who is reporting the war in SARAJEVO. But many sequences of mass killing & ethnic cleansing in the film which i think has been grabbed form the original news footage of brutality of Serb soldiers. When we see a war film, I think there is something more important than the plot, treatment, performance of the Actors or Visual effects etc. I feel that the lessons of the dark sides of time and history it is trying to deliver us must be taken very seriously. And we must not consider it as any other ordinary film we watch in our everyday life. The Bosnian war is the most recent page written in black letters in the history of Europe. And after watching "Welcome to Sarajevo" I was able to develop a personal point of view about the design of war in human Life. I am taking this film just as an example, But I am talking in general. As humans we think that we are divided and discriminated geographically, and in cast, religion, race and In Majority or minorities. But I think it's an illusion which has been created for us from ancient times to perceive the world in this way. So, that we should never unite. In reality the world is discriminated in three parts - 1. Who has access to all the resources in the world, and owns all the muscle power. 2. The middle class people, who serve the existence of the 1st category. 3.Who only relies on the kindness of the first two category, they don't even have access to basic resources food, cloth, shelter etc. Except the first category other two hold no power or authority. They are just like puppets. They are meant to live on the mercy of the government or the extremist and they have to die with the wish of the government and the extremist. And it is like that because we have no will and we have never been able to develop the will against the government or the extremist. The war is the most lucrative business for politicians and capitalist and The news and stories of war is the most sell-able and entertaining. And while sitting in a warm comfortable room who cares about causalities of war happens in the front line. What I am trying to say that we need to develop the resistance and strength against the will of the group of people who sponsor war and causalities. Else like SARAJEVO any city in the world could become next hellish city for a while. It is time to go against the patterns we have been following. It seems completely awkward to me that The priest bless the Weapons and Soldiers and the same priest ask the people to be generous and kind and compassionate. What a contradiction ?,Yes ! People should be kind and compassionate so, they should be killed easily. We must develop our knowledge and inner understanding, So that we can understand the intent of the people who try to control everything in the world. Being the follower of extremist belief or sect will only give birth to more stories of war & brutality. By referring to the climax of "Welcome to Sarajevo"with a "concert of peace" on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, Where Harun playing his cello to hundreds of Sarajevans. I appeal to pray for peace in the world. I recommend to include this film in the film study course by all the film schools in the world because of it's original treatment and honest storytelling. And Next time whenever you watch a war film, think deeply, and think about other side of it. Don't just get yourself entertained.

    Welcome to Sarajevo is the result of a good effort but it is just not gripping like similar movies such as The Year of Living Dangerously. First of all, Woody Harreslson has like a bit part. He isn't even part of any of the major plot movements. He actually stands out like a sore thumb as some dumb, drunk, slightly retarded journalist with absolutely no purpose staggering around in a war zone. Second of all, since the majority of the film centers around trying to get children out of Sarajevo, it probably would have been more fitting to call it "Goodbye Sarajevo." I remember watching the events unfold on the news when this crisis was actually happening, and I have to say I got a better understanding of the situation from that than from this film. Granted, this is a beautifully shot film and it's not the worst war movie ever made, but, oh, it could have been so much more if it actually even attempted to shed some light on the horrors of the siege beyond depicting corpses spilling cherry syrup out of their heads in the street. Very little is explained. Like for example, why and how did the "driver" get shot. Or what was up with that scene during which the reporter dude against better advise just follows some stranger who doesn't even speak English into a room only to get mugged as warned. I couldn't really follow it and therefore didn't really enjoy Welcoem to Sarajevo.

    I'm just writing this review to point one thing out, the true story of Michael Nicholson (whom this movie is based off) involves him adopting and rescuing a Serbian girl named Natasha, not a Bosnian (Muslim) girl named Emira. Plenty of Serbian's themselves died in the siege of Sarajevo as we made up over 1/3 of the cities population. I'm not sure what the motive was behind switching the girl's ethnicity but I can only suspect that it was motivated by Hollywood's desire to uncomplicate a complicated mess as well as pander to public consensus that Serbs were the aggressors and the 'bad' guys while Bosniaks (Muslims) were the victims, 'good' guys. As far as the artistic merits of the movie herself, I liked how she interwove real footage with fiction, blurring the distinction. I also found it refreshing that such a marginal topic was brought to the big studios even though no one really watched. In the end though, the movie was okay, maybe even good but not great. The acting was fairly flat and the character development was mostly two dimensional. When the movie finishes, you forget about it.

    The Bosnian War was one of the most brutal war in recent years, with hundred thousands people being killed, and Bosnians and Muslims were killed. It was a conflicted that showed the weakness of the UN, and took time for the West to get involved. Sarajevo itself became a war zone the centre because a no-mans land. Welcome to Sarajevo starts in the early days of the Bosnian war in 1992. Sarajevo is besieged by the Serbian forces and Bosnians are being rounded up to locked up or killed. An ITN reporter Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane) is assigned to cover the war-zone. Sarajevo is a place where snipers are hunting on the roof-tops and shooting people who dare cross the streets: including children and journalists. In the city Michael befriends Flynn (Woody Harrelson), a American journalist who has a seemingly uncaring attitude, but is really interested about the people. Michael ends up reporting about an orphanage and the children on the frontline. He becomes very involved with the story, reporting on it every night and start a campaign to get governments involves. When a Children's Charities is able to evacuate some children and babies to relatives abroad and in Italy Michael becomes involved. He ends up taking a care of one nine year old girl, Emira (Emira Nusevic), who ends up living with his family based in London. This film is based on a true story, with some names and events changed to moral and dramatic reasons. But the issues of the film is the same. Michael Henderson was bit like Oscar Schlinder, an ordinary person thrown into a extraordinary circumstances. But the twist is as a journalist he was not meant to get too involved, but he broke that golden rule of journalism. It is a film about the ethics of journalism and when someone should get involved with the issues there are reporting. The film is also about the war, and random killings that happened in the conflict. Civilians were hurt and killed and non-Serbs were rounded up. Serbia has always seen itself as a nation that had a right in nations like Bosnia and Crotia, and wanting to ensure power for the Serbian minorities. Serbia has often been a power broker in the region since World War I. Sarajevo itself was a shell of a city, with it being a live and death struggle. Electricity cuts are normal, and water supplies are short. But some people still try and make a go of it in the city until the fighting increases. The film is also about the inaction of the UN. They were late getting involved, and even the troops there didn't do much at first. The West were reluctant to get involving, fearing that it would be a propaganda coup for the Serbs. This was not a good time for Western nations and the UN at this point in history. The acting in this film was excellent, as expected. No one let the film down. They was a fine tort script, preventing the film getting bogged down, and find direction by Michael Winterbottom. They are some shocking and surprise moments, giving the film a more edgy film, and the use of hand-held cameras added to the realist feel. There are some continuous shots which I live and good editing. The use of news footage was also fitting and well done, giving the audience some background information and showing the wider affects of the war with the international community. However, I think some of Winterbottom's music choices were ill-fitting. He used some classic pop song which felt out of context. It does sometimes work, like in Vietnam war film, but that is normally to show the sixties setting and because the films have a longer timeline. However, this is a worthy film about an important war. If you like this then I also recommend Hotel Rwanda and Shooting Dogs are essential viewing.

    This movie brought home to me the scope of the violent chaos in Bosnia, which I had pretty much ignored as a news story. It did not tell me who the various factions were. I learned little of the causes. But it brought into specific relief the horrors of this war and all those like it. When the movie finally settles down and we are familiar with the characters, then the story becomes personalized in one reporter's quest to save one little girl. And it is here that the movie shines. Stephen Dillane is good as the British reporter, trying to make a difference, even at the loss of his journalistic distance and impartiality. Woody Harrelson is spot-on as the wild American journalist. And little Emira Nusevic is excellent as the child in question. Marisa Tomei is very good in the tiny part of a relief worker. It is to her credit that she eschews any semblance of Hollywood glamor and handles his gritty little role perfectly. Why not 10 stars? Well, the first third of the picture is devoted to establishing the chaos and horrors of war, and in doing so leaves the viewer somewhat asea as to what is going on and who the players are, in terms of their relevance to the ultimate story. I think it is a 'must see'.

    6.9 votes equal to fragile. And 'now clear that this site has a strong antipathy towards the horror film. If this movie had been in Stephen King would have had more. For me to go to pieces is the comment by Aaron1375. AARON STILL TU, quache distant relative of SHARON? Restless character already seen previously. Why make comparisons between SILENT HILL AND MIRRORS? E '100 times better this movie. Silent hill comes from a video. Do you have anything like the original film plot. There are mediocre film recited by actors who have high ratings as we are beautiful film recited by people less known. This site is so. In this movie there is a coup scene that leaves us with mouth open the others kind of Nicole Kidman. But since this movie and played by Sutherland takes one vote less. that's disgusting. Arise THE VOTE!

    Just to point out something, that previous comment that said that Muslims weren't the victims in this war, just to tell you, how can anyone know who was the victim and who wasn't? My father lost all of his family in this war, his younger sister was shot right in front of him. His mother died a painful death, today my father has no one to call and check on to, why? because NOT all, but most Serbs who fought the war didn't give a rat's ass if you were a Muslim child, youngster, or if you needed a cane to walk with, all they wanted is murder and believe me i had to witness all of that myself. To generally speak about this movie, i watched it just right now as we speak, and the movie qualifies to show you some of the brutal slaughters that happened during those tragical unbelievable years. You can ask any Bosnian Muslim about the war, and they won't talk about it. My best friend's older brother was 9 years old when he saw Serbian soldiers take his father to his own backyard, torturing him, and killing him in front of his very own child, and then people dare to say that the Serbs were the victims? still this day, my friend's brother has effects from that day, you look at his face and you know that there is something wrong. This isn't basically a movie review, this is MY side of the story on how it happened and on how no one seemed to care about hundreds of children dying each day because some stupid nonsense pricks decided to kill everyone just to have their own F'n independence, well all i can say is i take big Sh.. on your independence. This movie brought my friends to tears, those who don't know 1% about the war, and surely it will bring those who actually lived it. I voted it a 10 just because i am actually glad they show the real side of the war, and how WE were the F'n victims. Hate this comment or love it, i don't care, but at least i shared the truth of my opinion, and the truth of our war.

    This film is about a group of journalist covering the news of the war in Sarajevo. They have decided to take the matter into their own hands as the West fails to do anything about it. "Welcome to Sarajevo" is a striking, engaging and saddening drama. It is raw, brutal, and it evokes so much emotions in me. The usage of real documentary footage in the film enhances the realism and shock effect of the film. Indeed, it is hard to watch all the dead bodies on the roadside. And the United Nations spokesman saying there are thirteen places worse than Sarajevo provokes so much anger in me. The bureaucracy is scandalous and heinous. It is so hard to see lives lost, dreams shattered and cities destroyed. One of Flynn's lines about if the attacking side was reversed may well be right. Apart from raising awareness, sympathy, despair and anger, "Welcome to Sarajevo" also looks at ethical issues of who is to decide what is right for the people. "Welcome to Sarajevo" is engaging and well made. It deserves more attention than it is getting.

    The movie was depressing. Thats because it told the war like it is. Its true that both sides suffered in the war, but one side suffered a cut while the other side was cut in half. I liked how the movie depicted the situation as it was, and illustrated the media as a corporate entity trying to make money and advance themselves to the "first page" of the paper as opposed to something overly sympathetic. Bottom line, it was believable. My knock against the movie was the ending. I suppose the directors left the ending open and up in the air, just like the war. You think you have an idea of what may happen, but you really have no idea at all. So it was symbolic, but the whole movie didn't follow this theme, rather it was a story, and naturally you want to see how it ends.

    With the two sides in the Bosnian war producing significant civilian casualties a third force enters the conflict zone. Armed with cameras and microphones, they are the eyes and ears of the West through the daily news. Among them is serious British journalist Michael Henderson and the more flamboyant American Flynn. While the latter is concerned with his ratings and manages to stay relaxed with all the violence around him, the former becomes tied up with the plight of the children in an orphanage on the front line and loses his distance from the story as he tries to force someone, anyone, to get the children out of the war zone. The film opens with a scene that sums the evil nature of the Bosnia conflict up perfectly when one of a wedding party is picked off by a sniper. It is an impacting way to open a film and the script more or less maintains this across the film in one way or another. The plot is hardly anything too original as mostly it relies on Henderson getting personally involved in his story to provide a narrative frame for the conflict but the film uses it well. Winterbottom was a good choice for director because he doesn't over-egg the emotion or push the narrative beyond what it can cope with. Instead he uses it well to tell one story without ever losing sight of the fact that it is just one story among millions. This worked well for me as I found the bigger picture to be the more engaging side of the film but appreciated the structure given the subject by the narrative; this way it remains impacting on a political level while also looking at the personal, human level. With the time the relevance of the film will fade as the conflict becomes something in the past  I don't mean this coldly but just suggest that something fresh in our collective memories will be of more relevant than something in the "past". The film retains its impact because it does shown more than the news showed but what I found more distressing was the fact that the same attacks on the media and our politicians could be launched about many conflicts since. Welcome to Dafour, Rwanda, Iraq  take your pick. How many times do we see our "leaders" quibble over the legal definition of genocide while the news footage shows us images of corpses and the suffering of civilians? Winterbottom uses news footage within his material to good effect to highlight the stupidity and hypocrisy of the world leaders in the face of such horror and few viewers will take too much issue with the lack of balance in this regard; it is a strength of the film that these points are still valid but I truly wish that they weren't. The cast take to this serious material well and produce some solid performances while also knowing their place within the bigger picture and not showboating or overdoing things. Dillane is the best example of this as he is technically the lead character but yet holds back and shows restraint to the point of keeping his story from dominating the film  it is a good show and Winterbottom also deserves credit for helping him produce this. Looking at it cynically, Harrelson and Tomei were added to sell the film and this is mostly what they do; however both are solid albeit in smaller roles than some viewers will expect. Nesbitt, Fox, Visnjic and Nusevic all produce solid support and more than stand up alongside Dillane's lead. The most important delivery is that of the conflict itself and Winterbottom does that well. Some viewers have bemoaned the lack of context or explanation of the conflict but to me this was a good call because what matters is that civilians were slaughtered and suffering, when this is the case what does it matter what the reasons for it are? Overall then a solid and impacting film. It doesn't have the most balance in the world but it is well worth a watch for what it does well and, sadly, the continuing relevance in current conflicts around the world today.

    I'm just writing this review to point one thing out, the true story of Michael Nicholson (whom this movie is based off) involves him adopting and rescuing a Serbian girl named Natasha, not a Bosnian (Muslim) girl named Emira. Plenty of Serbian's themselves died in the siege of Sarajevo as we made up over 1/3 of the cities population. I'm not sure what the motive was behind switching the girl's ethnicity but I can only suspect that it was motivated by Hollywood's desire to uncomplicate a complicated mess as well as pander to public consensus that Serbs were the aggressors and the 'bad' guys while Bosniaks (Muslims) were the victims, 'good' guys.

The acting was fairly flat and the character development was mostly two dimensional. When the movie finishes, you forget about it.

    The Bosnian War was one of the most brutal war in recent years, with hundred thousands people being killed, and Bosnians and Muslims were killed. It was a conflicted that showed the weakness of the UN, and took time for the West to get involved. Sarajevo itself became a war zone the centre because a no-mans land. Welcome to Sarajevo starts in the early days of the Bosnian war in 1992. Sarajevo is besieged by the Serbian forces and Bosnians are being rounded up to locked up or killed. An ITN reporter Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane) is assigned to cover the war-zone. Sarajevo is a place where snipers are hunting on the roof-tops and shooting people who dare cross the streets: including children and journalists. In the city Michael befriends Flynn (Woody Harrelson), a American journalist who has a seemingly uncaring attitude, but is really interested about the people. Michael ends up reporting about an orphanage and the children on the frontline. He becomes very involved with the story, reporting on it every night and start a campaign to get governments involves. When a Children's Charities is able to evacuate some children and babies to relatives abroad and in Italy Michael becomes involved. He ends up taking a care of one nine year old girl, Emira (Emira Nusevic), who ends up living with his family based in London. This film is based on a true story, with some names and events changed to moral and dramatic reasons. But the issues of the film is the same. Michael Henderson was bit like Oscar Schlinder, an ordinary person thrown into a extraordinary circumstances. But the twist is as a journalist he was not meant to get too involved, but he broke that golden rule of journalism. It is a film about the ethics of journalism and when someone should get involved with the issues there are reporting. The film is also about the war, and random killings that happened in the conflict. Civilians were hurt and killed and non-Serbs were rounded up. Serbia has always seen itself as a nation that had a right in nations like Bosnia and Crotia, and wanting to ensure power for the Serbian minorities. Serbia has often been a power broker in the region since World War I. Sarajevo itself was a shell of a city, with it being a live and death struggle. Electricity cuts are normal, and water supplies are short. But some people still try and make a go of it in the city until the fighting increases. The film is also about the inaction of the UN. They were late getting involved, and even the troops there didn't do much at first. The West were reluctant to get involving, fearing that it would be a propaganda coup for the Serbs. This was not a good time for Western nations and the UN at this point in history. The acting in this film was excellent, as expected. No one let the film down. They was a fine tort script, preventing the film getting bogged down, and find direction by Michael Winterbottom. They are some shocking and surprise moments, giving the film a more edgy film, and the use of hand-held cameras added to the realist feel. There are some continuous shots which I live and good editing. The use of news footage was also fitting and well done, giving the audience some background information and showing the wider affects of the war with the international community. However, I think some of Winterbottom's music choices were ill-fitting. He used some classic pop song which felt out of context. It does sometimes work, like in Vietnam war film, but that is normally to show the sixties setting and because the films have a longer timeline. However, this is a worthy film about an important war. If you like this then I also recommend Hotel Rwanda and Shooting Dogs are essential viewing.

    This movie brought home to me the scope of the violent chaos in Bosnia, which I had pretty much ignored as a news story. It did not tell me who the various factions were. I learned little of the causes. But it brought into specific relief the horrors of this war and all those like it. When the movie finally settles down and we are familiar with the characters, then the story becomes personalized in one reporter's quest to save one little girl. And it is here that the movie shines. Stephen Dillane is good as the British reporter, trying to make a difference, even at the loss of his journalistic distance and impartiality. Woody Harrelson is spot-on as the wild American journalist. And little Emira Nusevic is excellent as the child in question. Marisa Tomei is very good in the tiny part of a relief worker. It is to her credit that she eschews any semblance of Hollywood glamor and handles his gritty little role perfectly. Why not 10 stars? Well, the first third of the picture is devoted to establishing the chaos and horrors of war, and in doing so leaves the viewer somewhat asea as to what is going on and who the players are, in terms of their relevance to the ultimate story. I think it is a 'must see'.

    Just to point out something, that previous comment that said that Muslims weren't the victims in this war, just to tell you, how can anyone know who was the victim and who wasn't? My father lost all of his family in this war, his younger sister was shot right in front of him. His mother died a painful death, today my father has no one to call and check on to, why? because NOT all, but most Serbs who fought the war didn't give a rat's ass if you were a Muslim child, youngster, or if you needed a cane to walk with, all they wanted is murder and believe me i had to witness all of that myself. To generally speak about this movie, i watched it just right now as we speak, and the movie qualifies to show you some of the brutal slaughters that happened during those tragical unbelievable years. You can ask any Bosnian Muslim about the war, and they won't talk about it. My best friend's older brother was 9 years old when he saw Serbian soldiers take his father to his own backyard, torturing him, and killing him in front of his very own child, and then people dare to say that the Serbs were the victims? still this day, my friend's brother has effects from that day, you look at his face and you know that there is something wrong. This isn't basically a movie review, this is MY side of the story on how it happened and on how no one seemed to care about hundreds of children dying each day because some stupid nonsense pricks decided to kill everyone just to have their own F'n independence, well all i can say is i take big Sh.. on your independence. This movie brought my friends to tears, those who don't know 1% about the war, and surely it will bring those who actually lived it. I voted it a 10 just because i am actually glad they show the real side of the war, and how WE were the F'n victims. Hate this comment or love it, i don't care, but at least i shared the truth of my opinion, and the truth of our war.

    This film is about a group of journalist covering the news of the war in Sarajevo. They have decided to take the matter into their own hands as the West fails to do anything about it. "Welcome to Sarajevo" is a striking, engaging and saddening drama. It is raw, brutal, and it evokes so much emotions in me. The usage of real documentary footage in the film enhances the realism and shock effect of the film. Indeed, it is hard to watch all the dead bodies on the roadside. And the United Nations spokesman saying there are thirteen places worse than Sarajevo provokes so much anger in me. The bureaucracy is scandalous and heinous. It is so hard to see lives lost, dreams shattered and cities destroyed. One of Flynn's lines about if the attacking side was reversed may well be right. Apart from raising awareness, sympathy, despair and anger, "Welcome to Sarajevo" also looks at ethical issues of who is to decide what is right for the people. "Welcome to Sarajevo" is engaging and well made. It deserves more attention than it is getting.

    The movie was depressing. Thats because it told the war like it is. Its true that both sides suffered in the war, but one side suffered a cut while the other side was cut in half. I liked how the movie depicted the situation as it was, and illustrated the media as a corporate entity trying to make money and advance themselves to the "first page" of the paper as opposed to something overly sympathetic. Bottom line, it was believable. My knock against the movie was the ending. I suppose the directors left the ending open and up in the air, just like the war. You think you have an idea of what may happen, but you really have no idea at all. So it was symbolic, but the whole movie didn't follow this theme, rather it was a story, and naturally you want to see how it ends.

    With the two sides in the Bosnian war producing significant civilian casualties a third force enters the conflict zone. Armed with cameras and microphones, they are the eyes and ears of the West through the daily news. Among them is serious British journalist Michael Henderson and the more flamboyant American Flynn. While the latter is concerned with his ratings and manages to stay relaxed with all the violence around him, the former becomes tied up with the plight of the children in an orphanage on the front line and loses his distance from the story as he tries to force someone, anyone, to get the children out of the war zone. The film opens with a scene that sums the evil nature of the Bosnia conflict up perfectly when one of a wedding party is picked off by a sniper. It is an impacting way to open a film and the script more or less maintains this across the film in one way or another. The plot is hardly anything too original as mostly it relies on Henderson getting personally involved in his story to provide a narrative frame for the conflict but the film uses it well. Winterbottom was a good choice for director because he doesn't over-egg the emotion or push the narrative beyond what it can cope with. Instead he uses it well to tell one story without ever losing sight of the fact that it is just one story among millions. This worked well for me as I found the bigger picture to be the more engaging side of the film but appreciated the structure given the subject by the narrative; this way it remains impacting on a political level while also looking at the personal, human level. With the time the relevance of the film will fade as the conflict becomes something in the past  I don't mean this coldly but just suggest that something fresh in our collective memories will be of more relevant than something in the "past". The film retains its impact because it does shown more than the news showed but what I found more distressing was the fact that the same attacks on the media and our politicians could be launched about many conflicts since. Welcome to Dafour, Rwanda, Iraq  take your pick. How many times do we see our "leaders" quibble over the legal definition of genocide while the news footage shows us images of corpses and the suffering of civilians? Winterbottom uses news footage within his material to good effect to highlight the stupidity and hypocrisy of the world leaders in the face of such horror and few viewers will take too much issue with the lack of balance in this regard; it is a strength of the film that these points are still valid but I truly wish that they weren't. The cast take to this serious material well and produce some solid performances while also knowing their place within the bigger picture and not showboating or overdoing things. Dillane is the best example of this as he is technically the lead character but yet holds back and shows restraint to the point of keeping his story from dominating the film  it is a good show and Winterbottom also deserves credit for helping him produce this. Looking at it cynically, Harrelson and Tomei were added to sell the film and this is mostly what they do; however both are solid albeit in smaller roles than some viewers will expect. Nesbitt, Fox, Visnjic and Nusevic all produce solid support and more than stand up alongside Dillane's lead. The most important delivery is that of the conflict itself and Winterbottom does that well. Some viewers have bemoaned the lack of context or explanation of the conflict but to me this was a good call because what matters is that civilians were slaughtered and suffering, when this is the case what does it matter what the reasons for it are? Overall then a solid and impacting film. It doesn't have the most balance in the world but it is well worth a watch for what it does well and, sadly, the continuing relevance in current conflicts around the world today.

    Welcome to Sarajevo (1997)directed by Michael Winterbottom is an official selection in 1997 FESTIVAL DE CANNES and was also runner up for Golden Palm. Three days ago I knew nothing about Sarajevo, except I knew a little about "SARAJEVO FILM FESTIVAL. I had a lucid dream on August 1st 2013 that, "I am in the city of SARAJEVO, This dream was as clear as real life, I was able to observe the buildings, Monuments, Restaurants, Cafes, People everything. It was an amazing experience, and above all I was able to remember everything in the same vivid form when I woke up." I did Image search on Google to verify the images from my dreams and this is how I came to know about The Film "Welcome To Sarajevo" and than I managed to watch it. The Visuals in the film penetrated my feeling and my whole existence as a human. The Film is based on Bosnian War from 1992 to 1996, During this period Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was besieged by the Army of Republika Srpska. The film exactly doesn't discuss the cause of the Bosnian war, It is more a personal interpretation of ITN reporter Henderson, his cameraman Greg and producer Jane Carson who is reporting the war in SARAJEVO. But many sequences of mass killing & ethnic cleansing in the film which i think has been grabbed form the original news footage of brutality of Serb soldiers. When we see a war film, I think there is something more important than the plot, treatment, performance of the Actors or Visual effects etc. I feel that the lessons of the dark sides of time and history it is trying to deliver us must be taken very seriously. And we must not consider it as any other ordinary film we watch in our everyday life. The Bosnian war is the most recent page written in black letters in the history of Europe. And after watching "Welcome to Sarajevo" I was able to develop a personal point of view about the design of war in human Life. I am taking this film just as an example, But I am talking in general. As humans we think that we are divided and discriminated geographically, and in cast, religion, race and In Majority or minorities. But I think it's an illusion which has been created for us from ancient times to perceive the world in this way. So, that we should never unite. In reality the world is discriminated in three parts - 1. Who has access to all the resources in the world, and owns all the muscle power. 2. The middle class people, who serve the existence of the 1st category. 3.Who only relies on the kindness of the first two category, they don't even have access to basic resources food, cloth, shelter etc. Except the first category other two hold no power or authority. They are just like puppets. They are meant to live on the mercy of the government or the extremist and they have to die with the wish of the government and the extremist. And it is like that because we have no will and we have never been able to develop the will against the government or the extremist. The war is the most lucrative business for politicians and capitalist and The news and stories of war is the most sell-able and entertaining. And while sitting in a warm comfortable room who cares about causalities of war happens in the front line. What I am trying to say that we need to develop the resistance and strength against the will of the group of people who sponsor war and causalities. Else like SARAJEVO any city in the world could become next hellish city for a while. It is time to go against the patterns we have been following. It seems completely awkward to me that The priest bless the Weapons and Soldiers and the same priest ask the people to be generous and kind and compassionate. What a contradiction ?,Yes ! People should be kind and compassionate so, they should be killed easily. We must develop our knowledge and inner understanding, So that we can understand the intent of the people who try to control everything in the world. Being the follower of extremist belief or sect will only give birth to more stories of war & brutality. By referring to the climax of "Welcome to Sarajevo"with a "concert of peace" on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, Where Harun playing his cello to hundreds of Sarajevans. I appeal to pray for peace in the world. I recommend to include this film in the film study course by all the film schools in the world because of it's original treatment and honest storytelling. And Next time whenever you watch a war film, think deeply, and think about other side of it. Don't just get yourself entertained.

    Welcome to Sarajevo is the result of a good effort but it is just not gripping like similar movies such as The Year of Living Dangerously. First of all, Woody Harreslson has like a bit part. He isn't even part of any of the major plot movements. He actually stands out like a sore thumb as some dumb, drunk, slightly retarded journalist with absolutely no purpose staggering around in a war zone. Second of all, since the majority of the film centers around trying to get children out of Sarajevo, it probably would have been more fitting to call it "Goodbye Sarajevo." I remember watching the events unfold on the news when this crisis was actually happening, and I have to say I got a better understanding of the situation from that than from this film. Granted, this is a beautifully shot film and it's not the worst war movie ever made, but, oh, it could have been so much more if it actually even attempted to shed some light on the horrors of the siege beyond depicting corpses spilling cherry syrup out of their heads in the street. Very little is explained. Like for example, why and how did the "driver" get shot. Or what was up with that scene during which the reporter dude against better advise just follows some stranger who doesn't even speak English into a room only to get mugged as warned. I couldn't really follow it and therefore didn't really enjoy Welcoem to Sarajevo.

    I'm just writing this review to point one thing out, the true story of Michael Nicholson (whom this movie is based off) involves him adopting and rescuing a Serbian girl named Natasha, not a Bosnian (Muslim) girl named Emira. Plenty of Serbian's themselves died in the siege of Sarajevo as we made up over 1/3 of the cities population. I'm not sure what the motive was behind switching the girl's ethnicity but I can only suspect that it was motivated by Hollywood's desire to uncomplicate a complicated mess as well as pander to public consensus that Serbs were the aggressors and the 'bad' guys while Bosniaks (Muslims) were the victims, 'good' guys. As far as the artistic merits of the movie herself, I liked how she interwove real footage with fiction, blurring the distinction. I also found it refreshing that such a marginal topic was brought to the big studios even though no one really watched. In the end though, the movie was okay, maybe even good but not great. The acting was fairly flat and the character development was mostly two dimensional. When the movie finishes, you forget about it.

"Welcome to Sarajevo" is a striking, engaging and saddening drama. It is raw, brutal, and it evokes so much emotions in me. The usage of real documentary footage in the film enhances the realism and shock effect of the film. Indeed, it is hard to watch all the dead bodies on the roadside. And the United Nations spokesman saying there are thirteen places worse than Sarajevo provokes so much anger in me. The bureaucracy is scandalous and heinous. It is so hard to see lives lost, dreams shattered and cities destroyed. One of Flynn's lines about if the attacking side was reversed may well be right. Apart from raising awareness, sympathy, despair and anger, "Welcome to Sarajevo" also looks at ethical issues of who is to decide what is right for the people. "Welcome to Sarajevo" is engaging and well made. It deserves more attention than it is getting.

    The movie was depressing. Thats because it told the war like it is. Its true that both sides suffered in the war, but one side suffered a cut while the other side was cut in half. I liked how the movie depicted the situation as it was, and illustrated the media as a corporate entity trying to make money and advance themselves to the "first page" of the paper as opposed to something overly sympathetic. Bottom line, it was believable. My knock against the movie was the ending. I suppose the directors left the ending open and up in the air, just like the war. You think you have an idea of what may happen, but you really have no idea at all. So it was symbolic, but the whole movie didn't follow this theme, rather it was a story, and naturally you want to see how it ends.

    With the two sides in the Bosnian war producing significant civilian casualties a third force enters the conflict zone. Armed with cameras and microphones, they are the eyes and ears of the West through the daily news. Among them is serious British journalist Michael Henderson and the more flamboyant American Flynn. While the latter is concerned with his ratings and manages to stay relaxed with all the violence around him, the former becomes tied up with the plight of the children in an orphanage on the front line and loses his distance from the story as he tries to force someone, anyone, to get the children out of the war zone. The film opens with a scene that sums the evil nature of the Bosnia conflict up perfectly when one of a wedding party is picked off by a sniper. It is an impacting way to open a film and the script more or less maintains this across the film in one way or another. The plot is hardly anything too original as mostly it relies on Henderson getting personally involved in his story to provide a narrative frame for the conflict but the film uses it well. Winterbottom was a good choice for director because he doesn't over-egg the emotion or push the narrative beyond what it can cope with. Instead he uses it well to tell one story without ever losing sight of the fact that it is just one story among millions. This worked well for me as I found the bigger picture to be the more engaging side of the film but appreciated the structure given the subject by the narrative; this way it remains impacting on a political level while also looking at the personal, human level. With the time the relevance of the film will fade as the conflict becomes something in the past  I don't mean this coldly but just suggest that something fresh in our collective memories will be of more relevant than something in the "past". The film retains its impact because it does shown more than the news showed but what I found more distressing was the fact that the same attacks on the media and our politicians could be launched about many conflicts since. Welcome to Dafour, Rwanda, Iraq  take your pick. How many times do we see our "leaders" quibble over the legal definition of genocide while the news footage shows us images of corpses and the suffering of civilians? Winterbottom uses news footage within his material to good effect to highlight the stupidity and hypocrisy of the world leaders in the face of such horror and few viewers will take too much issue with the lack of balance in this regard; it is a strength of the film that these points are still valid but I truly wish that they weren't. The cast take to this serious material well and produce some solid performances while also knowing their place within the bigger picture and not showboating or overdoing things. Dillane is the best example of this as he is technically the lead character but yet holds back and shows restraint to the point of keeping his story from dominating the film  it is a good show and Winterbottom also deserves credit for helping him produce this. Looking at it cynically, Harrelson and Tomei were added to sell the film and this is mostly what they do; however both are solid albeit in smaller roles than some viewers will expect. Nesbitt, Fox, Visnjic and Nusevic all produce solid support and more than stand up alongside Dillane's lead. The most important delivery is that of the conflict itself and Winterbottom does that well. Some viewers have bemoaned the lack of context or explanation of the conflict but to me this was a good call because what matters is that civilians were slaughtered and suffering, when this is the case what does it matter what the reasons for it are? Overall then a solid and impacting film. It doesn't have the most balance in the world but it is well worth a watch for what it does well and, sadly, the continuing relevance in current conflicts around the world today.

    Welcome to Sarajevo (1997)directed by Michael Winterbottom is an official selection in 1997 FESTIVAL DE CANNES and was also runner up for Golden Palm. Three days ago I knew nothing about Sarajevo, except I knew a little about "SARAJEVO FILM FESTIVAL. I had a lucid dream on August 1st 2013 that, "I am in the city of SARAJEVO, This dream was as clear as real life, I was able to observe the buildings, Monuments, Restaurants, Cafes, People everything. It was an amazing experience, and above all I was able to remember everything in the same vivid form when I woke up." I did Image search on Google to verify the images from my dreams and this is how I came to know about The Film "Welcome To Sarajevo" and than I managed to watch it. The Visuals in the film penetrated my feeling and my whole existence as a human. The Film is based on Bosnian War from 1992 to 1996, During this period Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was besieged by the Army of Republika Srpska. The film exactly doesn't discuss the cause of the Bosnian war, It is more a personal interpretation of ITN reporter Henderson, his cameraman Greg and producer Jane Carson who is reporting the war in SARAJEVO. But many sequences of mass killing & ethnic cleansing in the film which i think has been grabbed form the original news footage of brutality of Serb soldiers. When we see a war film, I think there is something more important than the plot, treatment, performance of the Actors or Visual effects etc. I feel that the lessons of the dark sides of time and history it is trying to deliver us must be taken very seriously. And we must not consider it as any other ordinary film we watch in our everyday life. The Bosnian war is the most recent page written in black letters in the history of Europe. And after watching "Welcome to Sarajevo" I was able to develop a personal point of view about the design of war in human Life. I am taking this film just as an example, But I am talking in general. As humans we think that we are divided and discriminated geographically, and in cast, religion, race and In Majority or minorities. But I think it's an illusion which has been created for us from ancient times to perceive the world in this way. So, that we should never unite. In reality the world is discriminated in three parts - 1. Who has access to all the resources in the world, and owns all the muscle power. 2. The middle class people, who serve the existence of the 1st category. 3.Who only relies on the kindness of the first two category, they don't even have access to basic resources food, cloth, shelter etc. Except the first category other two hold no power or authority. They are just like puppets. They are meant to live on the mercy of the government or the extremist and they have to die with the wish of the government and the extremist. And it is like that because we have no will and we have never been able to develop the will against the government or the extremist. The war is the most lucrative business for politicians and capitalist and The news and stories of war is the most sell-able and entertaining. And while sitting in a warm comfortable room who cares about causalities of war happens in the front line. What I am trying to say that we need to develop the resistance and strength against the will of the group of people who sponsor war and causalities. Else like SARAJEVO any city in the world could become next hellish city for a while. It is time to go against the patterns we have been following. It seems completely awkward to me that The priest bless the Weapons and Soldiers and the same priest ask the people to be generous and kind and compassionate. What a contradiction ?,Yes ! People should be kind and compassionate so, they should be killed easily. We must develop our knowledge and inner understanding, So that we can understand the intent of the people who try to control everything in the world. Being the follower of extremist belief or sect will only give birth to more stories of war & brutality. By referring to the climax of "Welcome to Sarajevo"with a "concert of peace" on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, Where Harun playing his cello to hundreds of Sarajevans. I appeal to pray for peace in the world. I recommend to include this film in the film study course by all the film schools in the world because of it's original treatment and honest storytelling. And Next time whenever you watch a war film, think deeply, and think about other side of it. Don't just get yourself entertained.

    Welcome to Sarajevo is the result of a good effort but it is just not gripping like similar movies such as The Year of Living Dangerously. First of all, Woody Harreslson has like a bit part. He isn't even part of any of the major plot movements. He actually stands out like a sore thumb as some dumb, drunk, slightly retarded journalist with absolutely no purpose staggering around in a war zone. Second of all, since the majority of the film centers around trying to get children out of Sarajevo, it probably would have been more fitting to call it "Goodbye Sarajevo." I remember watching the events unfold on the news when this crisis was actually happening, and I have to say I got a better understanding of the situation from that than from this film. Granted, this is a beautifully shot film and it's not the worst war movie ever made, but, oh, it could have been so much more if it actually even attempted to shed some light on the horrors of the siege beyond depicting corpses spilling cherry syrup out of their heads in the street. Very little is explained. Like for example, why and how did the "driver" get shot. Or what was up with that scene during which the reporter dude against better advise just follows some stranger who doesn't even speak English into a room only to get mugged as warned. I couldn't really follow it and therefore didn't really enjoy Welcoem to Sarajevo.

    I'm just writing this review to point one thing out, the true story of Michael Nicholson (whom this movie is based off) involves him adopting and rescuing a Serbian girl named Natasha, not a Bosnian (Muslim) girl named Emira. Plenty of Serbian's themselves died in the siege of Sarajevo as we made up over 1/3 of the cities population. I'm not sure what the motive was behind switching the girl's ethnicity but I can only suspect that it was motivated by Hollywood's desire to uncomplicate a complicated mess as well as pander to public consensus that Serbs were the aggressors and the 'bad' guys while Bosniaks (Muslims) were the victims, 'good' guys. As far as the artistic merits of the movie herself, I liked how she interwove real footage with fiction, blurring the distinction. I also found it refreshing that such a marginal topic was brought to the big studios even though no one really watched. In the end though, the movie was okay, maybe even good but not great. The acting was fairly flat and the character development was mostly two dimensional. When the movie finishes, you forget about it.

    The Bosnian War was one of the most brutal war in recent years, with hundred thousands people being killed, and Bosnians and Muslims were killed. It was a conflicted that showed the weakness of the UN, and took time for the West to get involved. Sarajevo itself became a war zone the centre because a no-mans land. Welcome to Sarajevo starts in the early days of the Bosnian war in 1992. Sarajevo is besieged by the Serbian forces and Bosnians are being rounded up to locked up or killed. An ITN reporter Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane) is assigned to cover the war-zone. Sarajevo is a place where snipers are hunting on the roof-tops and shooting people who dare cross the streets: including children and journalists. In the city Michael befriends Flynn (Woody Harrelson), a American journalist who has a seemingly uncaring attitude, but is really interested about the people. Michael ends up reporting about an orphanage and the children on the frontline. He becomes very involved with the story, reporting on it every night and start a campaign to get governments involves. When a Children's Charities is able to evacuate some children and babies to relatives abroad and in Italy Michael becomes involved. He ends up taking a care of one nine year old girl, Emira (Emira Nusevic), who ends up living with his family based in London. This film is based on a true story, with some names and events changed to moral and dramatic reasons. But the issues of the film is the same. Michael Henderson was bit like Oscar Schlinder, an ordinary person thrown into a extraordinary circumstances. But the twist is as a journalist he was not meant to get too involved, but he broke that golden rule of journalism. It is a film about the ethics of journalism and when someone should get involved with the issues there are reporting. The film is also about the war, and random killings that happened in the conflict. Civilians were hurt and killed and non-Serbs were rounded up. Serbia has always seen itself as a nation that had a right in nations like Bosnia and Crotia, and wanting to ensure power for the Serbian minorities. Serbia has often been a power broker in the region since World War I. Sarajevo itself was a shell of a city, with it being a live and death struggle. Electricity cuts are normal, and water supplies are short. But some people still try and make a go of it in the city until the fighting increases. The film is also about the inaction of the UN. They were late getting involved, and even the troops there didn't do much at first. The West were reluctant to get involving, fearing that it would be a propaganda coup for the Serbs. This was not a good time for Western nations and the UN at this point in history. The acting in this film was excellent, as expected. No one let the film down. They was a fine tort script, preventing the film getting bogged down, and find direction by Michael Winterbottom. They are some shocking and surprise moments, giving the film a more edgy film, and the use of hand-held cameras added to the realist feel. There are some continuous shots which I live and good editing. The use of news footage was also fitting and well done, giving the audience some background information and showing the wider affects of the war with the international community. However, I think some of Winterbottom's music choices were ill-fitting. He used some classic pop song which felt out of context. It does sometimes work, like in Vietnam war film, but that is normally to show the sixties setting and because the films have a longer timeline. However, this is a worthy film about an important war. If you like this then I also recommend Hotel Rwanda and Shooting Dogs are essential viewing.

    This movie brought home to me the scope of the violent chaos in Bosnia, which I had pretty much ignored as a news story. It did not tell me who the various factions were. I learned little of the causes. But it brought into specific relief the horrors of this war and all those like it. When the movie finally settles down and we are familiar with the characters, then the story becomes personalized in one reporter's quest to save one little girl. And it is here that the movie shines. Stephen Dillane is good as the British reporter, trying to make a difference, even at the loss of his journalistic distance and impartiality. Woody Harrelson is spot-on as the wild American journalist. And little Emira Nusevic is excellent as the child in question. Marisa Tomei is very good in the tiny part of a relief worker. It is to her credit that she eschews any semblance of Hollywood glamor and handles his gritty little role perfectly. Why not 10 stars? Well, the first third of the picture is devoted to establishing the chaos and horrors of war, and in doing so leaves the viewer somewhat asea as to what is going on and who the players are, in terms of their relevance to the ultimate story. I think it is a 'must see'.

    6.9 votes equal to fragile. And 'now clear that this site has a strong antipathy towards the horror film. If this movie had been in Stephen King would have had more. For me to go to pieces is the comment by Aaron1375. AARON STILL TU, quache distant relative of SHARON? Restless character already seen previously. Why make comparisons between SILENT HILL AND MIRRORS? E '100 times better this movie. Silent hill comes from a video. Do you have anything like the original film plot. There are mediocre film recited by actors who have high ratings as we are beautiful film recited by people less known. This site is so. In this movie there is a coup scene that leaves us with mouth open the others kind of Nicole Kidman. But since this movie and played by Sutherland takes one vote less. that's disgusting. Arise THE VOTE!

    Just to point out something, that previous comment that said that Muslims weren't the victims in this war, just to tell you, how can anyone know who was the victim and who wasn't? My father lost all of his family in this war, his younger sister was shot right in front of him. His mother died a painful death, today my father has no one to call and check on to, why? because NOT all, but most Serbs who fought the war didn't give a rat's ass if you were a Muslim child, youngster, or if you needed a cane to walk with, all they wanted is murder and believe me i had to witness all of that myself. To generally speak about this movie, i watched it just right now as we speak, and the movie qualifies to show you some of the brutal slaughters that happened during those tragical unbelievable years. You can ask any Bosnian Muslim about the war, and they won't talk about it. My best friend's older brother was 9 years old when he saw Serbian soldiers take his father to his own backyard, torturing him, and killing him in front of his very own child, and then people dare to say that the Serbs were the victims? still this day, my friend's brother has effects from that day, you look at his face and you know that there is something wrong. This isn't basically a movie review, this is MY side of the story on how it happened and on how no one seemed to care about hundreds of children dying each day because some stupid nonsense pricks decided to kill everyone just to have their own F'n independence, well all i can say is i take big Sh.. on your independence. This movie brought my friends to tears, those who don't know 1% about the war, and surely it will bring those who actually lived it. I voted it a 10 just because i am actually glad they show the real side of the war, and how WE were the F'n victims. Hate this comment or love it, i don't care, but at least i shared the truth of my opinion, and the truth of our war.

    Welcome to Sarajevo is the result of a good effort but it is just not gripping like similar movies such as The Year of Living Dangerously. First of all, Woody Harreslson has like a bit part. He isn't even part of any of the major plot movements. He actually stands out like a sore thumb as some dumb, drunk, slightly retarded journalist with absolutely no purpose staggering around in a war zone. Second of all, since the majority of the film centers around trying to get children out of Sarajevo, it probably would have been more fitting to call it "Goodbye Sarajevo." I remember watching the events unfold on the news when this crisis was actually happening, and I have to say I got a better understanding of the situation from that than from this film. Granted, this is a beautifully shot film and it's not the worst war movie ever made, but, oh, it could have been so much more if it actually even attempted to shed some light on the horrors of the siege beyond depicting corpses spilling cherry syrup out of their heads in the street. Very little is explained. Like for example, why and how did the "driver" get shot. Or what was up with that scene during which the reporter dude against better advise just follows some stranger who doesn't even speak English into a room only to get mugged as warned. I couldn't really follow it and therefore didn't really enjoy Welcoem to Sarajevo.

    I'm just writing this review to point one thing out, the true story of Michael Nicholson (whom this movie is based off) involves him adopting and rescuing a Serbian girl named Natasha, not a Bosnian (Muslim) girl named Emira. Plenty of Serbian's themselves died in the siege of Sarajevo as we made up over 1/3 of the cities population. I'm not sure what the motive was behind switching the girl's ethnicity but I can only suspect that it was motivated by Hollywood's desire to uncomplicate a complicated mess as well as pander to public consensus that Serbs were the aggressors and the 'bad' guys while Bosniaks (Muslims) were the victims, 'good' guys. As far as the artistic merits of the movie herself, I liked how she interwove real footage with fiction, blurring the distinction. I also found it refreshing that such a marginal topic was brought to the big studios even though no one really watched. In the end though, the movie was okay, maybe even good but not great. The acting was fairly flat and the character development was mostly two dimensional. When the movie finishes, you forget about it.

    The Bosnian War was one of the most brutal war in recent years, with hundred thousands people being killed, and Bosnians and Muslims were killed. It was a conflicted that showed the weakness of the UN, and took time for the West to get involved. Sarajevo itself became a war zone the centre because a no-mans land. Welcome to Sarajevo starts in the early days of the Bosnian war in 1992. Sarajevo is besieged by the Serbian forces and Bosnians are being rounded up to locked up or killed. An ITN reporter Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane) is assigned to cover the war-zone. Sarajevo is a place where snipers are hunting on the roof-tops and shooting people who dare cross the streets: including children and journalists. In the city Michael befriends Flynn (Woody Harrelson), a American journalist who has a seemingly uncaring attitude, but is really interested about the people. Michael ends up reporting about an orphanage and the children on the frontline. He becomes very involved with the story, reporting on it every night and start a campaign to get governments involves. When a Children's Charities is able to evacuate some children and babies to relatives abroad and in Italy Michael becomes involved. He ends up taking a care of one nine year old girl, Emira (Emira Nusevic), who ends up living with his family based in London. This film is based on a true story, with some names and events changed to moral and dramatic reasons. But the issues of the film is the same. Michael Henderson was bit like Oscar Schlinder, an ordinary person thrown into a extraordinary circumstances. But the twist is as a journalist he was not meant to get too involved, but he broke that golden rule of journalism. It is a film about the ethics of journalism and when someone should get involved with the issues there are reporting. The film is also about the war, and random killings that happened in the conflict. Civilians were hurt and killed and non-Serbs were rounded up. Serbia has always seen itself as a nation that had a right in nations like Bosnia and Crotia, and wanting to ensure power for the Serbian minorities. Serbia has often been a power broker in the region since World War I. Sarajevo itself was a shell of a city, with it being a live and death struggle. Electricity cuts are normal, and water supplies are short. But some people still try and make a go of it in the city until the fighting increases. The film is also about the inaction of the UN. They were late getting involved, and even the troops there didn't do much at first. The West were reluctant to get involving, fearing that it would be a propaganda coup for the Serbs. This was not a good time for Western nations and the UN at this point in history. The acting in this film was excellent, as expected. No one let the film down. They was a fine tort script, preventing the film getting bogged down, and find direction by Michael Winterbottom. They are some shocking and surprise moments, giving the film a more edgy film, and the use of hand-held cameras added to the realist feel. There are some continuous shots which I live and good editing. The use of news footage was also fitting and well done, giving the audience some background information and showing the wider affects of the war with the international community. However, I think some of Winterbottom's music choices were ill-fitting. He used some classic pop song which felt out of context. It does sometimes work, like in Vietnam war film, but that is normally to show the sixties setting and because the films have a longer timeline. However, this is a worthy film about an important war. If you like this then I also recommend Hotel Rwanda and Shooting Dogs are essential viewing.

    This movie brought home to me the scope of the violent chaos in Bosnia, which I had pretty much ignored as a news story. It did not tell me who the various factions were. I learned little of the causes. But it brought into specific relief the horrors of this war and all those like it. When the movie finally settles down and we are familiar with the characters, then the story becomes personalized in one reporter's quest to save one little girl. And it is here that the movie shines. Stephen Dillane is good as the British reporter, trying to make a difference, even at the loss of his journalistic distance and impartiality. Woody Harrelson is spot-on as the wild American journalist. And little Emira Nusevic is excellent as the child in question. Marisa Tomei is very good in the tiny part of a relief worker. It is to her credit that she eschews any semblance of Hollywood glamor and handles his gritty little role perfectly. Why not 10 stars? Well, the first third of the picture is devoted to establishing the chaos and horrors of war, and in doing so leaves the viewer somewhat asea as to what is going on and who the players are, in terms of their relevance to the ultimate story. I think it is a 'must see'.

    6.9 votes equal to fragile. And 'now clear that this site has a strong antipathy towards the horror film. If this movie had been in Stephen King would have had more. For me to go to pieces is the comment by Aaron1375. AARON STILL TU, quache distant relative of SHARON? Restless character already seen previously. Why make comparisons between SILENT HILL AND MIRRORS? E '100 times better this movie. Silent hill comes from a video. Do you have anything like the original film plot. There are mediocre film recited by actors who have high ratings as we are beautiful film recited by people less known. This site is so. In this movie there is a coup scene that leaves us with mouth open the others kind of Nicole Kidman. But since this movie and played by Sutherland takes one vote less. that's disgusting. Arise THE VOTE!

    Just to point out something, that previous comment that said that Muslims weren't the victims in this war, just to tell you, how can anyone know who was the victim and who wasn't? My father lost all of his family in this war, his younger sister was shot right in front of him. His mother died a painful death, today my father has no one to call and check on to, why? because NOT all, but most Serbs who fought the war didn't give a rat's ass if you were a Muslim child, youngster, or if you needed a cane to walk with, all they wanted is murder and believe me i had to witness all of that myself. To generally speak about this movie, i watched it just right now as we speak, and the movie qualifies to show you some of the brutal slaughters that happened during those tragical unbelievable years. You can ask any Bosnian Muslim about the war, and they won't talk about it. My best friend's older brother was 9 years old when he saw Serbian soldiers take his father to his own backyard, torturing him, and killing him in front of his very own child, and then people dare to say that the Serbs were the victims? still this day, my friend's brother has effects from that day, you look at his face and you know that there is something wrong. This isn't basically a movie review, this is MY side of the story on how it happened and on how no one seemed to care about hundreds of children dying each day because some stupid nonsense pricks decided to kill everyone just to have their own F'n independence, well all i can say is i take big Sh.. on your independence. This movie brought my friends to tears, those who don't know 1% about the war, and surely it will bring those who actually lived it. I voted it a 10 just because i am actually glad they show the real side of the war, and how WE were the F'n victims. Hate this comment or love it, i don't care, but at least i shared the truth of my opinion, and the truth of our war.

    This film is about a group of journalist covering the news of the war in Sarajevo. They have decided to take the matter into their own hands as the West fails to do anything about it. "Welcome to Sarajevo" is a striking, engaging and saddening drama. It is raw, brutal, and it evokes so much emotions in me. The usage of real documentary footage in the film enhances the realism and shock effect of the film. Indeed, it is hard to watch all the dead bodies on the roadside. And the United Nations spokesman saying there are thirteen places worse than Sarajevo provokes so much anger in me. The bureaucracy is scandalous and heinous. It is so hard to see lives lost, dreams shattered and cities destroyed. One of Flynn's lines about if the attacking side was reversed may well be right. Apart from raising awareness, sympathy, despair and anger, "Welcome to Sarajevo" also looks at ethical issues of who is to decide what is right for the people. "Welcome to Sarajevo" is engaging and well made. It deserves more attention than it is getting.

    The movie was depressing. Thats because it told the war like it is. Its true that both sides suffered in the war, but one side suffered a cut while the other side was cut in half. I liked how the movie depicted the situation as it was, and illustrated the media as a corporate entity trying to make money and advance themselves to the "first page" of the paper as opposed to something overly sympathetic. Bottom line, it was believable. My knock against the movie was the ending. I suppose the directors left the ending open and up in the air, just like the war. You think you have an idea of what may happen, but you really have no idea at all. So it was symbolic, but the whole movie didn't follow this theme, rather it was a story, and naturally you want to see how it ends.

    With the two sides in the Bosnian war producing significant civilian casualties a third force enters the conflict zone. Armed with cameras and microphones, they are the eyes and ears of the West through the daily news. Among them is serious British journalist Michael Henderson and the more flamboyant American Flynn. While the latter is concerned with his ratings and manages to stay relaxed with all the violence around him, the former becomes tied up with the plight of the children in an orphanage on the front line and loses his distance from the story as he tries to force someone, anyone, to get the children out of the war zone. The film opens with a scene that sums the evil nature of the Bosnia conflict up perfectly when one of a wedding party is picked off by a sniper. It is an impacting way to open a film and the script more or less maintains this across the film in one way or another. The plot is hardly anything too original as mostly it relies on Henderson getting personally involved in his story to provide a narrative frame for the conflict but the film uses it well. Winterbottom was a good choice for director because he doesn't over-egg the emotion or push the narrative beyond what it can cope with. Instead he uses it well to tell one story without ever losing sight of the fact that it is just one story among millions. This worked well for me as I found the bigger picture to be the more engaging side of the film but appreciated the structure given the subject by the narrative; this way it remains impacting on a political level while also looking at the personal, human level. With the time the relevance of the film will fade as the conflict becomes something in the past  I don't mean this coldly but just suggest that something fresh in our collective memories will be of more relevant than something in the "past". The film retains its impact because it does shown more than the news showed but what I found more distressing was the fact that the same attacks on the media and our politicians could be launched about many conflicts since. Welcome to Dafour, Rwanda, Iraq  take your pick. How many times do we see our "leaders" quibble over the legal definition of genocide while the news footage shows us images of corpses and the suffering of civilians? Winterbottom uses news footage within his material to good effect to highlight the stupidity and hypocrisy of the world leaders in the face of such horror and few viewers will take too much issue with the lack of balance in this regard; it is a strength of the film that these points are still valid but I truly wish that they weren't. The cast take to this serious material well and produce some solid performances while also knowing their place within the bigger picture and not showboating or overdoing things. Dillane is the best example of this as he is technically the lead character but yet holds back and shows restraint to the point of keeping his story from dominating the film  it is a good show and Winterbottom also deserves credit for helping him produce this. Looking at it cynically, Harrelson and Tomei were added to sell the film and this is mostly what they do; however both are solid albeit in smaller roles than some viewers will expect. Nesbitt, Fox, Visnjic and Nusevic all produce solid support and more than stand up alongside Dillane's lead. The most important delivery is that of the conflict itself and Winterbottom does that well. Some viewers have bemoaned the lack of context or explanation of the conflict but to me this was a good call because what matters is that civilians were slaughtered and suffering, when this is the case what does it matter what the reasons for it are? Overall then a solid and impacting film. It doesn't have the most balance in the world but it is well worth a watch for what it does well and, sadly, the continuing relevance in current conflicts around the world today.

    Welcome to Sarajevo (1997)directed by Michael Winterbottom is an official selection in 1997 FESTIVAL DE CANNES and was also runner up for Golden Palm. Three days ago I knew nothing about Sarajevo, except I knew a little about "SARAJEVO FILM FESTIVAL. I had a lucid dream on August 1st 2013 that, "I am in the city of SARAJEVO, This dream was as clear as real life, I was able to observe the buildings, Monuments, Restaurants, Cafes, People everything. It was an amazing experience, and above all I was able to remember everything in the same vivid form when I woke up." I did Image search on Google to verify the images from my dreams and this is how I came to know about The Film "Welcome To Sarajevo" and than I managed to watch it. The Visuals in the film penetrated my feeling and my whole existence as a human. The Film is based on Bosnian War from 1992 to 1996, During this period Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was besieged by the Army of Republika Srpska. The film exactly doesn't discuss the cause of the Bosnian war, It is more a personal interpretation of ITN reporter Henderson, his cameraman Greg and producer Jane Carson who is reporting the war in SARAJEVO. But many sequences of mass killing & ethnic cleansing in the film which i think has been grabbed form the original news footage of brutality of Serb soldiers. When we see a war film, I think there is something more important than the plot, treatment, performance of the Actors or Visual effects etc. I feel that the lessons of the dark sides of time and history it is trying to deliver us must be taken very seriously. And we must not consider it as any other ordinary film we watch in our everyday life. The Bosnian war is the most recent page written in black letters in the history of Europe. And after watching "Welcome to Sarajevo" I was able to develop a personal point of view about the design of war in human Life. I am taking this film just as an example, But I am talking in general. As humans we think that we are divided and discriminated geographically, and in cast, religion, race and In Majority or minorities. But I think it's an illusion which has been created for us from ancient times to perceive the world in this way. So, that we should never unite. In reality the world is discriminated in three parts - 1. Who has access to all the resources in the world, and owns all the muscle power. 2. The middle class people, who serve the existence of the 1st category. 3.Who only relies on the kindness of the first two category, they don't even have access to basic resources food, cloth, shelter etc. Except the first category other two hold no power or authority. They are just like puppets. They are meant to live on the mercy of the government or the extremist and they have to die with the wish of the government and the extremist. And it is like that because we have no will and we have never been able to develop the will against the government or the extremist. The war is the most lucrative business for politicians and capitalist and The news and stories of war is the most sell-able and entertaining. And while sitting in a warm comfortable room who cares about causalities of war happens in the front line. What I am trying to say that we need to develop the resistance and strength against the will of the group of people who sponsor war and causalities. Else like SARAJEVO any city in the world could become next hellish city for a while. It is time to go against the patterns we have been following. It seems completely awkward to me that The priest bless the Weapons and Soldiers and the same priest ask the people to be generous and kind and compassionate. What a contradiction ?,Yes ! People should be kind and compassionate so, they should be killed easily. We must develop our knowledge and inner understanding, So that we can understand the intent of the people who try to control everything in the world. Being the follower of extremist belief or sect will only give birth to more stories of war & brutality. By referring to the climax of "Welcome to Sarajevo"with a "concert of peace" on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, Where Harun playing his cello to hundreds of Sarajevans. I appeal to pray for peace in the world. I recommend to include this film in the film study course by all the film schools in the world because of it's original treatment and honest storytelling. And Next time whenever you watch a war film, think deeply, and think about other side of it. Don't just get yourself entertained.

For me to go to pieces is the comment by Aaron1375. AARON STILL TU, quache distant relative of SHARON? Restless character already seen previously. Why make comparisons between SILENT HILL AND MIRRORS? E '100 times better this movie. Silent hill comes from a video. Do you have anything like the original film plot. There are mediocre film recited by actors who have high ratings as we are beautiful film recited by people less known. This site is so. In this movie there is a coup scene that leaves us with mouth open the others kind of Nicole Kidman. But since this movie and played by Sutherland takes one vote less. that's disgusting. Arise THE VOTE!

    Just to point out something, that previous comment that said that Muslims weren't the victims in this war, just to tell you, how can anyone know who was the victim and who wasn't? My father lost all of his family in this war, his younger sister was shot right in front of him. His mother died a painful death, today my father has no one to call and check on to, why? because NOT all, but most Serbs who fought the war didn't give a rat's ass if you were a Muslim child, youngster, or if you needed a cane to walk with, all they wanted is murder and believe me i had to witness all of that myself. To generally speak about this movie, i watched it just right now as we speak, and the movie qualifies to show you some of the brutal slaughters that happened during those tragical unbelievable years. You can ask any Bosnian Muslim about the war, and they won't talk about it. My best friend's older brother was 9 years old when he saw Serbian soldiers take his father to his own backyard, torturing him, and killing him in front of his very own child, and then people dare to say that the Serbs were the victims? still this day, my friend's brother has effects from that day, you look at his face and you know that there is something wrong. This isn't basically a movie review, this is MY side of the story on how it happened and on how no one seemed to care about hundreds of children dying each day because some stupid nonsense pricks decided to kill everyone just to have their own F'n independence, well all i can say is i take big Sh.. on your independence. This movie brought my friends to tears, those who don't know 1% about the war, and surely it will bring those who actually lived it. I voted it a 10 just because i am actually glad they show the real side of the war, and how WE were the F'n victims. Hate this comment or love it, i don't care, but at least i shared the truth of my opinion, and the truth of our war.

    This film is about a group of journalist covering the news of the war in Sarajevo. They have decided to take the matter into their own hands as the West fails to do anything about it. "Welcome to Sarajevo" is a striking, engaging and saddening drama. It is raw, brutal, and it evokes so much emotions in me. The usage of real documentary footage in the film enhances the realism and shock effect of the film. Indeed, it is hard to watch all the dead bodies on the roadside. And the United Nations spokesman saying there are thirteen places worse than Sarajevo provokes so much anger in me. The bureaucracy is scandalous and heinous. It is so hard to see lives lost, dreams shattered and cities destroyed. One of Flynn's lines about if the attacking side was reversed may well be right. Apart from raising awareness, sympathy, despair and anger, "Welcome to Sarajevo" also looks at ethical issues of who is to decide what is right for the people. "Welcome to Sarajevo" is engaging and well made. It deserves more attention than it is getting.

    The movie was depressing. Thats because it told the war like it is. Its true that both sides suffered in the war, but one side suffered a cut while the other side was cut in half. I liked how the movie depicted the situation as it was, and illustrated the media as a corporate entity trying to make money and advance themselves to the "first page" of the paper as opposed to something overly sympathetic. Bottom line, it was believable. My knock against the movie was the ending. I suppose the directors left the ending open and up in the air, just like the war. You think you have an idea of what may happen, but you really have no idea at all. So it was symbolic, but the whole movie didn't follow this theme, rather it was a story, and naturally you want to see how it ends.

    With the two sides in the Bosnian war producing significant civilian casualties a third force enters the conflict zone. Armed with cameras and microphones, they are the eyes and ears of the West through the daily news. Among them is serious British journalist Michael Henderson and the more flamboyant American Flynn. While the latter is concerned with his ratings and manages to stay relaxed with all the violence around him, the former becomes tied up with the plight of the children in an orphanage on the front line and loses his distance from the story as he tries to force someone, anyone, to get the children out of the war zone. The film opens with a scene that sums the evil nature of the Bosnia conflict up perfectly when one of a wedding party is picked off by a sniper. It is an impacting way to open a film and the script more or less maintains this across the film in one way or another. The plot is hardly anything too original as mostly it relies on Henderson getting personally involved in his story to provide a narrative frame for the conflict but the film uses it well. Winterbottom was a good choice for director because he doesn't over-egg the emotion or push the narrative beyond what it can cope with. Instead he uses it well to tell one story without ever losing sight of the fact that it is just one story among millions. This worked well for me as I found the bigger picture to be the more engaging side of the film but appreciated the structure given the subject by the narrative; this way it remains impacting on a political level while also looking at the personal, human level. With the time the relevance of the film will fade as the conflict becomes something in the past  I don't mean this coldly but just suggest that something fresh in our collective memories will be of more relevant than something in the "past". The film retains its impact because it does shown more than the news showed but what I found more distressing was the fact that the same attacks on the media and our politicians could be launched about many conflicts since. Welcome to Dafour, Rwanda, Iraq  take your pick. How many times do we see our "leaders" quibble over the legal definition of genocide while the news footage shows us images of corpses and the suffering of civilians? Winterbottom uses news footage within his material to good effect to highlight the stupidity and hypocrisy of the world leaders in the face of such horror and few viewers will take too much issue with the lack of balance in this regard; it is a strength of the film that these points are still valid but I truly wish that they weren't. The cast take to this serious material well and produce some solid performances while also knowing their place within the bigger picture and not showboating or overdoing things. Dillane is the best example of this as he is technically the lead character but yet holds back and shows restraint to the point of keeping his story from dominating the film  it is a good show and Winterbottom also deserves credit for helping him produce this. Looking at it cynically, Harrelson and Tomei were added to sell the film and this is mostly what they do; however both are solid albeit in smaller roles than some viewers will expect. Nesbitt, Fox, Visnjic and Nusevic all produce solid support and more than stand up alongside Dillane's lead. The most important delivery is that of the conflict itself and Winterbottom does that well. Some viewers have bemoaned the lack of context or explanation of the conflict but to me this was a good call because what matters is that civilians were slaughtered and suffering, when this is the case what does it matter what the reasons for it are? Overall then a solid and impacting film. It doesn't have the most balance in the world but it is well worth a watch for what it does well and, sadly, the continuing relevance in current conflicts around the world today.
