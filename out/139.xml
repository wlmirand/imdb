    What tends to happen over Christmas is that often an entire series of films will be shown on a channel over consecutive days and sure enough, the BBC didn't disappoint. The fact that most people over the age of thirty will have already seen this matters not a jot as it remains a highly enjoyable slice of family fun from when Disney were at their best. Some films aren't meant to be taken seriously - in fact, I can think of plenty that aren't - but the tale of a beat-up VW Beetle with a mind of its own offers a rarely-seen mix of magic, entertainment and a chance to regress to a more innocent time, when the Sixties were in full swing and not everything was about making money. Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) is a washed-up racing driver living in San Fransisco with his eccentric friend Tennessee (Buddy Hackett). After crashing out of his latest outing, Jim walks the streets in search of inspiration. Instead, he falls head-over-heels for showroom assistant Carole (Michele Lee) who works with the dastardly Thorndyke (David Tomlinson). Jim finds himself acquiring an old Volkwagen Beetle from Thorndyke, who is happy to see the back of it, but Jim soon finds that "Herbie" seems to have a mind of its own. And when Jim's fortunes on the track improve when he begins racing in "Herbie", Thorndyke will stop at nothing to reclaim the car for his own personal gain. The plot is plainly ridiculous but once "The Love Bug" starts, it sweeps you into the most absurd adventure that it's impossible not to enjoy it. It's fun in an old-fashioned sense, little things like the slapstick oil leaks onto Thorndyke's shoes or face or the crude effects behind Herbie's unusual turn of speed. And yet, the effects don't detract from the film - this is film-making the way it used to be before CG made everything "better" (or cheaper) - nothing like the recent "Herbie: Fully Loaded" outing. The best thing is the car itself which is full of life and personality without the need to slap a face on it. It rattles and rolls as if it truly is alive - a marvellous effort that has to be admired. If anything, he's much more interesting and entertaining than the human cast although Hackett's bizarre performance is worth a mention and Tomlinson also does well as Thorndyke, who's a mere moustache-twiddle away from being Dick Dastardly or Terry Thomas. "The Love Bug" is obviously very dated and very much a product of its time - the drive-in diner scene with the two hippies reinforced that quite clearly - but this remains an enjoyable and delightfully daft family film to entertain kids of all ages. My wife, who was chuckling throughout, is typical of a viewer who, despite having seen it before, still found the time to enjoy it anew with this viewer who watched it for the first time. Not many films aimed at kids last as long as this and the fact that people still speak of this movie with fond memories speaks volumes. Grab your leathers and enjoy this petrol-headed piece of motoring joy.

    Disney gives no death or injury count for the opening credits, but San Francisco race-car driver Dean Jones (as Jim Douglas) emerges with only a scratch. Totally wiped-out and looking for a new car, Mr. Jones is attracted to the legs of mini-skirted Michele Lee (as Carole Bennett). She works for car dealer and racing rival David Tomlinson (as Peter Thorndike), who treats a shiny white 1963 Volkswagen Beetle badly. Jones defends the VW and the car literally follows him home. It tries to match him up with Ms. Lee, after the two don't hit it off as expected. Jones' Buddhist mechanic Buddy Hackett (as Tennessee Steinmetz) names the car "Herbie" after his uncle. Jones takes the car on the racing circuit, ending in a big finish. This occasionally idiotic but often amusing film made driving in a VW more fun. "Herbie" and the setting make it hum. ****** The Love Bug (12/24/68) Robert Stevenson ~ Dean Jones, Michele Lee, Buddy Hackett, David Tomlinson

    Man meets car, romance ensues. It was one of my favorites when I was younger, especially Buddy Hackett, who makes the movie, as far as I'm concerned. The special effects were great, and the supporting characters (David Tomlinson, especially), make it re-watchable. I remember vividly how VWs took off like crazy after this movie came out. Since one of my aunts had a VW Bug AND looked almost exactly like Michelle Lee, I used to love going to visit her. I always expected the car to split in half or do a wheelie. The one thing that has always bugged me about the movie is how they NEVER call it a Volkswagen - always "the little car" or something.

    I had seen the modern Lindsay Lohan/Michael Keaton remake of the classic collection of films about the living car, Herbie: Fully Loaded, and it was right I should see the first of the old ones, from director Robert Stevenson (Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks). Basically down on his luck racing car driver Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) and his friend, occasionally drunk mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz (The Little Mermaid's Buddy Hackett), live together in an old run down fire house. One day Jim goes to a luxury car dealership and wants something in a rather low price range, but mean dealer Peter Thorndyke (Mary Poppins' David Tomlinson) has no interest in helping him. Then Jim spots a strange car, an old Vauxwagen Beetle, and after managing to take it away with him, it proves to be an unusual car, it has a mind of its own driving where it wants to. He believes Thorndyke planted the car on purpose, but dealer assistant Carole Bennett (Michele Lee) proves the car is a good purchase, only to discover the car is living as well, and Jim has found a love interest. After being fixed up Jim, and given the name "Herbie" by Tennessee, the car is more controlled by its driver, and with a high speed they start racing to be champions, against Thorndyke, who wants the car back. After Thorndyke sabotages one race to win, the big race called the "El Dorado" is on the way, and there is a point when you wonder if Herbie will go to it, but after the apologies, he does. So the two lap gets started, with Thorndyke seeming to cheat his way to the lead, but Jim, Carole and Tennessee in Herbie manage to catch up and eventually win the race. Also starring Joe Flynn as Havershaw, Benson Fong as Mr. Wu, Andy Granatelli as Association President and Joe E. Ross as Detective. The car doesn't have as much personality as perhaps the remake version does, Tomlinson makes a reasonably mean villain, like a live version Dick Dastardly, and the jokes are alright, it is something the family will enjoy, an alright comedy. It was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!

    I was surprised at how much I enjoyed The Love Bug. It is such good fun, and I do agree that it is by far and away the best movie of the series. The story is simple but well structured and interesting and the dialogue has its fair share of very funny and somewhat poignant moments. The photography is nice to look at, the direction is on target, the pacing is snappy and the soundtrack is lovely. The entire cast from Buddy Hackett, Dean Jones, Joe Flynn and Michelle Lee is very strong, but at the end of the day Herbie is the one who steals the show, quite cute and endearing for a car Herbie is. All in all, while not the best of the live-action Disney movies being a touch too long, it is thoroughly enjoyable and I can see completely why people love it. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    What to say about this movie its so good and well made its so amazing Disney put more time on this movie then he did with any other Herbie films this one has to be the best in the series its my favorite Herbie movie they put this movie on car who has a mind of its own and I really like Volkswagens and this one has a name he's name Herbie with love in the air and happens in is heart its very funny and fun and it looks so realist. I don't care how many people say how cheesy it is its a amazing Herbie you showed every one love and care you are very fast car you should really get 7.3 out of 10. I now what I am thinking this movie should be rated a 7.3 out of 10 for its true rating who ever rated a 6.3 out of 10 for this movie should be shot its the best in series and by for to be own DVD I have got it on DVD I have not seen it on DVD at the shops for couples time maybe its such a good movie. OK here are some changes I want to see on the rating for this movie I want to see a 7.3 out of 10 for its true rating OK thats good for me and for my rating I give this movie a 10 out of 10. very good this movie brought back one of my childhood.

    What originally started out as an idea suggested to Walt Disney by 'stock' actor Dean Jones about the first European sports car to come to America, ended up being swept into one of Disney's most lovable and most memorable characters, Herbie. The 1963 VW who has a mind and heart of HIS own. Although Walt Disney had started a basis about a car-type movie, screenwriter Gordon Bufford came in a wrote a screenplay called 'Thunderbug' which later changes to many numerous other titles such as 'Car-Boy-Girl' and the idiotic 'Magic Volksy'. What resulted was 'The Love Bug'. Jim Douglas is a well known track car racer who is real big on doing demolition derby-type races. He lives in an old firehouse with a mechanic friend of his named Tennessee (Buddy Hackett). The two of them have a strong feeling for cars and have literally turned their home into a garage over piled with car parts and tools. One day, everything changes when Jim stumbles upon a white 1963 VW who has a mind of its own. Jim and Tennessee end up getting involved with this strange little car and notice its not LIKE ANY OTHERS. Jim realizes that this car would dominate racing tracks across the country (Tennessee names the car Herbie). Jim Douglas and his car become quite famous on the race track and build up competition with an auto dealer who drives the most fast cars equipped for racing. I can't really explain the plot too well, so I suggest you just see it for yourself. The bottom line is that Herbie has a heart and mind of his own and can control himself when he wants too. This movie and its sequels are really good (although I can't really say the same for Herbie:Fully Loaded though). These movies will make you laugh and you'll have a fun time watching them, as usual with most older Disney movies. This movie is a perfect model as to what older Disney films were about. Most starred adults and were really cool and fun to watch. Now Disney seems to be designing garbage for sex predators. Every movie is with girls in tight clothes and young dating and each kid has one parent, and they play soccer, plus fart jokes and some sort of talking animal. Pixar's films are good, but anything released outside of that is CRAP 99.5% of the time. That's because Disney is no longer a person, its a name, a product used up to get some CEO his 9.6 million dollar mansion in the Hamptons or wherever. The original essence of Disney has been lost. Now I know Disney was meant for kids, but don't take it literally by having kids as the actual stars !

    This movie has something for everyone, comedy romance back in a time when Disney knew how to make a family film. The Love bug is the story of a man who meets an extraordinary car and how said car changes his life. This movie has a bit of everything, comedy, appeal to kids, romance, racing, Disney villains who are as likable as they are bad. One of the essential to watch Disney movies in my humble opinion. The background music really went to support the film. The footage wasn't always best shots but hey it was the 60s and I think it helps keep the feel of that era looking like that. Overall this movie is the reason that people know who Herbie is today and the reason he has become as iconic as many of their cartoon characters.

    Before "Knight Rider" or "Speed Buggy",there was Herbie. This spunky Volkswagon can win a race whenever he can! Hardly anyone can control this machinery, he tends to think on its own. Here you have a racer named Jim Douglas(Dean Jones), a racer who lives for the thrill. Known for wrecking cars, he gets a chance to go on the racing field once again. He and his partner Tennessee Steimetz(Buddy Hackett) get the car and the fun begins. Both he and Herbie get the glory, but the owner of foreign cars has other plans. He wanted to get Herbie out of action, permanently! Carole Bennett(Michele Lee)decides to join forces with Jim and Tennessee, and make sure that Peter Thorndyke(David Tomlinson) don't get all the glory. There was a lot of humor in the race when the bear took the saboteur's place when trying to keep Herbie from winning. And who needed a chauffeur when you have Herbie doing the driving. A great movie, family friendly, and true gem that can make you sparkle. For all you grease-monkeys, here's a movie for you! Also it was my nickname. HAHAHA!!! 5 STARS!

    Disney gives no death or injury count for the opening credits, but San Francisco race-car driver Dean Jones (as Jim Douglas) emerges with only a scratch. Totally wiped-out and looking for a new car, Mr. Jones is attracted to the legs of mini-skirted Michele Lee (as Carole Bennett). She works for car dealer and racing rival David Tomlinson (as Peter Thorndike), who treats a shiny white 1963 Volkswagen Beetle badly. Jones defends the VW and the car literally follows him home. It tries to match him up with Ms. Lee, after the two don't hit it off as expected. Jones' Buddhist mechanic Buddy Hackett (as Tennessee Steinmetz) names the car "Herbie" after his uncle. Jones takes the car on the racing circuit, ending in a big finish. This occasionally idiotic but often amusing film made driving in a VW more fun. "Herbie" and the setting make it hum. ****** The Love Bug (12/24/68) Robert Stevenson ~ Dean Jones, Michele Lee, Buddy Hackett, David Tomlinson

    Man meets car, romance ensues. It was one of my favorites when I was younger, especially Buddy Hackett, who makes the movie, as far as I'm concerned. The special effects were great, and the supporting characters (David Tomlinson, especially), make it re-watchable. I remember vividly how VWs took off like crazy after this movie came out. Since one of my aunts had a VW Bug AND looked almost exactly like Michelle Lee, I used to love going to visit her. I always expected the car to split in half or do a wheelie. The one thing that has always bugged me about the movie is how they NEVER call it a Volkswagen - always "the little car" or something.

    I had seen the modern Lindsay Lohan/Michael Keaton remake of the classic collection of films about the living car, Herbie: Fully Loaded, and it was right I should see the first of the old ones, from director Robert Stevenson (Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks). Basically down on his luck racing car driver Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) and his friend, occasionally drunk mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz (The Little Mermaid's Buddy Hackett), live together in an old run down fire house. One day Jim goes to a luxury car dealership and wants something in a rather low price range, but mean dealer Peter Thorndyke (Mary Poppins' David Tomlinson) has no interest in helping him. Then Jim spots a strange car, an old Vauxwagen Beetle, and after managing to take it away with him, it proves to be an unusual car, it has a mind of its own driving where it wants to. He believes Thorndyke planted the car on purpose, but dealer assistant Carole Bennett (Michele Lee) proves the car is a good purchase, only to discover the car is living as well, and Jim has found a love interest. After being fixed up Jim, and given the name "Herbie" by Tennessee, the car is more controlled by its driver, and with a high speed they start racing to be champions, against Thorndyke, who wants the car back. After Thorndyke sabotages one race to win, the big race called the "El Dorado" is on the way, and there is a point when you wonder if Herbie will go to it, but after the apologies, he does. So the two lap gets started, with Thorndyke seeming to cheat his way to the lead, but Jim, Carole and Tennessee in Herbie manage to catch up and eventually win the race. Also starring Joe Flynn as Havershaw, Benson Fong as Mr. Wu, Andy Granatelli as Association President and Joe E. Ross as Detective. The car doesn't have as much personality as perhaps the remake version does, Tomlinson makes a reasonably mean villain, like a live version Dick Dastardly, and the jokes are alright, it is something the family will enjoy, an alright comedy. It was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!

    I was surprised at how much I enjoyed The Love Bug. It is such good fun, and I do agree that it is by far and away the best movie of the series. The story is simple but well structured and interesting and the dialogue has its fair share of very funny and somewhat poignant moments. The photography is nice to look at, the direction is on target, the pacing is snappy and the soundtrack is lovely. The entire cast from Buddy Hackett, Dean Jones, Joe Flynn and Michelle Lee is very strong, but at the end of the day Herbie is the one who steals the show, quite cute and endearing for a car Herbie is. All in all, while not the best of the live-action Disney movies being a touch too long, it is thoroughly enjoyable and I can see completely why people love it. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    What to say about this movie its so good and well made its so amazing Disney put more time on this movie then he did with any other Herbie films this one has to be the best in the series its my favorite Herbie movie they put this movie on car who has a mind of its own and I really like Volkswagens and this one has a name he's name Herbie with love in the air and happens in is heart its very funny and fun and it looks so realist. I don't care how many people say how cheesy it is its a amazing Herbie you showed every one love and care you are very fast car you should really get 7.3 out of 10.

    What originally started out as an idea suggested to Walt Disney by 'stock' actor Dean Jones about the first European sports car to come to America, ended up being swept into one of Disney's most lovable and most memorable characters, Herbie. The 1963 VW who has a mind and heart of HIS own. Although Walt Disney had started a basis about a car-type movie, screenwriter Gordon Bufford came in a wrote a screenplay called 'Thunderbug' which later changes to many numerous other titles such as 'Car-Boy-Girl' and the idiotic 'Magic Volksy'. What resulted was 'The Love Bug'. Jim Douglas is a well known track car racer who is real big on doing demolition derby-type races. He lives in an old firehouse with a mechanic friend of his named Tennessee (Buddy Hackett). The two of them have a strong feeling for cars and have literally turned their home into a garage over piled with car parts and tools. One day, everything changes when Jim stumbles upon a white 1963 VW who has a mind of its own. Jim and Tennessee end up getting involved with this strange little car and notice its not LIKE ANY OTHERS. Jim realizes that this car would dominate racing tracks across the country (Tennessee names the car Herbie). Jim Douglas and his car become quite famous on the race track and build up competition with an auto dealer who drives the most fast cars equipped for racing. I can't really explain the plot too well, so I suggest you just see it for yourself. The bottom line is that Herbie has a heart and mind of his own and can control himself when he wants too. This movie and its sequels are really good (although I can't really say the same for Herbie:Fully Loaded though). These movies will make you laugh and you'll have a fun time watching them, as usual with most older Disney movies. This movie is a perfect model as to what older Disney films were about. Most starred adults and were really cool and fun to watch. Now Disney seems to be designing garbage for sex predators. Every movie is with girls in tight clothes and young dating and each kid has one parent, and they play soccer, plus fart jokes and some sort of talking animal. Pixar's films are good, but anything released outside of that is CRAP 99.5% of the time. That's because Disney is no longer a person, its a name, a product used up to get some CEO his 9.6 million dollar mansion in the Hamptons or wherever. The original essence of Disney has been lost. Now I know Disney was meant for kids, but don't take it literally by having kids as the actual stars !

    This movie has something for everyone, comedy romance back in a time when Disney knew how to make a family film. The Love bug is the story of a man who meets an extraordinary car and how said car changes his life. This movie has a bit of everything, comedy, appeal to kids, romance, racing, Disney villains who are as likable as they are bad. One of the essential to watch Disney movies in my humble opinion. The background music really went to support the film. The footage wasn't always best shots but hey it was the 60s and I think it helps keep the feel of that era looking like that. Overall this movie is the reason that people know who Herbie is today and the reason he has become as iconic as many of their cartoon characters.

    Before "Knight Rider" or "Speed Buggy",there was Herbie. This spunky Volkswagon can win a race whenever he can! Hardly anyone can control this machinery, he tends to think on its own. Here you have a racer named Jim Douglas(Dean Jones), a racer who lives for the thrill. Known for wrecking cars, he gets a chance to go on the racing field once again. He and his partner Tennessee Steimetz(Buddy Hackett) get the car and the fun begins. Both he and Herbie get the glory, but the owner of foreign cars has other plans. He wanted to get Herbie out of action, permanently! Carole Bennett(Michele Lee)decides to join forces with Jim and Tennessee, and make sure that Peter Thorndyke(David Tomlinson) don't get all the glory. There was a lot of humor in the race when the bear took the saboteur's place when trying to keep Herbie from winning. And who needed a chauffeur when you have Herbie doing the driving. A great movie, family friendly, and true gem that can make you sparkle. For all you grease-monkeys, here's a movie for you! Also it was my nickname. HAHAHA!!! 5 STARS!

    Amusing and funny first installment with the &uml;Wolkswagen Love Bug&uml; racing the tracks . Love Bug's outing in which Herbie is racing in competitions , it is full of pranks and car stunts that are great fun to see . Agreeable Disney's love bug Wolkswagen plenty of action , slapdash , laughs and entertainment . This hilarious Herbie story concerns about The Love Bug falls 'hood-over-wheels' for a classy chassis! . It deals with a down-on-his-luck race car pilot named Jim Douglas (Dean Jones who also plays the role of the hippy in the drive-in scene), who lives in an old run-down fire mansion in San Francisco with his partner , an occasional alcoholic mechanic called Tennessee Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett) . One day, Jim goes to a car seller and surprisingly sees a rare Volkswagon Beetle with a unusual problem, it tends to drive on its own will . Then, Jim and Tennessee who dubbed the car "Herbie" fixed it and now is under control . After that , Jim used Herbie for notorious international races and he was rising to fame and fortune , turning more successful in racing . Later on , Thorndyke (David Tomlinson) wants Herbie back, but Jim refuses and Thorndyke wishes to compete against Jim in the races, then he sabotaged Herbie before a car race so , he can vanquish . As the backdrop in the race scenes is of the Riverside International Raceway . Then, a big race was coming up and Herbie, the Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of its own undergoes the famous international car race called EL Dorado but encountering all sorts of comical obstacles along the way . Jim and Tennessee along with Thorndyke's previous assistant named Carrol Bennet (Michelle Lee) , repaired Herbie before the race . The trio are determined to win Thorndyke in the El Dorado, but he will swindle and trap to make sure that they do not win . Fortunately, the couple of pilots have a sleeve in the form of Herbie , the fantastic car , as they take the magical Wolkswagen Bug with a mind of its own as both of them compete in the notorious race and attempt to beat . So the two rogue pilots (Joe Flynn , David Tomlinson) resort to all manner of cheats , legal or otherwise, to get it and are now attempting to get them back . There is one obstacle however : Herbie . Miraculous Herbie take them for a ride and stumbles into evil hoodlums who pursue through roads and race tracks .

Herbie with the number 53 intervenes in the biggest car race and win the Grand Prize , a challenge among top competitors circle the world's most famous racing circuits and quickly slipping in the ranking. This delightful Disney comedy displays great loads of amusement , fantastic race cars , slapstick , fun , giggles , chases are great fun to watch and being pretty entertaining . It's an enjoyable movie for kids and for those who enjoy cars racing round and round and bounds and leaps carried out by Herbie . Herbie The Love Bug was a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle deluxe ragtop sedan painted in Volkswagen L87 pearl white. Under normal circumstances, the interior would be a matching white. However, Herbie's interior was painted a special non-reflective grey color so the camera and studio lights would not reflect . The actors seem to enjoy immensely , as Dean Jones and Buddy Hackett play of sympathetic manner and the mean-spirited villains performed by David Tomlinson Joe Flynn are top notch. Colorful cinematography by Edward Colman and jolly soundtrack by George Bruns including the lively leitmotif , usual in the Herbie's series. This is a delightful film , this original entry is followed by &uml; Herbie rides again (1974)&uml; also by Robert Stevenson and starred by Ken Berry , Stefanie Powers and Helen Hayes ; it's followed by &uml;Herbie goes to Montecarlo&uml; with Dean Jones , Don Knotts and Julie Sommers ; followed by &uml;Herbie goes bananas&uml; (1980 , or Herbie Torero) by Vincent McEveety starred by Charles Martin Smith and Cloris Leachman , among others and a 1997-for-television-movie with Bruce Campbell and John Hanna and a TV series , the most part filmed by Stevenson and Vincent McEveety and usually starred by Dean Jones . Furthermore recent version starred by Linsay Lohan , Justin Long and Matt Dillon , being directed by Angela Robinson. This first version " Love Bug &uml; results to be the best version , it is amusing story with lots of laughs but is a familiar film . The motion picture is correctly directed by Robert Stevenson . He's an usual craftsman from Disney productions who achieved for the famous company its greatest successes such as &uml;Mary Poppins&uml; , &uml;Bednobs and broomsticks , &uml;Gnome-mobile&uml;, &uml;Herbie rides again&uml; , &uml;Absent-minded professor&uml;, &uml;Son of Flubber&uml;, &uml;Shaggy DA&uml; , &uml;That darn cat&uml; , &uml;One of our dinosaurs is missing&uml; and many others . Rating : Acceptable , 6,5 , worthwhile watching . Amusing and engaging film with effective combination of primitive special effects , live action , adventure , fantasy and humor . The children will get a kick out of this typical Disney film ,it's a great fun to watch and there are loads of entertainment in this one . It' one of the best and funniest of &uml;Herbie&uml; series

    What tends to happen over Christmas is that often an entire series of films will be shown on a channel over consecutive days and sure enough, the BBC didn't disappoint. The fact that most people over the age of thirty will have already seen this matters not a jot as it remains a highly enjoyable slice of family fun from when Disney were at their best. Some films aren't meant to be taken seriously - in fact, I can think of plenty that aren't - but the tale of a beat-up VW Beetle with a mind of its own offers a rarely-seen mix of magic, entertainment and a chance to regress to a more innocent time, when the Sixties were in full swing and not everything was about making money. Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) is a washed-up racing driver living in San Fransisco with his eccentric friend Tennessee (Buddy Hackett). After crashing out of his latest outing, Jim walks the streets in search of inspiration. Instead, he falls head-over-heels for showroom assistant Carole (Michele Lee) who works with the dastardly Thorndyke (David Tomlinson). Jim finds himself acquiring an old Volkwagen Beetle from Thorndyke, who is happy to see the back of it, but Jim soon finds that "Herbie" seems to have a mind of its own. And when Jim's fortunes on the track improve when he begins racing in "Herbie", Thorndyke will stop at nothing to reclaim the car for his own personal gain. The plot is plainly ridiculous but once "The Love Bug" starts, it sweeps you into the most absurd adventure that it's impossible not to enjoy it. It's fun in an old-fashioned sense, little things like the slapstick oil leaks onto Thorndyke's shoes or face or the crude effects behind Herbie's unusual turn of speed. And yet, the effects don't detract from the film - this is film-making the way it used to be before CG made everything "better" (or cheaper) - nothing like the recent "Herbie: Fully Loaded" outing. The best thing is the car itself which is full of life and personality without the need to slap a face on it. It rattles and rolls as if it truly is alive - a marvellous effort that has to be admired. If anything, he's much more interesting and entertaining than the human cast although Hackett's bizarre performance is worth a mention and Tomlinson also does well as Thorndyke, who's a mere moustache-twiddle away from being Dick Dastardly or Terry Thomas. "The Love Bug" is obviously very dated and very much a product of its time - the drive-in diner scene with the two hippies reinforced that quite clearly - but this remains an enjoyable and delightfully daft family film to entertain kids of all ages. My wife, who was chuckling throughout, is typical of a viewer who, despite having seen it before, still found the time to enjoy it anew with this viewer who watched it for the first time. Not many films aimed at kids last as long as this and the fact that people still speak of this movie with fond memories speaks volumes. Grab your leathers and enjoy this petrol-headed piece of motoring joy.

The Love bug is the story of a man who meets an extraordinary car and how said car changes his life. This movie has a bit of everything, comedy, appeal to kids, romance, racing, Disney villains who are as likable as they are bad. One of the essential to watch Disney movies in my humble opinion. The background music really went to support the film. The footage wasn't always best shots but hey it was the 60s and I think it helps keep the feel of that era looking like that. Overall this movie is the reason that people know who Herbie is today and the reason he has become as iconic as many of their cartoon characters.

    Before "Knight Rider" or "Speed Buggy",there was Herbie. This spunky Volkswagon can win a race whenever he can! Hardly anyone can control this machinery, he tends to think on its own. Here you have a racer named Jim Douglas(Dean Jones), a racer who lives for the thrill. Known for wrecking cars, he gets a chance to go on the racing field once again. He and his partner Tennessee Steimetz(Buddy Hackett) get the car and the fun begins. Both he and Herbie get the glory, but the owner of foreign cars has other plans. He wanted to get Herbie out of action, permanently! Carole Bennett(Michele Lee)decides to join forces with Jim and Tennessee, and make sure that Peter Thorndyke(David Tomlinson) don't get all the glory. There was a lot of humor in the race when the bear took the saboteur's place when trying to keep Herbie from winning. And who needed a chauffeur when you have Herbie doing the driving. A great movie, family friendly, and true gem that can make you sparkle. For all you grease-monkeys, here's a movie for you! Also it was my nickname. HAHAHA!!! 5 STARS!

Herbie The Love Bug was a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle deluxe ragtop sedan painted in Volkswagen L87 pearl white. Under normal circumstances, the interior would be a matching white. However, Herbie's interior was painted a special non-reflective grey color so the camera and studio lights would not reflect . The actors seem to enjoy immensely , as Dean Jones and Buddy Hackett play of sympathetic manner and the mean-spirited villains performed by David Tomlinson Joe Flynn are top notch. Colorful cinematography by Edward Colman and jolly soundtrack by George Bruns including the lively leitmotif , usual in the Herbie's series.

    What tends to happen over Christmas is that often an entire series of films will be shown on a channel over consecutive days and sure enough, the BBC didn't disappoint. The fact that most people over the age of thirty will have already seen this matters not a jot as it remains a highly enjoyable slice of family fun from when Disney were at their best. Some films aren't meant to be taken seriously - in fact, I can think of plenty that aren't - but the tale of a beat-up VW Beetle with a mind of its own offers a rarely-seen mix of magic, entertainment and a chance to regress to a more innocent time, when the Sixties were in full swing and not everything was about making money. Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) is a washed-up racing driver living in San Fransisco with his eccentric friend Tennessee (Buddy Hackett). After crashing out of his latest outing, Jim walks the streets in search of inspiration. Instead, he falls head-over-heels for showroom assistant Carole (Michele Lee) who works with the dastardly Thorndyke (David Tomlinson). Jim finds himself acquiring an old Volkwagen Beetle from Thorndyke, who is happy to see the back of it, but Jim soon finds that "Herbie" seems to have a mind of its own. And when Jim's fortunes on the track improve when he begins racing in "Herbie", Thorndyke will stop at nothing to reclaim the car for his own personal gain. The plot is plainly ridiculous but once "The Love Bug" starts, it sweeps you into the most absurd adventure that it's impossible not to enjoy it. It's fun in an old-fashioned sense, little things like the slapstick oil leaks onto Thorndyke's shoes or face or the crude effects behind Herbie's unusual turn of speed. And yet, the effects don't detract from the film - this is film-making the way it used to be before CG made everything "better" (or cheaper) - nothing like the recent "Herbie: Fully Loaded" outing. The best thing is the car itself which is full of life and personality without the need to slap a face on it. It rattles and rolls as if it truly is alive - a marvellous effort that has to be admired. If anything, he's much more interesting and entertaining than the human cast although Hackett's bizarre performance is worth a mention and Tomlinson also does well as Thorndyke, who's a mere moustache-twiddle away from being Dick Dastardly or Terry Thomas. "The Love Bug" is obviously very dated and very much a product of its time - the drive-in diner scene with the two hippies reinforced that quite clearly - but this remains an enjoyable and delightfully daft family film to entertain kids of all ages. My wife, who was chuckling throughout, is typical of a viewer who, despite having seen it before, still found the time to enjoy it anew with this viewer who watched it for the first time. Not many films aimed at kids last as long as this and the fact that people still speak of this movie with fond memories speaks volumes. Grab your leathers and enjoy this petrol-headed piece of motoring joy.

    Disney gives no death or injury count for the opening credits, but San Francisco race-car driver Dean Jones (as Jim Douglas) emerges with only a scratch. Totally wiped-out and looking for a new car, Mr. Jones is attracted to the legs of mini-skirted Michele Lee (as Carole Bennett). She works for car dealer and racing rival David Tomlinson (as Peter Thorndike), who treats a shiny white 1963 Volkswagen Beetle badly. Jones defends the VW and the car literally follows him home. It tries to match him up with Ms. Lee, after the two don't hit it off as expected. Jones' Buddhist mechanic Buddy Hackett (as Tennessee Steinmetz) names the car "Herbie" after his uncle. Jones takes the car on the racing circuit, ending in a big finish. This occasionally idiotic but often amusing film made driving in a VW more fun. "Herbie" and the setting make it hum. ****** The Love Bug (12/24/68) Robert Stevenson ~ Dean Jones, Michele Lee, Buddy Hackett, David Tomlinson

    Man meets car, romance ensues. It was one of my favorites when I was younger, especially Buddy Hackett, who makes the movie, as far as I'm concerned. The special effects were great, and the supporting characters (David Tomlinson, especially), make it re-watchable. I remember vividly how VWs took off like crazy after this movie came out. Since one of my aunts had a VW Bug AND looked almost exactly like Michelle Lee, I used to love going to visit her. I always expected the car to split in half or do a wheelie. The one thing that has always bugged me about the movie is how they NEVER call it a Volkswagen - always "the little car" or something.

    I had seen the modern Lindsay Lohan/Michael Keaton remake of the classic collection of films about the living car, Herbie: Fully Loaded, and it was right I should see the first of the old ones, from director Robert Stevenson (Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks). Basically down on his luck racing car driver Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) and his friend, occasionally drunk mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz (The Little Mermaid's Buddy Hackett), live together in an old run down fire house. One day Jim goes to a luxury car dealership and wants something in a rather low price range, but mean dealer Peter Thorndyke (Mary Poppins' David Tomlinson) has no interest in helping him. Then Jim spots a strange car, an old Vauxwagen Beetle, and after managing to take it away with him, it proves to be an unusual car, it has a mind of its own driving where it wants to. He believes Thorndyke planted the car on purpose, but dealer assistant Carole Bennett (Michele Lee) proves the car is a good purchase, only to discover the car is living as well, and Jim has found a love interest. After being fixed up Jim, and given the name "Herbie" by Tennessee, the car is more controlled by its driver, and with a high speed they start racing to be champions, against Thorndyke, who wants the car back. After Thorndyke sabotages one race to win, the big race called the "El Dorado" is on the way, and there is a point when you wonder if Herbie will go to it, but after the apologies, he does. So the two lap gets started, with Thorndyke seeming to cheat his way to the lead, but Jim, Carole and Tennessee in Herbie manage to catch up and eventually win the race. Also starring Joe Flynn as Havershaw, Benson Fong as Mr. Wu, Andy Granatelli as Association President and Joe E. Ross as Detective. The car doesn't have as much personality as perhaps the remake version does, Tomlinson makes a reasonably mean villain, like a live version Dick Dastardly, and the jokes are alright, it is something the family will enjoy, an alright comedy. It was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!

    I was surprised at how much I enjoyed The Love Bug. It is such good fun, and I do agree that it is by far and away the best movie of the series. The story is simple but well structured and interesting and the dialogue has its fair share of very funny and somewhat poignant moments. The photography is nice to look at, the direction is on target, the pacing is snappy and the soundtrack is lovely. The entire cast from Buddy Hackett, Dean Jones, Joe Flynn and Michelle Lee is very strong, but at the end of the day Herbie is the one who steals the show, quite cute and endearing for a car Herbie is. All in all, while not the best of the live-action Disney movies being a touch too long, it is thoroughly enjoyable and I can see completely why people love it. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    What to say about this movie its so good and well made its so amazing Disney put more time on this movie then he did with any other Herbie films this one has to be the best in the series its my favorite Herbie movie they put this movie on car who has a mind of its own and I really like Volkswagens and this one has a name he's name Herbie with love in the air and happens in is heart its very funny and fun and it looks so realist. I don't care how many people say how cheesy it is its a amazing Herbie you showed every one love and care you are very fast car you should really get 7.3 out of 10. I now what I am thinking this movie should be rated a 7.3 out of 10 for its true rating who ever rated a 6.3 out of 10 for this movie should be shot its the best in series and by for to be own DVD I have got it on DVD I have not seen it on DVD at the shops for couples time maybe its such a good movie. OK here are some changes I want to see on the rating for this movie I want to see a 7.3 out of 10 for its true rating OK thats good for me and for my rating I give this movie a 10 out of 10. very good this movie brought back one of my childhood.

    What originally started out as an idea suggested to Walt Disney by 'stock' actor Dean Jones about the first European sports car to come to America, ended up being swept into one of Disney's most lovable and most memorable characters, Herbie. The 1963 VW who has a mind and heart of HIS own. Although Walt Disney had started a basis about a car-type movie, screenwriter Gordon Bufford came in a wrote a screenplay called 'Thunderbug' which later changes to many numerous other titles such as 'Car-Boy-Girl' and the idiotic 'Magic Volksy'. What resulted was 'The Love Bug'. Jim Douglas is a well known track car racer who is real big on doing demolition derby-type races. He lives in an old firehouse with a mechanic friend of his named Tennessee (Buddy Hackett). The two of them have a strong feeling for cars and have literally turned their home into a garage over piled with car parts and tools. One day, everything changes when Jim stumbles upon a white 1963 VW who has a mind of its own. Jim and Tennessee end up getting involved with this strange little car and notice its not LIKE ANY OTHERS. Jim realizes that this car would dominate racing tracks across the country (Tennessee names the car Herbie). Jim Douglas and his car become quite famous on the race track and build up competition with an auto dealer who drives the most fast cars equipped for racing. I can't really explain the plot too well, so I suggest you just see it for yourself. The bottom line is that Herbie has a heart and mind of his own and can control himself when he wants too. This movie and its sequels are really good (although I can't really say the same for Herbie:Fully Loaded though). These movies will make you laugh and you'll have a fun time watching them, as usual with most older Disney movies. This movie is a perfect model as to what older Disney films were about. Most starred adults and were really cool and fun to watch. Now Disney seems to be designing garbage for sex predators. Every movie is with girls in tight clothes and young dating and each kid has one parent, and they play soccer, plus fart jokes and some sort of talking animal. Pixar's films are good, but anything released outside of that is CRAP 99.5% of the time. That's because Disney is no longer a person, its a name, a product used up to get some CEO his 9.6 million dollar mansion in the Hamptons or wherever. The original essence of Disney has been lost. Now I know Disney was meant for kids, but don't take it literally by having kids as the actual stars !
