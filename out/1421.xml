    I was very disappointed with this movie. Based on the summary outline, I thought I would see somewhat of a gangsta story with some plot and redeeming features. Unfortunately all this movie provided me was a very slow moving story of various machismo gangsta's being shot off one by one and then the scene would shift and we would be left watching another one of the gangsta's funerals. There was a memorium at the end of the movie so I assume the story may be (loosely) based on a real life person(s) but the story telling that was narrated by one of the primary characters was very boring and the acting below par. Look for bit parts from actors Salma Hayek and Danny Trejo before they were well known stars with a list of movie credits behind them. As for the main stars in this film, just like some of the gangsta's in this movie who were killed off, I guess their portrayal of a mob girl was just a bit too (un)real and so their movie careers died. Go figure.

    Excellent movie. This is the birth of hood-rats and the choices to make. "Why you gotta be like this?" Really? That's the guy and life you want to follow? It's sad cases that you can see happens in real life as well. Visions of hope and the tragedy mixed in you can see coming a mile away. They think they're the "baddest" girls around, they fight each other, their boyfriends, rivals and just life in general. It's another world that lives beneath, the urban lifestyle trapping the girls in a place that most people would never want to live in.

    Mostpeople would say that this movie is the best of the worst movies. I haven't seen another film about girls in gangs like this one. I think this movie, even though times and trends changed a little bit for cholitas, is a great at portraying what life for them back then- was like. For shur, they should definitely come out with a movie based on one of my favorite books- LAdy Q.- This is getting off topic- but a lot of scenes in this movie remind me of Piotrowski Park in my city. I cant stand the oldies look in this movie at all- or the black lipstick- but thats how they used to look in the 90's. sad. I also cant stand the fact that these 2 girls (mousie and sad girl, are fightin over a loser who is playing both of them and hes a dumbass!

    As Echo Park becomes a gentrified suburb, you'll see more and more movies reflecting the middle class hipster culture that's taking over the neighborhood. Mi Vida Loca is the best glimpse a lay person will ever get into the pre-gentrification Echo Park. This is Los Angeles, shortly after the Rodney King riots. Mousie (Seidy Lopez, "Resurrection Blvd") and Sad Girl (Angel Aviles, "Desperado"), two lifelong friends, and members of the Echo Parque Locas gang, each have a kid by the same guy, drug dealer and Echo Parque gang member Ernesto (Jacob Vargas, "Selena", "Road Dogz"). A death in their tight knit circle changes everything, including many preexisting grudges. But a real wild card gets thrown into their hand when a homegirl, "Giggles" (Marlo Marron, "My Funny Valentine"), is released from prison, and tries to steer the homegirls away from the street life, and into a life in "COMPUUUUTERS!!!". Her very astute warning of what the future will be like, likely learned while reading in prison, falls on deaf ears, but her independent, entrepreneurial spirit does not, as she leads the homegirls through a plan to get the best out of a pickup truck in which the ownership thereof is in dispute, not only within the Echo Park gang, but also with a member of the rival River Valley gang, El Duran (Jesse Borrego, "Bound By Honor: Blood In Blood Out"). A correspondence between a beautiful yet reclusive younger sister of Sad Girl, La Blue Eyes (Magali Alvarado), who's "trip" is getting an education and avoiding the gang life, and a "torcedo" (guest of the California prison system), eventually puts La Blue Eyes front and center of the tragic climax of these intertwining stories.

    When NPR did a series of stories on gangs in Los Angeles, I remembered that I'd been meaning to see this film and found it streaming online. It was pretty disappointing, but not a complete waste of time. I'm not an expert on gangs, but I believe the other reviewer may be correct that this film is relatively realistic, and at the same time, it is not excessively graphic for a gang movie, focusing on various lives in the neighborhood. The worst part was definitely the acting. Some of the writing was painful too, but there were a few outstanding scenes. My favorite bit was a monologue (I think by Ernesto?) about the different feelings he gets (disgust, superiority, sexual arousal) from selling drugs to desperate whites. Certain characters like Blue Eyes and Puppet were also interesting, but otherwise the story was pretty weak. There was an interesting attempt at carrying a feminist message but it didn't really work for me. If anyone knows of a better film about Chicano gangs, let me know.

    Mi Vida Loca (1993) was another film released during the brief Latino film craze in Hollywood during the early 90's. The stories were not that entertaining on one hand, but if you're into overacted schlock then you'll have a field day with this film. I have grown up around these type of people. Some of the things in this film are a bit authentic but for the most part it's filled with glaring stereotypes and flat out bad acting. But I am so hating on Jesse Borrego's character El Duran (he's a very underrated actor in my humble opinion). El Duran rolls around in a bad ride, dresses like a pimp and has a hot Salma Hayek riding shotgun. Is this movie worth watching. No, but if you like cheesy films like Blood in Blood Out.., you'll enjoy this flick. Mousey was real cute, very feminine unlike most of the cast. Cheers. Not recommended. D

    i loved this movie. It shows the life and struggles of young Hispanics growing up in the hood. With this even if it is not acted out to the best of other actors abilities, these actors are real. They may not know how to act very well, but they are true to the character. It shows that no matter how you begin your life you always have a choice and depending on the choice you make it can change your life forever. From gangs to drugs and even guns this movie takes you in the life of some harsh realities. With the good the bad and the babies they do the best they can with what they have. Survival is everything. Similar movies to see are Blood In Blod Out Bond By Honor, American Me, and raising Victor Vargas. These movies also focus on the ups and downs of gangster life.

    I'm a newcomer to USA, having been here for less than 2 years. But I live in LA and not too far from where Echo Park is. My first exposure to the gangs was through Los Angeles Times; but later when I started tutoring a kid, I started learning lots of things about the gang culture. (No, the kid does not belong to any gang. To make sure that he won't, his parents enrolled him in Taek Won Do, Tennis and many other such things). For example, earlier I never knew that seemingly innocent graffiti on the walls signify gang territory, or that a bandanna of a certain color, or even a pair of Nike shoes of a certain make implies on'es affiliation to a particular gang. Similarly, a shoe hanging from a telephone wire conveys a message...and that as a kid, this kid was offered gang membership in his school from some of his classmates. I watched Mi Vida Loca with interest because of such background information I have. And to me, as an outsider, the movie seems to depict reality. Now, though my opinion in this matter perhaps does not make much difference, testimonials/reviews from people, who were themselves involved with gangs earlier, make me feel that this movie does indeed depict reality of the mean streets. It's obvious that some of he actors are not professionals, but who cares! In addition to the main actors, Bertila Damas (Rachel)'s face is so dignified, and she carries herself with so much grace that one almost forgets that she's depicting an ex gang-banger.Similarly, Nelida Lopez (Whisper) looks really so fresh and innocent that she instantly wins hearts. In my opinion, irrespective of what critics say about the movie,the kind of emotions this movie seems to have generated from the ex gang-members (read their reviews here) proves that this movie has succeeded in doing what it perhaps intended to do: to open people's eyes towards the harsh reality of gang life. And I think, that alone proves the worth of this movie.

    Well let's see...I saw this movie when I was about twelve years old and thought it was pretty good considering it was a low budget film, and I still do give credit to the makers of it for that aspect. However I am afraid to say that being grown up and realizing that gangs are anything but cool and that two women getting pregnant by the same man and fighting for him, is by far what defines Mexican culture. Therefore I am going to have to give this movie two thumbs down. The movie does nothing but show the negative aspects of ghetto life and places Hispanic faces to portray it. Main characters Mousie and Sad Girl never change throughout the movie. In fact almost all the characters are pretty one-dimensional and have no revelation or turn-around whatsoever. The only character to change was Giggles when she decides to get a job with computers but the other girls look at her as if they don't know the meaning of the word. They think she's weird for wanting to better herself so instead they sit around at home, don't go to school, deal drugs and bring their children around the other gang members. There's even an irrelevant part where Sad Girl is "tripping out" because she only has two food stamps left. Little lines like that that have no meaning or relevance to the progression of the story make me cease to wonder why Hollywood insists on making Hispanics be portrayed so poorly. To the makers of this movie...Shame on you.

    This movie portraying the life of cholas and cholos (gangsta chicks/vatos)living in the hood of Echo parke!) The movie has some good potential to the raw image of the street life. it portrays gang members being jumped by fellow members to be in their gang. It has very poor acting and often shifts the story and doesnt focus too much on one subject. This movie could of had more potential in the box office if it had been casted alot better. These are first time actors who need to get some more acting skills. Thats partly why I thought it was a bit humorous in some parts. I mean one of the hoods didnt know how to deal drugs or return a page. i mean common they aint that stupid ih the hood. SO it was a bit funny (guilty pleasure) Knowing that these are all studio gangstas.

They think they're the "baddest" girls around, they fight each other, their boyfriends, rivals and just life in general. It's another world that lives beneath, the urban lifestyle trapping the girls in a place that most people would never want to live in.

    Mostpeople would say that this movie is the best of the worst movies. I haven't seen another film about girls in gangs like this one. I think this movie, even though times and trends changed a little bit for cholitas, is a great at portraying what life for them back then- was like. For shur, they should definitely come out with a movie based on one of my favorite books- LAdy Q.- This is getting off topic- but a lot of scenes in this movie remind me of Piotrowski Park in my city. I cant stand the oldies look in this movie at all- or the black lipstick- but thats how they used to look in the 90's. sad. I also cant stand the fact that these 2 girls (mousie and sad girl, are fightin over a loser who is playing both of them and hes a dumbass!

    As Echo Park becomes a gentrified suburb, you'll see more and more movies reflecting the middle class hipster culture that's taking over the neighborhood. Mi Vida Loca is the best glimpse a lay person will ever get into the pre-gentrification Echo Park. This is Los Angeles, shortly after the Rodney King riots. Mousie (Seidy Lopez, "Resurrection Blvd") and Sad Girl (Angel Aviles, "Desperado"), two lifelong friends, and members of the Echo Parque Locas gang, each have a kid by the same guy, drug dealer and Echo Parque gang member Ernesto (Jacob Vargas, "Selena", "Road Dogz"). A death in their tight knit circle changes everything, including many preexisting grudges. But a real wild card gets thrown into their hand when a homegirl, "Giggles" (Marlo Marron, "My Funny Valentine"), is released from prison, and tries to steer the homegirls away from the street life, and into a life in "COMPUUUUTERS!!!". Her very astute warning of what the future will be like, likely learned while reading in prison, falls on deaf ears, but her independent, entrepreneurial spirit does not, as she leads the homegirls through a plan to get the best out of a pickup truck in which the ownership thereof is in dispute, not only within the Echo Park gang, but also with a member of the rival River Valley gang, El Duran (Jesse Borrego, "Bound By Honor: Blood In Blood Out"). A correspondence between a beautiful yet reclusive younger sister of Sad Girl, La Blue Eyes (Magali Alvarado), who's "trip" is getting an education and avoiding the gang life, and a "torcedo" (guest of the California prison system), eventually puts La Blue Eyes front and center of the tragic climax of these intertwining stories.

    When NPR did a series of stories on gangs in Los Angeles, I remembered that I'd been meaning to see this film and found it streaming online. It was pretty disappointing, but not a complete waste of time. I'm not an expert on gangs, but I believe the other reviewer may be correct that this film is relatively realistic, and at the same time, it is not excessively graphic for a gang movie, focusing on various lives in the neighborhood. The worst part was definitely the acting. Some of the writing was painful too, but there were a few outstanding scenes. My favorite bit was a monologue (I think by Ernesto?) about the different feelings he gets (disgust, superiority, sexual arousal) from selling drugs to desperate whites. Certain characters like Blue Eyes and Puppet were also interesting, but otherwise the story was pretty weak. There was an interesting attempt at carrying a feminist message but it didn't really work for me. If anyone knows of a better film about Chicano gangs, let me know.

    Mi Vida Loca (1993) was another film released during the brief Latino film craze in Hollywood during the early 90's. The stories were not that entertaining on one hand, but if you're into overacted schlock then you'll have a field day with this film. I have grown up around these type of people. Some of the things in this film are a bit authentic but for the most part it's filled with glaring stereotypes and flat out bad acting. But I am so hating on Jesse Borrego's character El Duran (he's a very underrated actor in my humble opinion). El Duran rolls around in a bad ride, dresses like a pimp and has a hot Salma Hayek riding shotgun. Is this movie worth watching. No, but if you like cheesy films like Blood in Blood Out.., you'll enjoy this flick. Mousey was real cute, very feminine unlike most of the cast. Cheers. Not recommended. D

    i loved this movie. It shows the life and struggles of young Hispanics growing up in the hood. With this even if it is not acted out to the best of other actors abilities, these actors are real. They may not know how to act very well, but they are true to the character. It shows that no matter how you begin your life you always have a choice and depending on the choice you make it can change your life forever. From gangs to drugs and even guns this movie takes you in the life of some harsh realities. With the good the bad and the babies they do the best they can with what they have. Survival is everything. Similar movies to see are Blood In Blod Out Bond By Honor, American Me, and raising Victor Vargas. These movies also focus on the ups and downs of gangster life.

    I'm a newcomer to USA, having been here for less than 2 years. But I live in LA and not too far from where Echo Park is. My first exposure to the gangs was through Los Angeles Times; but later when I started tutoring a kid, I started learning lots of things about the gang culture. (No, the kid does not belong to any gang. To make sure that he won't, his parents enrolled him in Taek Won Do, Tennis and many other such things). For example, earlier I never knew that seemingly innocent graffiti on the walls signify gang territory, or that a bandanna of a certain color, or even a pair of Nike shoes of a certain make implies on'es affiliation to a particular gang. Similarly, a shoe hanging from a telephone wire conveys a message...and that as a kid, this kid was offered gang membership in his school from some of his classmates. I watched Mi Vida Loca with interest because of such background information I have. And to me, as an outsider, the movie seems to depict reality. Now, though my opinion in this matter perhaps does not make much difference, testimonials/reviews from people, who were themselves involved with gangs earlier, make me feel that this movie does indeed depict reality of the mean streets. It's obvious that some of he actors are not professionals, but who cares! In addition to the main actors, Bertila Damas (Rachel)'s face is so dignified, and she carries herself with so much grace that one almost forgets that she's depicting an ex gang-banger.Similarly, Nelida Lopez (Whisper) looks really so fresh and innocent that she instantly wins hearts. In my opinion, irrespective of what critics say about the movie,the kind of emotions this movie seems to have generated from the ex gang-members (read their reviews here) proves that this movie has succeeded in doing what it perhaps intended to do: to open people's eyes towards the harsh reality of gang life. And I think, that alone proves the worth of this movie.

    Well let's see...I saw this movie when I was about twelve years old and thought it was pretty good considering it was a low budget film, and I still do give credit to the makers of it for that aspect. However I am afraid to say that being grown up and realizing that gangs are anything but cool and that two women getting pregnant by the same man and fighting for him, is by far what defines Mexican culture. Therefore I am going to have to give this movie two thumbs down. The movie does nothing but show the negative aspects of ghetto life and places Hispanic faces to portray it. Main characters Mousie and Sad Girl never change throughout the movie. In fact almost all the characters are pretty one-dimensional and have no revelation or turn-around whatsoever. The only character to change was Giggles when she decides to get a job with computers but the other girls look at her as if they don't know the meaning of the word. They think she's weird for wanting to better herself so instead they sit around at home, don't go to school, deal drugs and bring their children around the other gang members. There's even an irrelevant part where Sad Girl is "tripping out" because she only has two food stamps left. Little lines like that that have no meaning or relevance to the progression of the story make me cease to wonder why Hollywood insists on making Hispanics be portrayed so poorly. To the makers of this movie...Shame on you.

    This movie portraying the life of cholas and cholos (gangsta chicks/vatos)living in the hood of Echo parke!) The movie has some good potential to the raw image of the street life. it portrays gang members being jumped by fellow members to be in their gang. It has very poor acting and often shifts the story and doesnt focus too much on one subject. This movie could of had more potential in the box office if it had been casted alot better. These are first time actors who need to get some more acting skills. Thats partly why I thought it was a bit humorous in some parts. I mean one of the hoods didnt know how to deal drugs or return a page. i mean common they aint that stupid ih the hood. SO it was a bit funny (guilty pleasure) Knowing that these are all studio gangstas.
