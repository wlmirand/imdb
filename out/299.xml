    Director Bill Duke is attempting a grand gangster movie, but really don't have the skills of a master filmmaker to pull it off. The pace is ponderous. And even the action is unenergetic. Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) is a gang leader of 1930's Harlem whose successful 'Numbers' racket attracts ruthless Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) from downtown. Meanwhile gangland boss Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia) try to negotiate his way in. Bumpy refuses to give in, and violence ensues. There are a lot of great actors, but there are also some distracting overacting. Laurence Fishburne is great, and Tim Roth is wonderful as a bad guy. But I wouldn't recommend this even with these great actors.

    People who have seen American Gangster or are regular viewers of the TV show, Mobsters, will know who Bumpy Johnson was and know the story behind Hoodlum. For those of you who don't, Johnson was a member of an organized crime group, in Harlem, during the 1930's. He was also the man who mentored and inspired Denzel Washington's character of Frank Lucas in American Gangster. Long before that film, the story of Bumpy Johnson was told in Hoodlum. This was one of those little told stories about the mafia that started out very strong. Unfortunately, I felt that the writers went into far too much detail at certain points in the film and by the end it was definitely dragging on. Laurence Fishburne stars as Johnson and did an adequate job, my problem with his has always been he lacks emotion in his acting. In my humble opinion this should automatically disqualify him from certain things and this probably should have been one of those things. Tim Roth is Dutch Schultz and while Schultz had a reputation for being a character, Roth went a little over the top with it, but was still very entertaining. My favorite performance was of course the one by Andy Garcia as Lucky Luciano, but he really wasn't in the film much and that's a shame, because nobody plays a crime boss better than hen does. Hoodlum is a wild ride about an incredible true story, but as a film, it was a mix of terrific scenes and some slower unnecessary elements. As a film it's not the best, but it's worth watching just for the amazing story that is being told.

    This is a movie set in the 1930's in Harlem. It is the height of the depression and a Negro, Bumpy Johnson, has just been released from gaol. He returns to find that the Queen's gambling racket is being threatened by a white man from downtown. Everybody in Harlem is happy with the way things are - people play the numbers game and win enough to put food on the table. But numbers is a very big business and the mafia wants a piece of it. The mafia boss of the time, Lucky Lucino, is content to let it go, but one of his underlings wants a piece of the action and soon a gang war breaks out. This is the typical inter-war style movie with corrupt cops and politicians and crime running rife. The prohibition years are over, but people are making money now by other rackets, and the American system of brutal monopoly is leaving blood on the streets and the corrupt politicians are supporting those who have the most money. It is a time of lawlessness and strife, and in a way we should feel glad we don't live there. Another thing about the time is that the Negro is still very much in the underclass and there is a lot of prejudice and tension between the races. The major theme here is how power corrupts. The Queen is taken to gaol and she gives Bumpy the business to run. Bumpy is a very intelligent man, but he is also very stubborn. He refuses to give into the non-Negros and will continue to fight until one is dead. Unfortunately his stubbornness brings about the death of many innocent people. During this time, his girlfriend walks out on him, and his cousin begins to disown him, yet he refuses to give in because he believes he is right. This movie really looks at the tragedy of this, but it is not that tragic because Bumpy soon sees how he has changed and will begin to change before it is too late. But then with the death of his cousin, one can argue it is too late. His girlfriend has left, and chastises him for being so stubborn that he refuses to step into a church to pay respects for one of the dead. He finally steps into a church to pay respect to his cousin, and then walks straight out. As such we see the beginning of a change, but we don't follow through with it. The problems have been solved, and Harlem has its autonomy - what happens to Bumpy in the future is for the future.

    Interesting film about the rise of Ellsworth "Bumpy" Morgan portrayed by Lauwrence Fishburn and the fall of "Dutch" Schultz portrayed by Tim Roth. My preference goes to the Dustin Hoffman version of "Dutch" Schultz in the more accurate rendering featured in "Billy Bathgate". "Hoodlum" falls short when they showcase Dutch being hit by his own henchman in the restaurant bathroom while in "Billy Bathgate" they get it historically right as Dutch's gang (five men) are wiped out in the restaurant by "Lucky" Luciano's gang. Hoodlum may fall short on accuracy but keeps the viewer on their toes as to what happens next. Probably one of the most accurate films I have ever seen was Rod Stieger's performance in "Al Capone".

    Snap-brim fedoras, vintage autos, blazing Tommy guns, corrupt public officials and greedy mobsters battling it out over turf rights recur throughout director Bill Duke's violent, 1930s' racketeering epic "Hoodlum," a pictorially authentic actioneer that evokes memories of the classic Robert Stack television series "The Untouchables." Although "Hoodlum" boasts a top-drawer cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Vanessa Williams, Tim Roth, and Andy Garcia, this lavishly mounted but uneven gangster saga suffers from its rambling length, garrulous script and a shortage of shoot-outs. As the first major film to headline the crimes of Harlem's infamous Black Godfather Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson, this production offers a novel departure for audiences that are weary of superheroes, female warriors and hard-bitten cops who have were crowding the big-screen when "Hoodlum" appeared in 1997. The Chris Brancato screenplay introduces Bumpy in 1934 as he exits Sing Sing Prison. Duke and Brancato exert great pains to differentiate Bumpy from the typical African-American mobster. He peruses books, plays chess, and pens poetry. As literate as Bumpy is, he can pull a trigger or wield a knife without a pang of remorse when somebody threatens a person who he loves. Like "The Godfather II" and "Once Upon A Time in America," "Hoodlum" charts the rise of the Godfather of Harlem in a ruthless game of survival that claims his best friend Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride of "I, Robot") and leaves Bumpy forever altered by the gory experience. Ostensibly, you won't see anything in "Hoodlum" that you haven't seen in dozens of other crime films. "Hoodlum" features notorious real-life racketeers such as Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth of "Pulp Fiction") and Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia of "Godfather III") as well as corrupt special prosecutor Thomas Dewey (William Atherton of "The Sugarland Express). When Bumpy arrives in Harlem, he watches a numbers runner working for Madam Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson) who is the so-called 'Queen of the Numbers.' The Dutchman craves to absorb the territory that the Madam has struggled for a decade to build into the number one home-grown Harlem business. Bumpy vows to prevent any takeover by the Irish mob. Meanwhile, the boorish, grubby, low-life Schultz refuses to appease Lucky or Bumpy. Along the way, Bumpy falls in love with righteous Francine (Vanessa Williams) who wants him to find respectable work. Bumpy refuses to stoop to menial employment. When Dutch cannot kill the Madam, he bribes a judge to send her to the pen. Bumpy supervises the Madam's empire at her request during her absence. Bumpy's bloodthirsty methods clash with her live-and-let-live notions. Eventually, Luciano and Bumpy strike a deal, and Dutch finds himself out in the cold. Suddenly, gangster gunfire chops down a young, innocent numbers runner. Now, Bumpy's cronies think that he has gone too far. Francine bails out on him more out of the formulaic dictates of the story than for any motivated reason. So do the filmmakers. The second half of the movie shows Bumpy losing favor with everybody. The film's publicity notes claim that "Hoodlum" is complete fiction, but historical characters populate the story. Of course, movies rarely recreate history with any fidelity. History is more chaotic than dramatic, so filmmakers recast it to fit their dramatic formulas. One way is by cutting the number of characters. Refusing to portray these events as they actually occurred, Duke and Brancato blow a fantastic opportunity to exploit their melodramatic potential. Duke, whose directorial credits include "Deep Cover" and "A Rage in Harlem," wrestles with the obvious lapses in Brancato's script. The length of "Hoodlum" may have been cut by the studio to squeeze in more showings in a single evening. The action grows and takes on an episodic quality when Bumpy becomes callous. After the first half, the film's momentum bogs down, and "Hoodlum" loses its air of fun. The time has come for the characters to pay the piper. The filmmakers embrace a curious morality. In most gangster movies, the hoodlum hero must die. Bumpy gets off easy, as does Luciano and only Dutch antes up with his life. Duke and Brancato allow their criminals greater leniency. The gangsters are less cancerous than the defenders of justice. Consequently, "Hoodlum" concludes on an anti-climax. Moreover, the filmmakers neglect to post an epilogue about Bumpy's outcome. For the record, the gangster who hires Shaft to find his kidnapped daughter in "Shaft" is a variation on Bumpy" as is the kingpin mobster in "American Gangster" with Denzel Washington. The problem with Brancato's script is its uneven quality. The action-packed first half is more entertaining than the tedious, long-winded second half. The filmmakers glorify Bumpy initially as a Robin Hood gangster who steals from a rival mob and gives to Harlem's starving citizens. Fishburne is riveting as a tough-as-nails but warm-hearted criminal. Roth takes top acting honors, however, as Dutch Schultz and looks like he had a ball exaggerating those vile elements in Schultz's psychotic behavior. Garcia epitomizes sartorial urbanity as the peace-making Italian gangster who divides his time between Bumpy, Dutch, and special prosecutor Dewey. Atherton's egotistical special prosecutor bristles with revulsion in his dealings with these crooks, but accepts their bribes. The filmmakers make the repressive Dewey appear particularly loathsome, a Judas whose contempt for the mob is exceeded only by his mockery of justice. Despite some flavorful dialogue, "Hoodlum" plays it straight down the line as a dramatic shoot'em up. Audiences expecting a variation on Eddie Murphy's "Harlem Nights" may leave this Fishburne film disappointed. Although it's no "Godfather," "Hoodlum" is definitely above-average and far beyond those 1970s camp classics that headlined Fred Williamson as the black Caesar of crime in "Hell Up in Harlem." If you enjoy gangster epics, "Hoodlum" is worth the price of admission. Some critics have savaged "Hoodlum" for its debatable morality. Ironically, Bumpy rises to the summit of his profession. At fade-out, however, Duke and Brancato show that the gangster's life is one that leaves you standing alone in the rain outside the church door without a friend.

    You people are nuts! This is just atrocious film wrecking. The script reminded me of a mad libs where instead of a noun, they just wrote curse words and racial slurs. It felt like the creators were aiming at entertaining the homeless insane demographic instead of intelligent individuals who wouldn't see straight through this malarky. But I have a story with this film that made it worth seeing. There was 7 people in the theater when we stumbled into this car wreck of a movie, my three friends, two other guys a few seats down and an African American couple in front of us. I was so offended by this film's utter lack of cohesive character plot, goals and motivations, creativity, etc., that my friends and I debated with the strangers next to us in the theater whether we should just leave and play area 51, a game we loathed! I was actually worried that because I was white, maybe the couple in front of us would think we were a bunch of racist jerks for leaving half way through, because it seemed to be really pretending that it was a powerful Black statement. Then the AA couple started laughing every time Larry Fishbourne said "N***** pennies" and we stayed. Two thirds in, all 7 of us turned it into a MST3K episode. We were laughing at every other line, inserting show tunes at inappropriate moments and would loudly boo and call the actors names any time the pennies were mentioned. I never would have done this had the AA dude not started throwing Junior Mints at the screen. All in all, terribly wooden acting, eerily clean set design for the 30's, bizarre and frustratingly convoluted plot and lame ass action. But hilarious theater experience.

    Bill Duke has made some great movies like Sister Act 2, Deep Cover, A Rage In Harlem etc and I'd like to see more movies from him. But I also understand that before that happens you will see more films from Uwe Boll and Quentin Tarantino(the most overrated director in the world!). This movie might not have won any awards or gotten praise by these high brow snobs and the trend-following puppets that run amok on IMDb but its still an excellent piece of work directed by Bill Duke(who stared in Commando, Predator, Exit Wounds, National Security and Busta Rhymes' Dangerous video) with excellent performances from an all-star cast. Set in the Depression Era of 1930s Harlem, The only way people could make money was through the "Numbers racket which is ran by Stephanie St. Clair(Cicely Tyson) also known as " The Queen". An arrogant and brash gangster called Dutch Schultz wants to take control of the numbers game and ends up bumping heads with Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson(Laurence Fishburne) who is just released from jail. These two get into a series of wars and everything starts to get out of control. Laurence Fishburne as well as Tim Roth were great in this film. Andy Garcia played it mellow as Lucky Luciano but he was better here than he was in 8 Million Ways To Die. There are also some solid performances here by Cicely Tyson, Loretta Devine, Chi Mcbride(Illinois) and Vanessa Williams(Bumpy's love interest). As far as complaints I have none. Hoodlum is well written and well acted. It pays homage to gangsters but doesn't glorify them. I tip my hat of to Bill Duke for this one. Two thumbs up as high up as they can go.

    Hoodlum is the story black a black underclass gangster who stands toe-to-toe with the Italian and Jewish Mafia in Harlem during 1930's in the great depression era. I checked out the story from watching the movie on Sunday and what I can say that yes there were several factual occurrences that took place during that time, however Hoodlum ends up turning its-self into some sort action flick rather than a factual account of what really happened, having said that it is still a very entertaining movie to watch and has some good performances as well as well made action scenes. Laurence Fishburne was excellent as the charming, and wise Bumpy Johnson who shows us an educated black man not afraid to stand up for what he believes in, Tim Roth was excellent as the unstable Ducth Schultz although I found my-self comparing him to Joe Pesci at times , and Andy Garcia as Lucy Lucoina was good with his screen time however I felt the stand out performance was Cicley Tyson who portrayed a very strong, elegant , proud Black woman. The movie rolled on fast and got into the swing straight away , there was good use of make-up , wardrobe and scenery which gave us a feel of 1930's Harlem. The interaction between characters is good as it gives us a real feel of what life was like back then. However the problems with Hoodlum are that the script seems a little superficial and characters which can have real depth to them normal end up being well quite flat. The film was supposed to be about real life events but it just seems to way to far fetched to the point where it does feel like a no brain action movie and the action it-self seems to be tit-for-tat repetitive although Fishburane's performance keeps you guessing how will he strike back and thusly the second half of the movie just feels messy and rushed. To conclude Hoodlum is probably not one of the best gangster movies about the black era to come I mean it is over shadowed by the likes of American Gangster but it does however manage to entertain on a big scale and is not a waste of time , its just a shame with a few clear faults in it however I would recommend as a rental and worth a check out for fans of the gangster genre. HOODLUM : 8.1 OUT OF 10 POWER IS MEASURED IN ENEMIES...

    A pretty good "old mobs" mafia picture, this time with a black gang in the forefront, which is a breath of fresh air. The cast is good, with the exception of Vanessa Williams who is blah; here's a fixed-my-nose Miss-America-Contest winner that both sings and acts; clearly she has been allowed by too many casting and record-company bozos to overstretch her limited talents. Talk about the legendary Hollywood "casting couch"! Tim Roth takes a while to get used to, with his phony New Yoyk accent; casting an Englishman, even one as terrific as Roth, to play a 30s NY mobster with a heavy accent is definitely what I would call unnecessary  to put it mildly. There are plenty of interesting twists and turns and goings-on, including good action scenes. However, a couple of them weren't too credible; firstly, the assassination attempt at Fishburne was far-fetched, and, secondly, Roth's death is too unrealistic and over-the-top. When one compares this movie's Schultz and Luciano, and the way they were shown in "Billy Bathgate", then one has to wonder which is more accurate, since the two sets of portrayals tend to differ. But considering they're both Hollywood version, both I assume are way off the mark, as entertaining as the movies may be.

    I would highly recommend the movie. I am not a big fan of gangster movies but this one it's much larger than that. I was browsing through my cable channels, stumbled on it and got hooked right away. The performances are awesome, the directing excellent, the costumes & sets perfect. And the story, well...true. That's what makes the movie even more attractive. The reason I am posting this comment - I've never done it before - is because I got irritated by critics' opinion about it. I am no movie expert, but to trash this one it's just plain or deliberate oversight. Please don't skip the movie just because somebody else tells you so. Give it a shot and you won't regret it. I promise.

Like "The Godfather II" and "Once Upon A Time in America," "Hoodlum" charts the rise of the Godfather of Harlem in a ruthless game of survival that claims his best friend Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride of "I, Robot") and leaves Bumpy forever altered by the gory experience. Ostensibly, you won't see anything in "Hoodlum" that you haven't seen in dozens of other crime films. "Hoodlum" features notorious real-life racketeers such as Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth of "Pulp Fiction") and Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia of "Godfather III") as well as corrupt special prosecutor Thomas Dewey (William Atherton of "The Sugarland Express). When Bumpy arrives in Harlem, he watches a numbers runner working for Madam Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson) who is the so-called 'Queen of the Numbers.' The Dutchman craves to absorb the territory that the Madam has struggled for a decade to build into the number one home-grown Harlem business. Bumpy vows to prevent any takeover by the Irish mob. Meanwhile, the boorish, grubby, low-life Schultz refuses to appease Lucky or Bumpy. Along the way, Bumpy falls in love with righteous Francine (Vanessa Williams) who wants him to find respectable work. Bumpy refuses to stoop to menial employment. When Dutch cannot kill the Madam, he bribes a judge to send her to the pen. Bumpy supervises the Madam's empire at her request during her absence. Bumpy's bloodthirsty methods clash with her live-and-let-live notions. Eventually, Luciano and Bumpy strike a deal, and Dutch finds himself out in the cold. Suddenly, gangster gunfire chops down a young, innocent numbers runner. Now, Bumpy's cronies think that he has gone too far. Francine bails out on him more out of the formulaic dictates of the story than for any motivated reason. So do the filmmakers. The second half of the movie shows Bumpy losing favor with everybody. The film's publicity notes claim that "Hoodlum" is complete fiction, but historical characters populate the story. Of course, movies rarely recreate history with any fidelity. History is more chaotic than dramatic, so filmmakers recast it to fit their dramatic formulas. One way is by cutting the number of characters. Refusing to portray these events as they actually occurred, Duke and Brancato blow a fantastic opportunity to exploit their melodramatic potential. Duke, whose directorial credits include "Deep Cover" and "A Rage in Harlem," wrestles with the obvious lapses in Brancato's script. The length of "Hoodlum" may have been cut by the studio to squeeze in more showings in a single evening. The action grows and takes on an episodic quality when Bumpy becomes callous. After the first half, the film's momentum bogs down, and "Hoodlum" loses its air of fun. The time has come for the characters to pay the piper. The filmmakers embrace a curious morality. In most gangster movies, the hoodlum hero must die. Bumpy gets off easy, as does Luciano and only Dutch antes up with his life. Duke and Brancato allow their criminals greater leniency. The gangsters are less cancerous than the defenders of justice. Consequently, "Hoodlum" concludes on an anti-climax. Moreover, the filmmakers neglect to post an epilogue about Bumpy's outcome. For the record, the gangster who hires Shaft to find his kidnapped daughter in "Shaft" is a variation on Bumpy" as is the kingpin mobster in "American Gangster" with Denzel Washington. The problem with Brancato's script is its uneven quality. The action-packed first half is more entertaining than the tedious, long-winded second half. The filmmakers glorify Bumpy initially as a Robin Hood gangster who steals from a rival mob and gives to Harlem's starving citizens. Fishburne is riveting as a tough-as-nails but warm-hearted criminal. Roth takes top acting honors, however, as Dutch Schultz and looks like he had a ball exaggerating those vile elements in Schultz's psychotic behavior. Garcia epitomizes sartorial urbanity as the peace-making Italian gangster who divides his time between Bumpy, Dutch, and special prosecutor Dewey. Atherton's egotistical special prosecutor bristles with revulsion in his dealings with these crooks, but accepts their bribes. The filmmakers make the repressive Dewey appear particularly loathsome, a Judas whose contempt for the mob is exceeded only by his mockery of justice. Despite some flavorful dialogue, "Hoodlum" plays it straight down the line as a dramatic shoot'em up. Audiences expecting a variation on Eddie Murphy's "Harlem Nights" may leave this Fishburne film disappointed. Although it's no "Godfather," "Hoodlum" is definitely above-average and far beyond those 1970s camp classics that headlined Fred Williamson as the black Caesar of crime in "Hell Up in Harlem." If you enjoy gangster epics, "Hoodlum" is worth the price of admission. Some critics have savaged "Hoodlum" for its debatable morality. Ironically, Bumpy rises to the summit of his profession. At fade-out, however, Duke and Brancato show that the gangster's life is one that leaves you standing alone in the rain outside the church door without a friend.

    You people are nuts! This is just atrocious film wrecking. The script reminded me of a mad libs where instead of a noun, they just wrote curse words and racial slurs. It felt like the creators were aiming at entertaining the homeless insane demographic instead of intelligent individuals who wouldn't see straight through this malarky. But I have a story with this film that made it worth seeing. There was 7 people in the theater when we stumbled into this car wreck of a movie, my three friends, two other guys a few seats down and an African American couple in front of us. I was so offended by this film's utter lack of cohesive character plot, goals and motivations, creativity, etc., that my friends and I debated with the strangers next to us in the theater whether we should just leave and play area 51, a game we loathed! I was actually worried that because I was white, maybe the couple in front of us would think we were a bunch of racist jerks for leaving half way through, because it seemed to be really pretending that it was a powerful Black statement. Then the AA couple started laughing every time Larry Fishbourne said "N***** pennies" and we stayed. Two thirds in, all 7 of us turned it into a MST3K episode. We were laughing at every other line, inserting show tunes at inappropriate moments and would loudly boo and call the actors names any time the pennies were mentioned. I never would have done this had the AA dude not started throwing Junior Mints at the screen. All in all, terribly wooden acting, eerily clean set design for the 30's, bizarre and frustratingly convoluted plot and lame ass action. But hilarious theater experience.

    Bill Duke has made some great movies like Sister Act 2, Deep Cover, A Rage In Harlem etc and I'd like to see more movies from him. But I also understand that before that happens you will see more films from Uwe Boll and Quentin Tarantino(the most overrated director in the world!). This movie might not have won any awards or gotten praise by these high brow snobs and the trend-following puppets that run amok on IMDb but its still an excellent piece of work directed by Bill Duke(who stared in Commando, Predator, Exit Wounds, National Security and Busta Rhymes' Dangerous video) with excellent performances from an all-star cast. Set in the Depression Era of 1930s Harlem, The only way people could make money was through the "Numbers racket which is ran by Stephanie St. Clair(Cicely Tyson) also known as " The Queen". An arrogant and brash gangster called Dutch Schultz wants to take control of the numbers game and ends up bumping heads with Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson(Laurence Fishburne) who is just released from jail. These two get into a series of wars and everything starts to get out of control. Laurence Fishburne as well as Tim Roth were great in this film. Andy Garcia played it mellow as Lucky Luciano but he was better here than he was in 8 Million Ways To Die. There are also some solid performances here by Cicely Tyson, Loretta Devine, Chi Mcbride(Illinois) and Vanessa Williams(Bumpy's love interest). As far as complaints I have none. Hoodlum is well written and well acted. It pays homage to gangsters but doesn't glorify them. I tip my hat of to Bill Duke for this one. Two thumbs up as high up as they can go.

    Hoodlum is the story black a black underclass gangster who stands toe-to-toe with the Italian and Jewish Mafia in Harlem during 1930's in the great depression era. I checked out the story from watching the movie on Sunday and what I can say that yes there were several factual occurrences that took place during that time, however Hoodlum ends up turning its-self into some sort action flick rather than a factual account of what really happened, having said that it is still a very entertaining movie to watch and has some good performances as well as well made action scenes. Laurence Fishburne was excellent as the charming, and wise Bumpy Johnson who shows us an educated black man not afraid to stand up for what he believes in, Tim Roth was excellent as the unstable Ducth Schultz although I found my-self comparing him to Joe Pesci at times , and Andy Garcia as Lucy Lucoina was good with his screen time however I felt the stand out performance was Cicley Tyson who portrayed a very strong, elegant , proud Black woman. The movie rolled on fast and got into the swing straight away , there was good use of make-up , wardrobe and scenery which gave us a feel of 1930's Harlem. The interaction between characters is good as it gives us a real feel of what life was like back then. However the problems with Hoodlum are that the script seems a little superficial and characters which can have real depth to them normal end up being well quite flat. The film was supposed to be about real life events but it just seems to way to far fetched to the point where it does feel like a no brain action movie and the action it-self seems to be tit-for-tat repetitive although Fishburane's performance keeps you guessing how will he strike back and thusly the second half of the movie just feels messy and rushed. To conclude Hoodlum is probably not one of the best gangster movies about the black era to come I mean it is over shadowed by the likes of American Gangster but it does however manage to entertain on a big scale and is not a waste of time , its just a shame with a few clear faults in it however I would recommend as a rental and worth a check out for fans of the gangster genre. HOODLUM : 8.1 OUT OF 10 POWER IS MEASURED IN ENEMIES...

    A pretty good "old mobs" mafia picture, this time with a black gang in the forefront, which is a breath of fresh air. The cast is good, with the exception of Vanessa Williams who is blah; here's a fixed-my-nose Miss-America-Contest winner that both sings and acts; clearly she has been allowed by too many casting and record-company bozos to overstretch her limited talents. Talk about the legendary Hollywood "casting couch"! Tim Roth takes a while to get used to, with his phony New Yoyk accent; casting an Englishman, even one as terrific as Roth, to play a 30s NY mobster with a heavy accent is definitely what I would call unnecessary  to put it mildly. There are plenty of interesting twists and turns and goings-on, including good action scenes. However, a couple of them weren't too credible; firstly, the assassination attempt at Fishburne was far-fetched, and, secondly, Roth's death is too unrealistic and over-the-top. When one compares this movie's Schultz and Luciano, and the way they were shown in "Billy Bathgate", then one has to wonder which is more accurate, since the two sets of portrayals tend to differ. But considering they're both Hollywood version, both I assume are way off the mark, as entertaining as the movies may be.

    I would highly recommend the movie. I am not a big fan of gangster movies but this one it's much larger than that. I was browsing through my cable channels, stumbled on it and got hooked right away. The performances are awesome, the directing excellent, the costumes & sets perfect. And the story, well...true. That's what makes the movie even more attractive. The reason I am posting this comment - I've never done it before - is because I got irritated by critics' opinion about it. I am no movie expert, but to trash this one it's just plain or deliberate oversight. Please don't skip the movie just because somebody else tells you so. Give it a shot and you won't regret it. I promise.

    Director Bill Duke is attempting a grand gangster movie, but really don't have the skills of a master filmmaker to pull it off. The pace is ponderous. And even the action is unenergetic. Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) is a gang leader of 1930's Harlem whose successful 'Numbers' racket attracts ruthless Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) from downtown. Meanwhile gangland boss Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia) try to negotiate his way in. Bumpy refuses to give in, and violence ensues. There are a lot of great actors, but there are also some distracting overacting. Laurence Fishburne is great, and Tim Roth is wonderful as a bad guy. But I wouldn't recommend this even with these great actors.

    People who have seen American Gangster or are regular viewers of the TV show, Mobsters, will know who Bumpy Johnson was and know the story behind Hoodlum. For those of you who don't, Johnson was a member of an organized crime group, in Harlem, during the 1930's. He was also the man who mentored and inspired Denzel Washington's character of Frank Lucas in American Gangster. Long before that film, the story of Bumpy Johnson was told in Hoodlum. This was one of those little told stories about the mafia that started out very strong. Unfortunately, I felt that the writers went into far too much detail at certain points in the film and by the end it was definitely dragging on. Laurence Fishburne stars as Johnson and did an adequate job, my problem with his has always been he lacks emotion in his acting. In my humble opinion this should automatically disqualify him from certain things and this probably should have been one of those things. Tim Roth is Dutch Schultz and while Schultz had a reputation for being a character, Roth went a little over the top with it, but was still very entertaining. My favorite performance was of course the one by Andy Garcia as Lucky Luciano, but he really wasn't in the film much and that's a shame, because nobody plays a crime boss better than hen does. Hoodlum is a wild ride about an incredible true story, but as a film, it was a mix of terrific scenes and some slower unnecessary elements. As a film it's not the best, but it's worth watching just for the amazing story that is being told.

    This is a movie set in the 1930's in Harlem. It is the height of the depression and a Negro, Bumpy Johnson, has just been released from gaol. He returns to find that the Queen's gambling racket is being threatened by a white man from downtown. Everybody in Harlem is happy with the way things are - people play the numbers game and win enough to put food on the table. But numbers is a very big business and the mafia wants a piece of it. The mafia boss of the time, Lucky Lucino, is content to let it go, but one of his underlings wants a piece of the action and soon a gang war breaks out. This is the typical inter-war style movie with corrupt cops and politicians and crime running rife. The prohibition years are over, but people are making money now by other rackets, and the American system of brutal monopoly is leaving blood on the streets and the corrupt politicians are supporting those who have the most money. It is a time of lawlessness and strife, and in a way we should feel glad we don't live there. Another thing about the time is that the Negro is still very much in the underclass and there is a lot of prejudice and tension between the races. The major theme here is how power corrupts. The Queen is taken to gaol and she gives Bumpy the business to run. Bumpy is a very intelligent man, but he is also very stubborn. He refuses to give into the non-Negros and will continue to fight until one is dead. Unfortunately his stubbornness brings about the death of many innocent people. During this time, his girlfriend walks out on him, and his cousin begins to disown him, yet he refuses to give in because he believes he is right. This movie really looks at the tragedy of this, but it is not that tragic because Bumpy soon sees how he has changed and will begin to change before it is too late. But then with the death of his cousin, one can argue it is too late. His girlfriend has left, and chastises him for being so stubborn that he refuses to step into a church to pay respects for one of the dead. He finally steps into a church to pay respect to his cousin, and then walks straight out. As such we see the beginning of a change, but we don't follow through with it. The problems have been solved, and Harlem has its autonomy - what happens to Bumpy in the future is for the future.

    Interesting film about the rise of Ellsworth "Bumpy" Morgan portrayed by Lauwrence Fishburn and the fall of "Dutch" Schultz portrayed by Tim Roth. My preference goes to the Dustin Hoffman version of "Dutch" Schultz in the more accurate rendering featured in "Billy Bathgate". "Hoodlum" falls short when they showcase Dutch being hit by his own henchman in the restaurant bathroom while in "Billy Bathgate" they get it historically right as Dutch's gang (five men) are wiped out in the restaurant by "Lucky" Luciano's gang. Hoodlum may fall short on accuracy but keeps the viewer on their toes as to what happens next. Probably one of the most accurate films I have ever seen was Rod Stieger's performance in "Al Capone".

    Snap-brim fedoras, vintage autos, blazing Tommy guns, corrupt public officials and greedy mobsters battling it out over turf rights recur throughout director Bill Duke's violent, 1930s' racketeering epic "Hoodlum," a pictorially authentic actioneer that evokes memories of the classic Robert Stack television series "The Untouchables." Although "Hoodlum" boasts a top-drawer cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Vanessa Williams, Tim Roth, and Andy Garcia, this lavishly mounted but uneven gangster saga suffers from its rambling length, garrulous script and a shortage of shoot-outs. As the first major film to headline the crimes of Harlem's infamous Black Godfather Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson, this production offers a novel departure for audiences that are weary of superheroes, female warriors and hard-bitten cops who have were crowding the big-screen when "Hoodlum" appeared in 1997. The Chris Brancato screenplay introduces Bumpy in 1934 as he exits Sing Sing Prison. Duke and Brancato exert great pains to differentiate Bumpy from the typical African-American mobster. He peruses books, plays chess, and pens poetry. As literate as Bumpy is, he can pull a trigger or wield a knife without a pang of remorse when somebody threatens a person who he loves. Like "The Godfather II" and "Once Upon A Time in America," "Hoodlum" charts the rise of the Godfather of Harlem in a ruthless game of survival that claims his best friend Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride of "I, Robot") and leaves Bumpy forever altered by the gory experience. Ostensibly, you won't see anything in "Hoodlum" that you haven't seen in dozens of other crime films. "Hoodlum" features notorious real-life racketeers such as Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth of "Pulp Fiction") and Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia of "Godfather III") as well as corrupt special prosecutor Thomas Dewey (William Atherton of "The Sugarland Express). When Bumpy arrives in Harlem, he watches a numbers runner working for Madam Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson) who is the so-called 'Queen of the Numbers.' The Dutchman craves to absorb the territory that the Madam has struggled for a decade to build into the number one home-grown Harlem business. Bumpy vows to prevent any takeover by the Irish mob. Meanwhile, the boorish, grubby, low-life Schultz refuses to appease Lucky or Bumpy. Along the way, Bumpy falls in love with righteous Francine (Vanessa Williams) who wants him to find respectable work. Bumpy refuses to stoop to menial employment. When Dutch cannot kill the Madam, he bribes a judge to send her to the pen. Bumpy supervises the Madam's empire at her request during her absence. Bumpy's bloodthirsty methods clash with her live-and-let-live notions. Eventually, Luciano and Bumpy strike a deal, and Dutch finds himself out in the cold. Suddenly, gangster gunfire chops down a young, innocent numbers runner. Now, Bumpy's cronies think that he has gone too far. Francine bails out on him more out of the formulaic dictates of the story than for any motivated reason. So do the filmmakers. The second half of the movie shows Bumpy losing favor with everybody. The film's publicity notes claim that "Hoodlum" is complete fiction, but historical characters populate the story. Of course, movies rarely recreate history with any fidelity. History is more chaotic than dramatic, so filmmakers recast it to fit their dramatic formulas. One way is by cutting the number of characters.

The length of "Hoodlum" may have been cut by the studio to squeeze in more showings in a single evening. The action grows and takes on an episodic quality when Bumpy becomes callous. After the first half, the film's momentum bogs down, and "Hoodlum" loses its air of fun. The time has come for the characters to pay the piper. The filmmakers embrace a curious morality. In most gangster movies, the hoodlum hero must die. Bumpy gets off easy, as does Luciano and only Dutch antes up with his life. Duke and Brancato allow their criminals greater leniency. The gangsters are less cancerous than the defenders of justice. Consequently, "Hoodlum" concludes on an anti-climax. Moreover, the filmmakers neglect to post an epilogue about Bumpy's outcome.

The problem with Brancato's script is its uneven quality. The action-packed first half is more entertaining than the tedious, long-winded second half. The filmmakers glorify Bumpy initially as a Robin Hood gangster who steals from a rival mob and gives to Harlem's starving citizens. Fishburne is riveting as a tough-as-nails but warm-hearted criminal. Roth takes top acting honors, however, as Dutch Schultz and looks like he had a ball exaggerating those vile elements in Schultz's psychotic behavior. Garcia epitomizes sartorial urbanity as the peace-making Italian gangster who divides his time between Bumpy, Dutch, and special prosecutor Dewey. Atherton's egotistical special prosecutor bristles with revulsion in his dealings with these crooks, but accepts their bribes. The filmmakers make the repressive Dewey appear particularly loathsome, a Judas whose contempt for the mob is exceeded only by his mockery of justice. Despite some flavorful dialogue, "Hoodlum" plays it straight down the line as a dramatic shoot'em up. Audiences expecting a variation on Eddie Murphy's "Harlem Nights" may leave this Fishburne film disappointed. Although it's no "Godfather," "Hoodlum" is definitely above-average and far beyond those 1970s camp classics that headlined Fred Williamson as the black Caesar of crime in "Hell Up in Harlem."

The film was supposed to be about real life events but it just seems to way to far fetched to the point where it does feel like a no brain action movie and the action it-self seems to be tit-for-tat repetitive although Fishburane's performance keeps you guessing how will he strike back and thusly the second half of the movie just feels messy and rushed. To conclude Hoodlum is probably not one of the best gangster movies about the black era to come I mean it is over shadowed by the likes of American Gangster but it does however manage to entertain on a big scale and is not a waste of time , its just a shame with a few clear faults in it however I would recommend as a rental and worth a check out for fans of the gangster genre.

    A pretty good "old mobs" mafia picture, this time with a black gang in the forefront, which is a breath of fresh air. The cast is good, with the exception of Vanessa Williams who is blah; here's a fixed-my-nose Miss-America-Contest winner that both sings and acts; clearly she has been allowed by too many casting and record-company bozos to overstretch her limited talents. Talk about the legendary Hollywood "casting couch"! Tim Roth takes a while to get used to, with his phony New Yoyk accent; casting an Englishman, even one as terrific as Roth, to play a 30s NY mobster with a heavy accent is definitely what I would call unnecessary  to put it mildly. There are plenty of interesting twists and turns and goings-on, including good action scenes. However, a couple of them weren't too credible; firstly, the assassination attempt at Fishburne was far-fetched, and, secondly, Roth's death is too unrealistic and over-the-top. When one compares this movie's Schultz and Luciano, and the way they were shown in "Billy Bathgate", then one has to wonder which is more accurate, since the two sets of portrayals tend to differ. But considering they're both Hollywood version, both I assume are way off the mark, as entertaining as the movies may be.

    I would highly recommend the movie. I am not a big fan of gangster movies but this one it's much larger than that. I was browsing through my cable channels, stumbled on it and got hooked right away. The performances are awesome, the directing excellent, the costumes & sets perfect. And the story, well...true. That's what makes the movie even more attractive. The reason I am posting this comment - I've never done it before - is because I got irritated by critics' opinion about it. I am no movie expert, but to trash this one it's just plain or deliberate oversight. Please don't skip the movie just because somebody else tells you so. Give it a shot and you won't regret it. I promise.

    Director Bill Duke is attempting a grand gangster movie, but really don't have the skills of a master filmmaker to pull it off. The pace is ponderous. And even the action is unenergetic. Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) is a gang leader of 1930's Harlem whose successful 'Numbers' racket attracts ruthless Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) from downtown. Meanwhile gangland boss Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia) try to negotiate his way in. Bumpy refuses to give in, and violence ensues. There are a lot of great actors, but there are also some distracting overacting. Laurence Fishburne is great, and Tim Roth is wonderful as a bad guy. But I wouldn't recommend this even with these great actors.

    People who have seen American Gangster or are regular viewers of the TV show, Mobsters, will know who Bumpy Johnson was and know the story behind Hoodlum. For those of you who don't, Johnson was a member of an organized crime group, in Harlem, during the 1930's. He was also the man who mentored and inspired Denzel Washington's character of Frank Lucas in American Gangster. Long before that film, the story of Bumpy Johnson was told in Hoodlum. This was one of those little told stories about the mafia that started out very strong. Unfortunately, I felt that the writers went into far too much detail at certain points in the film and by the end it was definitely dragging on. Laurence Fishburne stars as Johnson and did an adequate job, my problem with his has always been he lacks emotion in his acting. In my humble opinion this should automatically disqualify him from certain things and this probably should have been one of those things. Tim Roth is Dutch Schultz and while Schultz had a reputation for being a character, Roth went a little over the top with it, but was still very entertaining. My favorite performance was of course the one by Andy Garcia as Lucky Luciano, but he really wasn't in the film much and that's a shame, because nobody plays a crime boss better than hen does. Hoodlum is a wild ride about an incredible true story, but as a film, it was a mix of terrific scenes and some slower unnecessary elements. As a film it's not the best, but it's worth watching just for the amazing story that is being told.

    This is a movie set in the 1930's in Harlem. It is the height of the depression and a Negro, Bumpy Johnson, has just been released from gaol. He returns to find that the Queen's gambling racket is being threatened by a white man from downtown. Everybody in Harlem is happy with the way things are - people play the numbers game and win enough to put food on the table. But numbers is a very big business and the mafia wants a piece of it. The mafia boss of the time, Lucky Lucino, is content to let it go, but one of his underlings wants a piece of the action and soon a gang war breaks out. This is the typical inter-war style movie with corrupt cops and politicians and crime running rife. The prohibition years are over, but people are making money now by other rackets, and the American system of brutal monopoly is leaving blood on the streets and the corrupt politicians are supporting those who have the most money. It is a time of lawlessness and strife, and in a way we should feel glad we don't live there. Another thing about the time is that the Negro is still very much in the underclass and there is a lot of prejudice and tension between the races. The major theme here is how power corrupts. The Queen is taken to gaol and she gives Bumpy the business to run. Bumpy is a very intelligent man, but he is also very stubborn. He refuses to give into the non-Negros and will continue to fight until one is dead. Unfortunately his stubbornness brings about the death of many innocent people. During this time, his girlfriend walks out on him, and his cousin begins to disown him, yet he refuses to give in because he believes he is right. This movie really looks at the tragedy of this, but it is not that tragic because Bumpy soon sees how he has changed and will begin to change before it is too late. But then with the death of his cousin, one can argue it is too late. His girlfriend has left, and chastises him for being so stubborn that he refuses to step into a church to pay respects for one of the dead. He finally steps into a church to pay respect to his cousin, and then walks straight out. As such we see the beginning of a change, but we don't follow through with it. The problems have been solved, and Harlem has its autonomy - what happens to Bumpy in the future is for the future.

    Interesting film about the rise of Ellsworth "Bumpy" Morgan portrayed by Lauwrence Fishburn and the fall of "Dutch" Schultz portrayed by Tim Roth. My preference goes to the Dustin Hoffman version of "Dutch" Schultz in the more accurate rendering featured in "Billy Bathgate". "Hoodlum" falls short when they showcase Dutch being hit by his own henchman in the restaurant bathroom while in "Billy Bathgate" they get it historically right as Dutch's gang (five men) are wiped out in the restaurant by "Lucky" Luciano's gang. Hoodlum may fall short on accuracy but keeps the viewer on their toes as to what happens next. Probably one of the most accurate films I have ever seen was Rod Stieger's performance in "Al Capone".

    A Lavishly Mounted But Uneven Black Gangster Epic With a Superior Cast

    Snap-brim fedoras, vintage autos, blazing Tommy guns, corrupt public officials and greedy mobsters battling it out over turf rights recur throughout director Bill Duke's violent, 1930s' racketeering epic "Hoodlum," a pictorially authentic actioneer that evokes memories of the classic Robert Stack television series "The Untouchables." Although "Hoodlum" boasts a top-drawer cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Vanessa Williams, Tim Roth, and Andy Garcia, this lavishly mounted but uneven gangster saga suffers from its rambling length, garrulous script and a shortage of shoot-outs. As the first major film to headline the crimes of Harlem's infamous Black Godfather Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson, this production offers a novel departure for audiences that are weary of superheroes, female warriors and hard-bitten cops who have were crowding the big-screen when "Hoodlum" appeared in 1997. The Chris Brancato screenplay introduces Bumpy in 1934 as he exits Sing Sing Prison. Duke and Brancato exert great pains to differentiate Bumpy from the typical African-American mobster. He peruses books, plays chess, and pens poetry. As literate as Bumpy is, he can pull a trigger or wield a knife without a pang of remorse when somebody threatens a person who he loves. Like "The Godfather II" and "Once Upon A Time in America," "Hoodlum" charts the rise of the Godfather of Harlem in a ruthless game of survival that claims his best friend Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride of "I, Robot") and leaves Bumpy forever altered by the gory experience. Ostensibly, you won't see anything in "Hoodlum" that you haven't seen in dozens of other crime films. "Hoodlum" features notorious real-life racketeers such as Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth of "Pulp Fiction") and Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia of "Godfather III") as well as corrupt special prosecutor Thomas Dewey (William Atherton of "The Sugarland Express). When Bumpy arrives in Harlem, he watches a numbers runner working for Madam Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson) who is the so-called 'Queen of the Numbers.' The Dutchman craves to absorb the territory that the Madam has struggled for a decade to build into the number one home-grown Harlem business. Bumpy vows to prevent any takeover by the Irish mob. Meanwhile, the boorish, grubby, low-life Schultz refuses to appease Lucky or Bumpy. Along the way, Bumpy falls in love with righteous Francine (Vanessa Williams) who wants him to find respectable work. Bumpy refuses to stoop to menial employment. When Dutch cannot kill the Madam, he bribes a judge to send her to the pen. Bumpy supervises the Madam's empire at her request during her absence. Bumpy's bloodthirsty methods clash with her live-and-let-live notions. Eventually, Luciano and Bumpy strike a deal, and Dutch finds himself out in the cold. Suddenly, gangster gunfire chops down a young, innocent numbers runner. Now, Bumpy's cronies think that he has gone too far. Francine bails out on him more out of the formulaic dictates of the story than for any motivated reason. So do the filmmakers. The second half of the movie shows Bumpy losing favor with everybody. The film's publicity notes claim that "Hoodlum" is complete fiction, but historical characters populate the story. Of course, movies rarely recreate history with any fidelity. History is more chaotic than dramatic, so filmmakers recast it to fit their dramatic formulas. One way is by cutting the number of characters. Refusing to portray these events as they actually occurred, Duke and Brancato blow a fantastic opportunity to exploit their melodramatic potential. Duke, whose directorial credits include "Deep Cover" and "A Rage in Harlem," wrestles with the obvious lapses in Brancato's script. The length of "Hoodlum" may have been cut by the studio to squeeze in more showings in a single evening. The action grows and takes on an episodic quality when Bumpy becomes callous. After the first half, the film's momentum bogs down, and "Hoodlum" loses its air of fun. The time has come for the characters to pay the piper. The filmmakers embrace a curious morality. In most gangster movies, the hoodlum hero must die. Bumpy gets off easy, as does Luciano and only Dutch antes up with his life. Duke and Brancato allow their criminals greater leniency. The gangsters are less cancerous than the defenders of justice. Consequently, "Hoodlum" concludes on an anti-climax. Moreover, the filmmakers neglect to post an epilogue about Bumpy's outcome. For the record, the gangster who hires Shaft to find his kidnapped daughter in "Shaft" is a variation on Bumpy" as is the kingpin mobster in "American Gangster" with Denzel Washington. The problem with Brancato's script is its uneven quality. The action-packed first half is more entertaining than the tedious, long-winded second half. The filmmakers glorify Bumpy initially as a Robin Hood gangster who steals from a rival mob and gives to Harlem's starving citizens. Fishburne is riveting as a tough-as-nails but warm-hearted criminal. Roth takes top acting honors, however, as Dutch Schultz and looks like he had a ball exaggerating those vile elements in Schultz's psychotic behavior. Garcia epitomizes sartorial urbanity as the peace-making Italian gangster who divides his time between Bumpy, Dutch, and special prosecutor Dewey. Atherton's egotistical special prosecutor bristles with revulsion in his dealings with these crooks, but accepts their bribes. The filmmakers make the repressive Dewey appear particularly loathsome, a Judas whose contempt for the mob is exceeded only by his mockery of justice. Despite some flavorful dialogue, "Hoodlum" plays it straight down the line as a dramatic shoot'em up. Audiences expecting a variation on Eddie Murphy's "Harlem Nights" may leave this Fishburne film disappointed. Although it's no "Godfather," "Hoodlum" is definitely above-average and far beyond those 1970s camp classics that headlined Fred Williamson as the black Caesar of crime in "Hell Up in Harlem." If you enjoy gangster epics, "Hoodlum" is worth the price of admission. Some critics have savaged "Hoodlum" for its debatable morality. Ironically, Bumpy rises to the summit of his profession. At fade-out, however, Duke and Brancato show that the gangster's life is one that leaves you standing alone in the rain outside the church door without a friend.

    You people are nuts! This is just atrocious film wrecking. The script reminded me of a mad libs where instead of a noun, they just wrote curse words and racial slurs. It felt like the creators were aiming at entertaining the homeless insane demographic instead of intelligent individuals who wouldn't see straight through this malarky. But I have a story with this film that made it worth seeing. There was 7 people in the theater when we stumbled into this car wreck of a movie, my three friends, two other guys a few seats down and an African American couple in front of us. I was so offended by this film's utter lack of cohesive character plot, goals and motivations, creativity, etc., that my friends and I debated with the strangers next to us in the theater whether we should just leave and play area 51, a game we loathed! I was actually worried that because I was white, maybe the couple in front of us would think we were a bunch of racist jerks for leaving half way through, because it seemed to be really pretending that it was a powerful Black statement. Then the AA couple started laughing every time Larry Fishbourne said "N***** pennies" and we stayed. Two thirds in, all 7 of us turned it into a MST3K episode. We were laughing at every other line, inserting show tunes at inappropriate moments and would loudly boo and call the actors names any time the pennies were mentioned. I never would have done this had the AA dude not started throwing Junior Mints at the screen. All in all, terribly wooden acting, eerily clean set design for the 30's, bizarre and frustratingly convoluted plot and lame ass action. But hilarious theater experience.

    Bill Duke has made some great movies like Sister Act 2, Deep Cover, A Rage In Harlem etc and I'd like to see more movies from him. But I also understand that before that happens you will see more films from Uwe Boll and Quentin Tarantino(the most overrated director in the world!). This movie might not have won any awards or gotten praise by these high brow snobs and the trend-following puppets that run amok on IMDb but its still an excellent piece of work directed by Bill Duke(who stared in Commando, Predator, Exit Wounds, National Security and Busta Rhymes' Dangerous video) with excellent performances from an all-star cast. Set in the Depression Era of 1930s Harlem, The only way people could make money was through the "Numbers racket which is ran by Stephanie St. Clair(Cicely Tyson) also known as " The Queen". An arrogant and brash gangster called Dutch Schultz wants to take control of the numbers game and ends up bumping heads with Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson(Laurence Fishburne) who is just released from jail. These two get into a series of wars and everything starts to get out of control. Laurence Fishburne as well as Tim Roth were great in this film. Andy Garcia played it mellow as Lucky Luciano but he was better here than he was in 8 Million Ways To Die. There are also some solid performances here by Cicely Tyson, Loretta Devine, Chi Mcbride(Illinois) and Vanessa Williams(Bumpy's love interest). As far as complaints I have none. Hoodlum is well written and well acted. It pays homage to gangsters but doesn't glorify them. I tip my hat of to Bill Duke for this one. Two thumbs up as high up as they can go.

    Hoodlum is the story black a black underclass gangster who stands toe-to-toe with the Italian and Jewish Mafia in Harlem during 1930's in the great depression era. I checked out the story from watching the movie on Sunday and what I can say that yes there were several factual occurrences that took place during that time, however Hoodlum ends up turning its-self into some sort action flick rather than a factual account of what really happened, having said that it is still a very entertaining movie to watch and has some good performances as well as well made action scenes. Laurence Fishburne was excellent as the charming, and wise Bumpy Johnson who shows us an educated black man not afraid to stand up for what he believes in, Tim Roth was excellent as the unstable Ducth Schultz although I found my-self comparing him to Joe Pesci at times , and Andy Garcia as Lucy Lucoina was good with his screen time however I felt the stand out performance was Cicley Tyson who portrayed a very strong, elegant , proud Black woman. The movie rolled on fast and got into the swing straight away , there was good use of make-up , wardrobe and scenery which gave us a feel of 1930's Harlem. The interaction between characters is good as it gives us a real feel of what life was like back then. However the problems with Hoodlum are that the script seems a little superficial and characters which can have real depth to them normal end up being well quite flat. The film was supposed to be about real life events but it just seems to way to far fetched to the point where it does feel like a no brain action movie and the action it-self seems to be tit-for-tat repetitive although Fishburane's performance keeps you guessing how will he strike back and thusly the second half of the movie just feels messy and rushed.

    Snap-brim fedoras, vintage autos, blazing Tommy guns, corrupt public officials and greedy mobsters battling it out over turf rights recur throughout director Bill Duke's violent, 1930s' racketeering epic "Hoodlum," a pictorially authentic actioneer that evokes memories of the classic Robert Stack television series "The Untouchables." Although "Hoodlum" boasts a top-drawer cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Vanessa Williams, Tim Roth, and Andy Garcia, this lavishly mounted but uneven gangster saga suffers from its rambling length, garrulous script and a shortage of shoot-outs. As the first major film to headline the crimes of Harlem's infamous Black Godfather Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson, this production offers a novel departure for audiences that are weary of superheroes, female warriors and hard-bitten cops who have were crowding the big-screen when "Hoodlum" appeared in 1997. The Chris Brancato screenplay introduces Bumpy in 1934 as he exits Sing Sing Prison. Duke and Brancato exert great pains to differentiate Bumpy from the typical African-American mobster. He peruses books, plays chess, and pens poetry. As literate as Bumpy is, he can pull a trigger or wield a knife without a pang of remorse when somebody threatens a person who he loves. Like "The Godfather II" and "Once Upon A Time in America," "Hoodlum" charts the rise of the Godfather of Harlem in a ruthless game of survival that claims his best friend Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride of "I, Robot") and leaves Bumpy forever altered by the gory experience. Ostensibly, you won't see anything in "Hoodlum" that you haven't seen in dozens of other crime films. "Hoodlum" features notorious real-life racketeers such as Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth of "Pulp Fiction") and Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia of "Godfather III") as well as corrupt special prosecutor Thomas Dewey (William Atherton of "The Sugarland Express). When Bumpy arrives in Harlem, he watches a numbers runner working for Madam Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson) who is the so-called 'Queen of the Numbers.' The Dutchman craves to absorb the territory that the Madam has struggled for a decade to build into the number one home-grown Harlem business. Bumpy vows to prevent any takeover by the Irish mob. Meanwhile, the boorish, grubby, low-life Schultz refuses to appease Lucky or Bumpy. Along the way, Bumpy falls in love with righteous Francine (Vanessa Williams) who wants him to find respectable work. Bumpy refuses to stoop to menial employment. When Dutch cannot kill the Madam, he bribes a judge to send her to the pen. Bumpy supervises the Madam's empire at her request during her absence. Bumpy's bloodthirsty methods clash with her live-and-let-live notions. Eventually, Luciano and Bumpy strike a deal, and Dutch finds himself out in the cold. Suddenly, gangster gunfire chops down a young, innocent numbers runner. Now, Bumpy's cronies think that he has gone too far. Francine bails out on him more out of the formulaic dictates of the story than for any motivated reason. So do the filmmakers. The second half of the movie shows Bumpy losing favor with everybody. The film's publicity notes claim that "Hoodlum" is complete fiction, but historical characters populate the story. Of course, movies rarely recreate history with any fidelity. History is more chaotic than dramatic, so filmmakers recast it to fit their dramatic formulas. One way is by cutting the number of characters. Refusing to portray these events as they actually occurred, Duke and Brancato blow a fantastic opportunity to exploit their melodramatic potential. Duke, whose directorial credits include "Deep Cover" and "A Rage in Harlem," wrestles with the obvious lapses in Brancato's script. The length of "Hoodlum" may have been cut by the studio to squeeze in more showings in a single evening. The action grows and takes on an episodic quality when Bumpy becomes callous. After the first half, the film's momentum bogs down, and "Hoodlum" loses its air of fun. The time has come for the characters to pay the piper. The filmmakers embrace a curious morality. In most gangster movies, the hoodlum hero must die. Bumpy gets off easy, as does Luciano and only Dutch antes up with his life. Duke and Brancato allow their criminals greater leniency. The gangsters are less cancerous than the defenders of justice. Consequently, "Hoodlum" concludes on an anti-climax. Moreover, the filmmakers neglect to post an epilogue about Bumpy's outcome. For the record, the gangster who hires Shaft to find his kidnapped daughter in "Shaft" is a variation on Bumpy" as is the kingpin mobster in "American Gangster" with Denzel Washington. The problem with Brancato's script is its uneven quality. The action-packed first half is more entertaining than the tedious, long-winded second half. The filmmakers glorify Bumpy initially as a Robin Hood gangster who steals from a rival mob and gives to Harlem's starving citizens. Fishburne is riveting as a tough-as-nails but warm-hearted criminal. Roth takes top acting honors, however, as Dutch Schultz and looks like he had a ball exaggerating those vile elements in Schultz's psychotic behavior. Garcia epitomizes sartorial urbanity as the peace-making Italian gangster who divides his time between Bumpy, Dutch, and special prosecutor Dewey. Atherton's egotistical special prosecutor bristles with revulsion in his dealings with these crooks, but accepts their bribes. The filmmakers make the repressive Dewey appear particularly loathsome, a Judas whose contempt for the mob is exceeded only by his mockery of justice. Despite some flavorful dialogue, "Hoodlum" plays it straight down the line as a dramatic shoot'em up. Audiences expecting a variation on Eddie Murphy's "Harlem Nights" may leave this Fishburne film disappointed. Although it's no "Godfather," "Hoodlum" is definitely above-average and far beyond those 1970s camp classics that headlined Fred Williamson as the black Caesar of crime in "Hell Up in Harlem." If you enjoy gangster epics, "Hoodlum" is worth the price of admission. Some critics have savaged "Hoodlum" for its debatable morality. Ironically, Bumpy rises to the summit of his profession. At fade-out, however, Duke and Brancato show that the gangster's life is one that leaves you standing alone in the rain outside the church door without a friend.

    You people are nuts! This is just atrocious film wrecking. The script reminded me of a mad libs where instead of a noun, they just wrote curse words and racial slurs. It felt like the creators were aiming at entertaining the homeless insane demographic instead of intelligent individuals who wouldn't see straight through this malarky. But I have a story with this film that made it worth seeing. There was 7 people in the theater when we stumbled into this car wreck of a movie, my three friends, two other guys a few seats down and an African American couple in front of us. I was so offended by this film's utter lack of cohesive character plot, goals and motivations, creativity, etc., that my friends and I debated with the strangers next to us in the theater whether we should just leave and play area 51, a game we loathed! I was actually worried that because I was white, maybe the couple in front of us would think we were a bunch of racist jerks for leaving half way through, because it seemed to be really pretending that it was a powerful Black statement. Then the AA couple started laughing every time Larry Fishbourne said "N***** pennies" and we stayed. Two thirds in, all 7 of us turned it into a MST3K episode. We were laughing at every other line, inserting show tunes at inappropriate moments and would loudly boo and call the actors names any time the pennies were mentioned. I never would have done this had the AA dude not started throwing Junior Mints at the screen. All in all, terribly wooden acting, eerily clean set design for the 30's, bizarre and frustratingly convoluted plot and lame ass action. But hilarious theater experience.

    Bill Duke has made some great movies like Sister Act 2, Deep Cover, A Rage In Harlem etc and I'd like to see more movies from him. But I also understand that before that happens you will see more films from Uwe Boll and Quentin Tarantino(the most overrated director in the world!). This movie might not have won any awards or gotten praise by these high brow snobs and the trend-following puppets that run amok on IMDb but its still an excellent piece of work directed by Bill Duke(who stared in Commando, Predator, Exit Wounds, National Security and Busta Rhymes' Dangerous video) with excellent performances from an all-star cast. Set in the Depression Era of 1930s Harlem, The only way people could make money was through the "Numbers racket which is ran by Stephanie St. Clair(Cicely Tyson) also known as " The Queen". An arrogant and brash gangster called Dutch Schultz wants to take control of the numbers game and ends up bumping heads with Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson(Laurence Fishburne) who is just released from jail. These two get into a series of wars and everything starts to get out of control. Laurence Fishburne as well as Tim Roth were great in this film. Andy Garcia played it mellow as Lucky Luciano but he was better here than he was in 8 Million Ways To Die. There are also some solid performances here by Cicely Tyson, Loretta Devine, Chi Mcbride(Illinois) and Vanessa Williams(Bumpy's love interest). As far as complaints I have none. Hoodlum is well written and well acted. It pays homage to gangsters but doesn't glorify them. I tip my hat of to Bill Duke for this one. Two thumbs up as high up as they can go.

    Hoodlum is the story black a black underclass gangster who stands toe-to-toe with the Italian and Jewish Mafia in Harlem during 1930's in the great depression era. I checked out the story from watching the movie on Sunday and what I can say that yes there were several factual occurrences that took place during that time, however Hoodlum ends up turning its-self into some sort action flick rather than a factual account of what really happened, having said that it is still a very entertaining movie to watch and has some good performances as well as well made action scenes. Laurence Fishburne was excellent as the charming, and wise Bumpy Johnson who shows us an educated black man not afraid to stand up for what he believes in, Tim Roth was excellent as the unstable Ducth Schultz although I found my-self comparing him to Joe Pesci at times , and Andy Garcia as Lucy Lucoina was good with his screen time however I felt the stand out performance was Cicley Tyson who portrayed a very strong, elegant , proud Black woman. The movie rolled on fast and got into the swing straight away , there was good use of make-up , wardrobe and scenery which gave us a feel of 1930's Harlem. The interaction between characters is good as it gives us a real feel of what life was like back then. However the problems with Hoodlum are that the script seems a little superficial and characters which can have real depth to them normal end up being well quite flat. The film was supposed to be about real life events but it just seems to way to far fetched to the point where it does feel like a no brain action movie and the action it-self seems to be tit-for-tat repetitive although Fishburane's performance keeps you guessing how will he strike back and thusly the second half of the movie just feels messy and rushed. To conclude Hoodlum is probably not one of the best gangster movies about the black era to come I mean it is over shadowed by the likes of American Gangster but it does however manage to entertain on a big scale and is not a waste of time , its just a shame with a few clear faults in it however I would recommend as a rental and worth a check out for fans of the gangster genre. HOODLUM : 8.1 OUT OF 10 POWER IS MEASURED IN ENEMIES...

    A pretty good "old mobs" mafia picture, this time with a black gang in the forefront, which is a breath of fresh air. The cast is good, with the exception of Vanessa Williams who is blah; here's a fixed-my-nose Miss-America-Contest winner that both sings and acts; clearly she has been allowed by too many casting and record-company bozos to overstretch her limited talents. Talk about the legendary Hollywood "casting couch"! Tim Roth takes a while to get used to, with his phony New Yoyk accent; casting an Englishman, even one as terrific as Roth, to play a 30s NY mobster with a heavy accent is definitely what I would call unnecessary  to put it mildly. There are plenty of interesting twists and turns and goings-on, including good action scenes. However, a couple of them weren't too credible; firstly, the assassination attempt at Fishburne was far-fetched, and, secondly, Roth's death is too unrealistic and over-the-top. When one compares this movie's Schultz and Luciano, and the way they were shown in "Billy Bathgate", then one has to wonder which is more accurate, since the two sets of portrayals tend to differ. But considering they're both Hollywood version, both I assume are way off the mark, as entertaining as the movies may be.

    I would highly recommend the movie. I am not a big fan of gangster movies but this one it's much larger than that. I was browsing through my cable channels, stumbled on it and got hooked right away. The performances are awesome, the directing excellent, the costumes & sets perfect. And the story, well...true. That's what makes the movie even more attractive. The reason I am posting this comment - I've never done it before - is because I got irritated by critics' opinion about it. I am no movie expert, but to trash this one it's just plain or deliberate oversight. Please don't skip the movie just because somebody else tells you so. Give it a shot and you won't regret it. I promise.

    Director Bill Duke is attempting a grand gangster movie, but really don't have the skills of a master filmmaker to pull it off. The pace is ponderous. And even the action is unenergetic. Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) is a gang leader of 1930's Harlem whose successful 'Numbers' racket attracts ruthless Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) from downtown. Meanwhile gangland boss Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia) try to negotiate his way in. Bumpy refuses to give in, and violence ensues. There are a lot of great actors, but there are also some distracting overacting. Laurence Fishburne is great, and Tim Roth is wonderful as a bad guy. But I wouldn't recommend this even with these great actors.

    People who have seen American Gangster or are regular viewers of the TV show, Mobsters, will know who Bumpy Johnson was and know the story behind Hoodlum. For those of you who don't, Johnson was a member of an organized crime group, in Harlem, during the 1930's. He was also the man who mentored and inspired Denzel Washington's character of Frank Lucas in American Gangster. Long before that film, the story of Bumpy Johnson was told in Hoodlum. This was one of those little told stories about the mafia that started out very strong. Unfortunately, I felt that the writers went into far too much detail at certain points in the film and by the end it was definitely dragging on. Laurence Fishburne stars as Johnson and did an adequate job, my problem with his has always been he lacks emotion in his acting. In my humble opinion this should automatically disqualify him from certain things and this probably should have been one of those things. Tim Roth is Dutch Schultz and while Schultz had a reputation for being a character, Roth went a little over the top with it, but was still very entertaining. My favorite performance was of course the one by Andy Garcia as Lucky Luciano, but he really wasn't in the film much and that's a shame, because nobody plays a crime boss better than hen does. Hoodlum is a wild ride about an incredible true story, but as a film, it was a mix of terrific scenes and some slower unnecessary elements. As a film it's not the best, but it's worth watching just for the amazing story that is being told.

    This is a movie set in the 1930's in Harlem. It is the height of the depression and a Negro, Bumpy Johnson, has just been released from gaol. He returns to find that the Queen's gambling racket is being threatened by a white man from downtown. Everybody in Harlem is happy with the way things are - people play the numbers game and win enough to put food on the table. But numbers is a very big business and the mafia wants a piece of it. The mafia boss of the time, Lucky Lucino, is content to let it go, but one of his underlings wants a piece of the action and soon a gang war breaks out. This is the typical inter-war style movie with corrupt cops and politicians and crime running rife. The prohibition years are over, but people are making money now by other rackets, and the American system of brutal monopoly is leaving blood on the streets and the corrupt politicians are supporting those who have the most money. It is a time of lawlessness and strife, and in a way we should feel glad we don't live there. Another thing about the time is that the Negro is still very much in the underclass and there is a lot of prejudice and tension between the races. The major theme here is how power corrupts. The Queen is taken to gaol and she gives Bumpy the business to run. Bumpy is a very intelligent man, but he is also very stubborn. He refuses to give into the non-Negros and will continue to fight until one is dead. Unfortunately his stubbornness brings about the death of many innocent people. During this time, his girlfriend walks out on him, and his cousin begins to disown him, yet he refuses to give in because he believes he is right. This movie really looks at the tragedy of this, but it is not that tragic because Bumpy soon sees how he has changed and will begin to change before it is too late. But then with the death of his cousin, one can argue it is too late. His girlfriend has left, and chastises him for being so stubborn that he refuses to step into a church to pay respects for one of the dead. He finally steps into a church to pay respect to his cousin, and then walks straight out. As such we see the beginning of a change, but we don't follow through with it. The problems have been solved, and Harlem has its autonomy - what happens to Bumpy in the future is for the future.

    Interesting film about the rise of Ellsworth "Bumpy" Morgan portrayed by Lauwrence Fishburn and the fall of "Dutch" Schultz portrayed by Tim Roth. My preference goes to the Dustin Hoffman version of "Dutch" Schultz in the more accurate rendering featured in "Billy Bathgate". "Hoodlum" falls short when they showcase Dutch being hit by his own henchman in the restaurant bathroom while in "Billy Bathgate" they get it historically right as Dutch's gang (five men) are wiped out in the restaurant by "Lucky" Luciano's gang. Hoodlum may fall short on accuracy but keeps the viewer on their toes as to what happens next. Probably one of the most accurate films I have ever seen was Rod Stieger's performance in "Al Capone".

Although "Hoodlum" boasts a top-drawer cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Vanessa Williams, Tim Roth, and Andy Garcia, this lavishly mounted but uneven gangster saga suffers from its rambling length, garrulous script and a shortage of shoot-outs. As the first major film to headline the crimes of Harlem's infamous Black Godfather Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson, this production offers a novel departure for audiences that are weary of superheroes, female warriors and hard-bitten cops who have were crowding the big-screen when "Hoodlum" appeared in 1997. The Chris Brancato screenplay introduces Bumpy in 1934 as he exits Sing Sing Prison. Duke and Brancato exert great pains to differentiate Bumpy from the typical African-American mobster.

The Dutchman craves to absorb the territory that the Madam has struggled for a decade to build into the number one home-grown Harlem business. Bumpy vows to prevent any takeover by the Irish mob.

I checked out the story from watching the movie on Sunday and what I can say that yes there were several factual occurrences that took place during that time, however Hoodlum ends up turning its-self into some sort action flick rather than a factual account of what really happened, having said that it is still a very entertaining movie to watch and has some good performances as well as well made action scenes. Laurence Fishburne was excellent as the charming, and wise Bumpy Johnson who shows us an educated black man not afraid to stand up for what he believes in, Tim Roth was excellent as the unstable Ducth Schultz although I found my-self comparing him to Joe Pesci at times , and Andy Garcia as Lucy Lucoina was good with his screen time however I felt the stand out performance was Cicley Tyson who portrayed a very strong, elegant , proud Black woman. The movie rolled on fast and got into the swing straight away , there was good use of make-up , wardrobe and scenery which gave us a feel of 1930's Harlem. The interaction between characters is good as it gives us a real feel of what life was like back then. However the problems with Hoodlum are that the script seems a little superficial and characters which can have real depth to them normal end up being well quite flat. The film was supposed to be about real life events but it just seems to way to far fetched to the point where it does feel like a no brain action movie and the action it-self seems to be tit-for-tat repetitive although Fishburane's performance keeps you guessing how will he strike back and thusly the second half of the movie just feels messy and rushed. To conclude Hoodlum is probably not one of the best gangster movies about the black era to come I mean it is over shadowed by the likes of American Gangster but it does however manage to entertain on a big scale and is not a waste of time , its just a shame with a few clear faults in it however I would recommend as a rental and worth a check out for fans of the gangster genre.

    A pretty good "old mobs" mafia picture, this time with a black gang in the forefront, which is a breath of fresh air. The cast is good, with the exception of Vanessa Williams who is blah; here's a fixed-my-nose Miss-America-Contest winner that both sings and acts; clearly she has been allowed by too many casting and record-company bozos to overstretch her limited talents. Talk about the legendary Hollywood "casting couch"! Tim Roth takes a while to get used to, with his phony New Yoyk accent; casting an Englishman, even one as terrific as Roth, to play a 30s NY mobster with a heavy accent is definitely what I would call unnecessary  to put it mildly. There are plenty of interesting twists and turns and goings-on, including good action scenes. However, a couple of them weren't too credible; firstly, the assassination attempt at Fishburne was far-fetched, and, secondly, Roth's death is too unrealistic and over-the-top. When one compares this movie's Schultz and Luciano, and the way they were shown in "Billy Bathgate", then one has to wonder which is more accurate, since the two sets of portrayals tend to differ. But considering they're both Hollywood version, both I assume are way off the mark, as entertaining as the movies may be.

    I would highly recommend the movie. I am not a big fan of gangster movies but this one it's much larger than that. I was browsing through my cable channels, stumbled on it and got hooked right away. The performances are awesome, the directing excellent, the costumes & sets perfect. And the story, well...true. That's what makes the movie even more attractive. The reason I am posting this comment - I've never done it before - is because I got irritated by critics' opinion about it. I am no movie expert, but to trash this one it's just plain or deliberate oversight. Please don't skip the movie just because somebody else tells you so. Give it a shot and you won't regret it. I promise.
