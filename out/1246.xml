    Ever since I was a kid, I've loved this movie. It has a great storyline about an average delivery guy named Max Grabelski who soon becomes a fugitive in a murder case. The police think he killed a millionaire named Reinhart Bragden. He finds out that another package is supposed to be delivered to Mr. Bragden on a mountain called Devil's Peak. On the way there, he wants to prove his innocence, but he is mistaken for a great Scout leader and is forced to take Troop 12 of the Ranger Scouts on an overnight in the woods. Soon, the FBI and Scout Leader Erickson are hot on his trail. Along the way, he begins to care for the kids, and wants to help them get their badges. I highly recommend BUSHWHACKED!!!

    A harmless misfit who's on the run after being in the wrong place at the wrong time, is mistaken as an experienced boys scouts leader who was hired to bring a group of youth's on a hiking-trip. Hoping to divert the attention from himself by concealing his identity and reckoning it would be an "easy" escape-route, he decides to play along with it. However, he gets more than he bargained for when he ends up on an adventure-filled scouts trip he's not likely to forget for a long time! The children are cleverer than they look and when they they stumble upon his I.D. and realise he's not who they thought he was, they take no prisoners in showing him who's boss! This is an excellent family movie with quirky humour, a fun storyline and good acting. A must see!! I absolutely loved this as a child and still do as an adult!

    I love this movie. It is one you can watch a dozen times and see something new and funny every time. Daniel Stern is simply hilarious as a framed delivery man turned scout leader. His performance is extremely funny yet believable, and his physical comedy outdoes anything of Michael Richards. If you don't believe me, take a look at the bee-hive or bridge scenes. The great thing about this film is that it requires nothing of the viewer in order for enjoyment. You do not have to follow a complex storyline, but instead, you can sit back and laugh with ease. The supporting cast is also more than adequate especially the character Milton Fishman, who offers nerdy, handbook-inspired quotes throughout.

    I like the film because it was decent and funny. The scenery shots were good and the plot was funny. The role for Stern is a whole lot different than his role in Blue Thunder! I do like him in the Home Alone movies too. I live in Alta, so I recognize the town and surrounding shots around Donner Lake and Truckee area. Pretty cool to see your hometown in a movie. By the way, the store interior is accurate and still looks like it does in the movie. As the car pulls into Alta you can see the railroad grade crossing in the background. I wonder how many shots were interrupted by trains going by.

    Daniel Stern as Max is the main character in this movie, and he's hilarious. One of the best acting performances I've ever seen. There's also a very good storyline which is surprising for a movie of this type, and the scenery is great. The casting of characters has been well done - and the characters in this movie fit their roles as good as can be. This movie is a classic in my mind, but after reading some of the other reviews, I see that unless you like Daniel Stern's act you're not going to like the movie either. Anyway, I deeply recommend you see the movie. If you're like me, you'll love it, and if not, just turn it off after 5 minutes cause it's not gonna take more than that for you to make up your mind.

    A while ago this used to be a bit funny, but now I think it is one of the stupidest kids films I have ever seen. Daniel Stern is a criminal or something running away from the police. He decides to secretly kidnap a scout group going on a woodland trip. He poses as a scout leader and looks after these kids as well as hides from the police. While he is with the kids he tells them naughty stories, gets sick with them and has to rescue them sometimes. In the end the group come back with out any injuries and the scouts believe Stern has done a good job of being a leader, even though he's a crook. In the end, he has to take absolutely all scouts on a trip. A good actor, but in the wrong film. Poor!

    Bushwacked is an excellent comedy film that stars Daniel Stern, Jon Polito, Brad Sullivan, Ann Dowd, Anthony Heald, and Tom Wood! The acting by all of these actors is very good. Stern is excellent in this film and Jon Polito also performs good. The action is really good and the beginning of the film is excellent. The movie is hilarious. I was laughing so much when I watched this film. The film is always exciting and the music is very good by Bill Conti. I noticed that Conto put a lot of his Masters of the Universe score and even a bit of John Willaims' Home Alone films music into his own score for this film. If you own the CDs and/or are familiar with the films then you will know what I mean. Watch Shakedown and compare it! If you like Daniel Stern, Jon Polito, Brad Sullivan, Tom Wood, and the rest of the cast I've mentioned above, exciting non-stop hilarious comedy films then I Strongly recommend this film!

    Before I go on about Bushwhacked I must tell you: BUSHWHACKED IS VERY UNDERRATED! I don't know what people were expecting from the movie, but I got a lot out of this movie. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and not get sick out it. I was upset reading other people's reviews for this movie. I guess they were expecting an action/adventure-triller which it isn't. It is supposed to be an adventure-comedy and that is what it feels like. It is the same genre as City Slickers. Anyways, Daniel Stern is perfect for the role of "Mad Max"! I started watching this movie since I was since it came out in 1995 (We were only 5-6 years old) and we still watch this movie. It is a classic in our minds.

    this movie is okay, its pretty cool, but nothing special you havent seen before. in fact, most anything you think of is better. karate kid, little giants, honey i shrunk the kids. this movie has dumb one liners and hijinks that have all been done before and stolen from other movies. yet daniel stern is hilarious as "mad max". i guess the question is, should you watch this movie? if your thinking about paying to see it (renting or buying)definitley not. but if you see that its on in the cable guide, it wouldnt be a bad idea to sit down and watch it if you have the time. Overall, its amusing and if your a daniel stern fan, you'll enjoy seeing him as the dimwitted troop leader.
