 <sinopse>
  The U.S. President, low in the opinion polls, gets talked into raising his popularity by trying to start a cold war against Canada.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The US economy is in a rut, and so is the president's approval rating. What we need is a good war, but the Russians aren't interested. Hey -- how about that big polite country to the north? Niagara Fall Sheriff Bud B. Boomer takes this all a bit too seriously, though.

    "Canadian Bacon", quite a shocker but not that bad. It's just weird seeing Michael Moore directing a feature film, a politically charged comedy with a stellar cast but distant from what we know he's capable of doing. He's a very opinionated guy, full of energy and with a great sense of humor, so it's frighteningly strange to see this small comedy, almost humorless despite the high caliber comedians starring in it. The premise is similarly absurd as the one from "The Mouse that Roared", but the humor and the criticism isn't repeated in here, it's lost somewhere. With the intention of boosting his popularity sky high after being considered a wimp leader who never declared any war, the U.S. president (Alan Alda) decides to declare war against Canada, believing they have secret weapons. Pressured by a failed businessman (G.D. Spradlin) whose weapons of mass destruction aren't selling anymore and he's needy of a conflict so he can sell it, the president's loyal adviser (Kevin Pollak) instigates him to attack the neighbor nation, encouraging him after a small misunderstand involving a hillbilly American sheriff (John Candy) who offended the Canadians by saying that they beer suck. Confusion formed, war declared and loads of jokes on the expense of both cultures. Canadians are presented as jolly, clean, acceptive of insults (except the one about the beer, which was considered atrocious), while Americans are presented as desperate for combat, with limited intelligence and as Canada haters. Where's the sagacity, the acid satire or the intelligence of this? Where's the masterful Moore in this, the one we get used to see while presenting facts to some, distorting them to others yet giving us a full shocking image of what's wrong with the world? Everything is reduced in being a simple-minded comedy, going for some cheap laughs, only getting some inspired moments when it makes cultural and film references, and some of the performances achieve the desired goal of causing us to laugh a little, and reflect about the part they're playing. Alda was the perfect toyed president, surrounded of intelligent and dangerous people who make things easier for him always telling what he must do. His part is what makes this movie more relevant now than when it was made in 1995. Moore was clearly foreseeing one of his favorite future targets, Bush Jr. The similarity of intent and actions are uncanny. This could be a gold material just like "Wag the Dog" or truthfully hilarious like "Bulworth". Instead it's just another forgettable movie. Among the good parts are the priceless cameo by Dan Aykroyd as an Canadian police officer who teaches sheriff Candy how things work in the country; the president quoting Bob Dylan minutes before almost getting blown up; Bill Nunn exposing why blacks are always put in second place, specially movie characters; the broadcast news anchor (Stanley Anderson) informing about the eminent war; Jim Belushi's cameo as a drunk reporter and Steven Wright's cameo. Kind of awkward when you realize the cameos were more effective than the main cast who besides Candy (sadly his last role and one of the most unfunny he ever made), Alda, Pollak, also have Rip Torn, Rhea Perlman, Kevin J. O'Connor, Wallace Shawn (cameo) and even a brief appearance by Moore himself. It has a fine amount of laughs, tiny ones. It was OK. 6/10

    This movie as absolutely delicious. The humour is so refined and the subtleties hilarious. The fun directed at Canadians is original, based on preconceptions about Canada, on presumptions, and on hearsay. All these elements are put together in a very novel way. One must be a Canadian or else have strong Canadian connections - an excellent understanding of Canada, to fully appreciate this movie. It is an excellent occasion for Canadians to have a good laugh at how they are perceived not only by Americans, but also by a lot of other nations. It appears this movie was never shown in Canadian movie theatres, and that is a real shame, because we missed out on a high quality movie. I am recommending this movie to everyone I know.

    "Surrender her pronto, or we'll level Toronto." (Reminds me of an old joke: "The Lone Ranger goes to Canada" . . . or . . "On to Toronto,Tonto, pronto!") It's probably easier for a Canadian to like this movie, and to find it funny. Allan Alda's line, above, was one of the many times I laughed out loud -- my real test for a funny movie. What it is, is, an exaggeration of the exaggerated perception that (we think) Americans have about Canada -- the cleanliness, the politeness, the accent ootandabooot etc. Plus, the portrayal of Americans looking like goofs as they stumble around and over-react to those exaggerations. Canadians understand both the substance and the hyperbole around those clich&eacute;s, and the LOLs are easy to come by. Then, of course, the movie exaggerates American clich&eacute;s also, and "everybody" loves to laugh at Americans, even though most Canadians (certaintly the ones that have visited often) have great admiration for the giant to the south, and lots of envy too. Also, lots of movie clich&eacute;s get the same satirical treatment. Hey, it's really great fun at the expense of both sides, although in different ways. I can't believe that it's Roger Moore who put it together -- most of his stuff is so heavy and self-important as to be unwatchable. (On second thought, I guess it IS typical MM -- mocking as much Americana per minute as he can) But he must have been doing different drugs when he did this mini-masterpiece. It cannot go unnoticed, of course, that John Candy, the American sheriff is/was very, very Canadian. Canadians, and Americans who know about Canada, should find this a funny movie worth their time.

    I love this movie. It cracks me up every time I watch it. One of the things I think is funny is the fact that so many Canadians appear in it--although they could be walking undetected among us Americans! The idea of Canadians' massing along the border, preparing to invade the US, is hilariously depicted by the "news media," trying to whip up anti-Canadian feeling. And, Alan Alda as the vacillating politician, with Rip Torn as his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were perfect! I enjoyed hearing the two Mounted Policemen debating about how to end a sentence without using a preposition. Their Canadian accent is more noticeable in that scene than in most others. In real life, it is interesting to consider how-different we are, even though we have so many apparent similarities. Only the Australians or Israelis are more like us Americans than are the Canadians. Yet, we are different. The scary thing is how realistic the idea of creating an enemy, where one doesn't exist may have turned out to be, as in the alleged "weapons of mass destruction" that motivated the invasion of Iraq.

    I don't write a lot of reviews, for the same reason I don't write history books; I'm not creative and verbose enough... So, I'm not sure if I will be able to fulfill the curious minimum word count that IMDb requires from anyone who wants to share a few comments about a film. However, I wish Moore would take his time, develop the ability to focus on one of clever schemes all the way though to the end, because that's all that keeps this movie from becoming a cult classic. It's clever innuendos which take aim at America's propensity to use war and other fabricated emergencies for political benefit is dead on, while also taking potshots at some of the more humorous examples of Canadian culture. Haven't heard such good needling of American policy since Will Rogers; and boy, isn't it timely. Anyway, I suggest only independent thinkers bother to watch Canadian Bacon, because the sheep who believe as they've been told to won't get it. The movie gets a seven rating and so does Michael Moore until he focuses and writes a complete script which it looks like he has the capability of doing.

    Why I liked it - * I feel there's a grain of truth in the political satire * Ties a lot of real stuff into the movie like a city's dependence on a large employer, media manipulation, American ignorance about other countries, American arrogance * Lots of funny stuff about Canada; Anne Murray, Gordon Lightfoot, CN Tower, having a John Candy a Candadian as an enemy of Canada etc. * Anne Murray's Snowbird, come on, how often you hear that song, lol Things I did not like at times - * I felt the plot could have been slightly more solid at times * Pretty much every character in the movie was an idiot; you felt like you were watched Idiocracy or something ( which IS a good movie) In general, I found the movie laugh out loud funny at times, which is the important part. Sure, it's a satire, and it's an MM satire. While you are supposed to learn something about our country while watching it, I don't think any of MM's views should be a surprise to anyone. So it works better as a comedy where we laugh at the movie, and maybe a bit at ourselves Best scenes - * Hockey arena where Candy badmouths Canada, with no one getting upset - until he says their beer sucks. Now THAT's funny, IMO * Dan Akroyd pulling Candy over, no because the truck is spray but painted with anti-Canadian sentiments, but because it's not bilingual! AND he makes him spray paint the slurs in french - Priceless

    I don't know exactly what to think of Moore's vision of the future. we must remember Michael Moore, the famous director of documentary's like Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine, wrote this story in 1995. though it must have seemed funny way back then, now it looks more like a parody of the way we live right now. but in 1995, people must have laughed with his futuristic vision. yes, it looks a bit like Dr. Strangelove, that's true. but hey, doesn't every Van Damme picture look the same? therefore, Canadian Bacon is very original (because there are not many war comedies of the same caliber as the one of DR. Strangelove). what I particular noticed while watching, was the way Moore used music to lead the audience into the direction he wanted. probably I wasn't the only one who heard the Vietnam war music, but that's not exactly what I meant. the sound that Moore uses to manipulate his audience is superb. for instance, there is the sound of beams of the copy machine when there is trouble in the war room, suggesting the audience that there is something dangerous is about to happen. so that's why I gave this movie 6 points. I could have given it 2 points too, because I liked and I did not like what I saw. see the movie and conclude for yourself.

    An American President (played by Alan Alda) is seeing his popularity ratings plummet and his chances for a second term rapidly disappearing. What to do about it? In this very funny satire, the answer, of course, is to create an enemy to whip up US public opinion in support of the start of a new Cold War. But who will it be against? The Russians are no threat anymore. Well, the obvious choice is - Canada! After all, Canada has massed 90% of its population along the border (they must be up to something!) and the Toronto Blue Jays have won the World Series - twice (and they cheated to do it!) So, "Operation Canadian Bacon" is launched! This is a great satire that pokes fun at pretty much everything and anything: Canada and Canadians, the US and Americans, international relations, arms manufacturers, etc. John Candy was brilliant as Niagara County (NY) sheriff Bud Boomer, who gets so caught up in the anti-Canadians rhetoric being spewed forth from the White House that he takes it upon himself to lead an invasion. Unfortunately, he loses one of his comrades (Honey, played by Rhea Pearlman) who gets arrested in Niagara Falls, Ont. - for littering! To the White House, Honey becomes a hostage. Troops are sent in (and Bud goes too) and the whole thing spirals into a very "serious" international incident, during which Russia almost gets nuked by accident! Candy was the perfect stereotype of the ugly American - loud, crude and totally ignorant of anything outside his own immediate circle (and pretty ignorant within that circle!) Pearlman and Alda were also quite good, and I enjoyed Bill Nunn as Deputy Kabral, another of Boomer's gang, who gripes about being determined to make Canadians "white." There was really no significant Canadian character in the movie, but a brilliant caricature by Dan Aykroyd as an Ontario police officer who pulls Boomer over while he's on his way to rescue Honey in Toronto to insist that the anti-Canadian slogans painted on his truck have to be in French as well to comply with Canadian language laws. I wouldn't say that this was outrageously funny but it was humorous throughout and completely enjoyable. A number of Canadians appear in the cast, and there's some fun poked at the fact that the entertainment industry in the US is so dominated by Canadian actors (surely a plot from up north) and also at some Canadian singers (Ann Murray, Gordon Lightfoot.) There was also a very funny spoof of the tendency of US networks to over-dramatize everything that happens ("Operation Canadian Bacon" with a crossed out maple leaf being the backdrop for an outrageous anchorman, played by Stanley Anderson.) I was surprised to see that this was directed and written by Michael Moore - and in many ways I found this far more entertaining (and effective) than the quasi-documentaries/propaganda pieces he's now more famous for, although it's somewhat low rating makes me wonder if Americans can really understand and/or appreciate both the humour and the caricatures. All in all, I found it to be good fun. 7/10

    This movie was just bloody awful. I don't even know where to begin. I feel like Michael Moore owes me an hour and a half of my life back. Moore needs to stick to doing documentaries because he obviously has no talent directing comedy. Not only was the film not funny, the production value was borderline home movie. While the premise wasn't bad the execution of it was terrible. It is kind of sad when South Park can do a better movie about invading Canada than Michael Moore. He really should be ashamed of himself for claiming to be a film maker after making such a horrible piece of dreck. This film was just a terrible from start to finish.

    There are quite a few satires out there but many have a hard time in keep up with this one. After the Cold War the Americans need a new enemy...Canada! Join John Candy and his group of northern armchair heroes as they take the battle to the Canadians in order to improve the US economy. I should say that this is a fun movie. The satire is top notch as only Micheal Moore can deliver. The interaction between characters is done very well and though a few scenes may be a little harsh politically it is still pretty funny and doesn't lean too much to the left of the political spectrum. I am sad that I didn't get to see this film any sooner. There is a fairly good cast of stars and cameos of several others. It is done well.

Strangelove). what I particular noticed while watching, was the way Moore used music to lead the audience into the direction he wanted. probably I wasn't the only one who heard the Vietnam war music, but that's not exactly what I meant. the sound that Moore uses to manipulate his audience is superb. for instance, there is the sound of beams of the copy machine when there is trouble in the war room, suggesting the audience that there is something dangerous is about to happen. so that's why I gave this movie 6 points. I could have given it 2 points too, because I liked and I did not like what I saw. see the movie and conclude for yourself.

    An American President (played by Alan Alda) is seeing his popularity ratings plummet and his chances for a second term rapidly disappearing. What to do about it? In this very funny satire, the answer, of course, is to create an enemy to whip up US public opinion in support of the start of a new Cold War. But who will it be against? The Russians are no threat anymore. Well, the obvious choice is - Canada! After all, Canada has massed 90% of its population along the border (they must be up to something!) and the Toronto Blue Jays have won the World Series - twice (and they cheated to do it!) So, "Operation Canadian Bacon" is launched! This is a great satire that pokes fun at pretty much everything and anything: Canada and Canadians, the US and Americans, international relations, arms manufacturers, etc. John Candy was brilliant as Niagara County (NY) sheriff Bud Boomer, who gets so caught up in the anti-Canadians rhetoric being spewed forth from the White House that he takes it upon himself to lead an invasion. Unfortunately, he loses one of his comrades (Honey, played by Rhea Pearlman) who gets arrested in Niagara Falls, Ont. - for littering! To the White House, Honey becomes a hostage. Troops are sent in (and Bud goes too) and the whole thing spirals into a very "serious" international incident, during which Russia almost gets nuked by accident! Candy was the perfect stereotype of the ugly American - loud, crude and totally ignorant of anything outside his own immediate circle (and pretty ignorant within that circle!) Pearlman and Alda were also quite good, and I enjoyed Bill Nunn as Deputy Kabral, another of Boomer's gang, who gripes about being determined to make Canadians "white." There was really no significant Canadian character in the movie, but a brilliant caricature by Dan Aykroyd as an Ontario police officer who pulls Boomer over while he's on his way to rescue Honey in Toronto to insist that the anti-Canadian slogans painted on his truck have to be in French as well to comply with Canadian language laws. I wouldn't say that this was outrageously funny but it was humorous throughout and completely enjoyable. A number of Canadians appear in the cast, and there's some fun poked at the fact that the entertainment industry in the US is so dominated by Canadian actors (surely a plot from up north) and also at some Canadian singers (Ann Murray, Gordon Lightfoot.) There was also a very funny spoof of the tendency of US networks to over-dramatize everything that happens ("Operation Canadian Bacon" with a crossed out maple leaf being the backdrop for an outrageous anchorman, played by Stanley Anderson.) I was surprised to see that this was directed and written by Michael Moore - and in many ways I found this far more entertaining (and effective) than the quasi-documentaries/propaganda pieces he's now more famous for, although it's somewhat low rating makes me wonder if Americans can really understand and/or appreciate both the humour and the caricatures. All in all, I found it to be good fun. 7/10

    This movie was just bloody awful. I don't even know where to begin. I feel like Michael Moore owes me an hour and a half of my life back. Moore needs to stick to doing documentaries because he obviously has no talent directing comedy. Not only was the film not funny, the production value was borderline home movie. While the premise wasn't bad the execution of it was terrible. It is kind of sad when South Park can do a better movie about invading Canada than Michael Moore. He really should be ashamed of himself for claiming to be a film maker after making such a horrible piece of dreck. This film was just a terrible from start to finish.

    There are quite a few satires out there but many have a hard time in keep up with this one. After the Cold War the Americans need a new enemy...Canada! Join John Candy and his group of northern armchair heroes as they take the battle to the Canadians in order to improve the US economy. I should say that this is a fun movie. The satire is top notch as only Micheal Moore can deliver. The interaction between characters is done very well and though a few scenes may be a little harsh politically it is still pretty funny and doesn't lean too much to the left of the political spectrum. I am sad that I didn't get to see this film any sooner. There is a fairly good cast of stars and cameos of several others. It is done well.

    "Canadian Bacon", quite a shocker but not that bad. It's just weird seeing Michael Moore directing a feature film, a politically charged comedy with a stellar cast but distant from what we know he's capable of doing. He's a very opinionated guy, full of energy and with a great sense of humor, so it's frighteningly strange to see this small comedy, almost humorless despite the high caliber comedians starring in it. The premise is similarly absurd as the one from "The Mouse that Roared", but the humor and the criticism isn't repeated in here, it's lost somewhere. With the intention of boosting his popularity sky high after being considered a wimp leader who never declared any war, the U.S. president (Alan Alda) decides to declare war against Canada, believing they have secret weapons. Pressured by a failed businessman (G.D. Spradlin) whose weapons of mass destruction aren't selling anymore and he's needy of a conflict so he can sell it, the president's loyal adviser (Kevin Pollak) instigates him to attack the neighbor nation, encouraging him after a small misunderstand involving a hillbilly American sheriff (John Candy) who offended the Canadians by saying that they beer suck. Confusion formed, war declared and loads of jokes on the expense of both cultures. Canadians are presented as jolly, clean, acceptive of insults (except the one about the beer, which was considered atrocious), while Americans are presented as desperate for combat, with limited intelligence and as Canada haters. Where's the sagacity, the acid satire or the intelligence of this? Where's the masterful Moore in this, the one we get used to see while presenting facts to some, distorting them to others yet giving us a full shocking image of what's wrong with the world? Everything is reduced in being a simple-minded comedy, going for some cheap laughs, only getting some inspired moments when it makes cultural and film references, and some of the performances achieve the desired goal of causing us to laugh a little, and reflect about the part they're playing. Alda was the perfect toyed president, surrounded of intelligent and dangerous people who make things easier for him always telling what he must do. His part is what makes this movie more relevant now than when it was made in 1995. Moore was clearly foreseeing one of his favorite future targets, Bush Jr. The similarity of intent and actions are uncanny. This could be a gold material just like "Wag the Dog" or truthfully hilarious like "Bulworth". Instead it's just another forgettable movie. Among the good parts are the priceless cameo by Dan Aykroyd as an Canadian police officer who teaches sheriff Candy how things work in the country; the president quoting Bob Dylan minutes before almost getting blown up; Bill Nunn exposing why blacks are always put in second place, specially movie characters; the broadcast news anchor (Stanley Anderson) informing about the eminent war; Jim Belushi's cameo as a drunk reporter and Steven Wright's cameo. Kind of awkward when you realize the cameos were more effective than the main cast who besides Candy (sadly his last role and one of the most unfunny he ever made), Alda, Pollak, also have Rip Torn, Rhea Perlman, Kevin J. O'Connor, Wallace Shawn (cameo) and even a brief appearance by Moore himself. It has a fine amount of laughs, tiny ones. It was OK. 6/10

    This movie as absolutely delicious. The humour is so refined and the subtleties hilarious. The fun directed at Canadians is original, based on preconceptions about Canada, on presumptions, and on hearsay. All these elements are put together in a very novel way. One must be a Canadian or else have strong Canadian connections - an excellent understanding of Canada, to fully appreciate this movie. It is an excellent occasion for Canadians to have a good laugh at how they are perceived not only by Americans, but also by a lot of other nations. It appears this movie was never shown in Canadian movie theatres, and that is a real shame, because we missed out on a high quality movie. I am recommending this movie to everyone I know.

    "Surrender her pronto, or we'll level Toronto." (Reminds me of an old joke: "The Lone Ranger goes to Canada" . . . or . . "On to Toronto,Tonto, pronto!") It's probably easier for a Canadian to like this movie, and to find it funny. Allan Alda's line, above, was one of the many times I laughed out loud -- my real test for a funny movie. What it is, is, an exaggeration of the exaggerated perception that (we think) Americans have about Canada -- the cleanliness, the politeness, the accent ootandabooot etc. Plus, the portrayal of Americans looking like goofs as they stumble around and over-react to those exaggerations. Canadians understand both the substance and the hyperbole around those clich&eacute;s, and the LOLs are easy to come by. Then, of course, the movie exaggerates American clich&eacute;s also, and "everybody" loves to laugh at Americans, even though most Canadians (certaintly the ones that have visited often) have great admiration for the giant to the south, and lots of envy too. Also, lots of movie clich&eacute;s get the same satirical treatment. Hey, it's really great fun at the expense of both sides, although in different ways. I can't believe that it's Roger Moore who put it together -- most of his stuff is so heavy and self-important as to be unwatchable. (On second thought, I guess it IS typical MM -- mocking as much Americana per minute as he can) But he must have been doing different drugs when he did this mini-masterpiece. It cannot go unnoticed, of course, that John Candy, the American sheriff is/was very, very Canadian. Canadians, and Americans who know about Canada, should find this a funny movie worth their time.

    I love this movie. It cracks me up every time I watch it. One of the things I think is funny is the fact that so many Canadians appear in it--although they could be walking undetected among us Americans! The idea of Canadians' massing along the border, preparing to invade the US, is hilariously depicted by the "news media," trying to whip up anti-Canadian feeling. And, Alan Alda as the vacillating politician, with Rip Torn as his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were perfect! I enjoyed hearing the two Mounted Policemen debating about how to end a sentence without using a preposition. Their Canadian accent is more noticeable in that scene than in most others. In real life, it is interesting to consider how-different we are, even though we have so many apparent similarities. Only the Australians or Israelis are more like us Americans than are the Canadians. Yet, we are different. The scary thing is how realistic the idea of creating an enemy, where one doesn't exist may have turned out to be, as in the alleged "weapons of mass destruction" that motivated the invasion of Iraq.

    I don't write a lot of reviews, for the same reason I don't write history books; I'm not creative and verbose enough... So, I'm not sure if I will be able to fulfill the curious minimum word count that IMDb requires from anyone who wants to share a few comments about a film. However, I wish Moore would take his time, develop the ability to focus on one of clever schemes all the way though to the end, because that's all that keeps this movie from becoming a cult classic. It's clever innuendos which take aim at America's propensity to use war and other fabricated emergencies for political benefit is dead on, while also taking potshots at some of the more humorous examples of Canadian culture. Haven't heard such good needling of American policy since Will Rogers; and boy, isn't it timely. Anyway, I suggest only independent thinkers bother to watch Canadian Bacon, because the sheep who believe as they've been told to won't get it. The movie gets a seven rating and so does Michael Moore until he focuses and writes a complete script which it looks like he has the capability of doing.

    Why I liked it - * I feel there's a grain of truth in the political satire * Ties a lot of real stuff into the movie like a city's dependence on a large employer, media manipulation, American ignorance about other countries, American arrogance * Lots of funny stuff about Canada; Anne Murray, Gordon Lightfoot, CN Tower, having a John Candy a Candadian as an enemy of Canada etc. * Anne Murray's Snowbird, come on, how often you hear that song, lol Things I did not like at times - * I felt the plot could have been slightly more solid at times * Pretty much every character in the movie was an idiot; you felt like you were watched Idiocracy or something ( which IS a good movie) In general, I found the movie laugh out loud funny at times, which is the important part. Sure, it's a satire, and it's an MM satire. While you are supposed to learn something about our country while watching it, I don't think any of MM's views should be a surprise to anyone. So it works better as a comedy where we laugh at the movie, and maybe a bit at ourselves Best scenes - * Hockey arena where Candy badmouths Canada, with no one getting upset - until he says their beer sucks. Now THAT's funny, IMO * Dan Akroyd pulling Candy over, no because the truck is spray but painted with anti-Canadian sentiments, but because it's not bilingual! AND he makes him spray paint the slurs in french - Priceless

    I don't write a lot of reviews, for the same reason I don't write history books; I'm not creative and verbose enough... So, I'm not sure if I will be able to fulfill the curious minimum word count that IMDb requires from anyone who wants to share a few comments about a film. However, I wish Moore would take his time, develop the ability to focus on one of clever schemes all the way though to the end, because that's all that keeps this movie from becoming a cult classic. It's clever innuendos which take aim at America's propensity to use war and other fabricated emergencies for political benefit is dead on, while also taking potshots at some of the more humorous examples of Canadian culture. Haven't heard such good needling of American policy since Will Rogers; and boy, isn't it timely. Anyway, I suggest only independent thinkers bother to watch Canadian Bacon, because the sheep who believe as they've been told to won't get it. The movie gets a seven rating and so does Michael Moore until he focuses and writes a complete script which it looks like he has the capability of doing.

    Why I liked it - * I feel there's a grain of truth in the political satire * Ties a lot of real stuff into the movie like a city's dependence on a large employer, media manipulation, American ignorance about other countries, American arrogance * Lots of funny stuff about Canada; Anne Murray, Gordon Lightfoot, CN Tower, having a John Candy a Candadian as an enemy of Canada etc. * Anne Murray's Snowbird, come on, how often you hear that song, lol Things I did not like at times - * I felt the plot could have been slightly more solid at times * Pretty much every character in the movie was an idiot; you felt like you were watched Idiocracy or something ( which IS a good movie) In general, I found the movie laugh out loud funny at times, which is the important part. Sure, it's a satire, and it's an MM satire. While you are supposed to learn something about our country while watching it, I don't think any of MM's views should be a surprise to anyone. So it works better as a comedy where we laugh at the movie, and maybe a bit at ourselves Best scenes - * Hockey arena where Candy badmouths Canada, with no one getting upset - until he says their beer sucks. Now THAT's funny, IMO * Dan Akroyd pulling Candy over, no because the truck is spray but painted with anti-Canadian sentiments, but because it's not bilingual! AND he makes him spray paint the slurs in french - Priceless

    I don't know exactly what to think of Moore's vision of the future. we must remember Michael Moore, the famous director of documentary's like Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine, wrote this story in 1995. though it must have seemed funny way back then, now it looks more like a parody of the way we live right now. but in 1995, people must have laughed with his futuristic vision. yes, it looks a bit like Dr. Strangelove, that's true. but hey, doesn't every Van Damme picture look the same? therefore, Canadian Bacon is very original (because there are not many war comedies of the same caliber as the one of DR. Strangelove). what I particular noticed while watching, was the way Moore used music to lead the audience into the direction he wanted. probably I wasn't the only one who heard the Vietnam war music, but that's not exactly what I meant. the sound that Moore uses to manipulate his audience is superb. for instance, there is the sound of beams of the copy machine when there is trouble in the war room, suggesting the audience that there is something dangerous is about to happen. so that's why I gave this movie 6 points. I could have given it 2 points too, because I liked and I did not like what I saw. see the movie and conclude for yourself.

    An American President (played by Alan Alda) is seeing his popularity ratings plummet and his chances for a second term rapidly disappearing. What to do about it? In this very funny satire, the answer, of course, is to create an enemy to whip up US public opinion in support of the start of a new Cold War. But who will it be against? The Russians are no threat anymore. Well, the obvious choice is - Canada! After all, Canada has massed 90% of its population along the border (they must be up to something!) and the Toronto Blue Jays have won the World Series - twice (and they cheated to do it!) So, "Operation Canadian Bacon" is launched! This is a great satire that pokes fun at pretty much everything and anything: Canada and Canadians, the US and Americans, international relations, arms manufacturers, etc. John Candy was brilliant as Niagara County (NY) sheriff Bud Boomer, who gets so caught up in the anti-Canadians rhetoric being spewed forth from the White House that he takes it upon himself to lead an invasion. Unfortunately, he loses one of his comrades (Honey, played by Rhea Pearlman) who gets arrested in Niagara Falls, Ont. - for littering! To the White House, Honey becomes a hostage. Troops are sent in (and Bud goes too) and the whole thing spirals into a very "serious" international incident, during which Russia almost gets nuked by accident! Candy was the perfect stereotype of the ugly American - loud, crude and totally ignorant of anything outside his own immediate circle (and pretty ignorant within that circle!) Pearlman and Alda were also quite good, and I enjoyed Bill Nunn as Deputy Kabral, another of Boomer's gang, who gripes about being determined to make Canadians "white." There was really no significant Canadian character in the movie, but a brilliant caricature by Dan Aykroyd as an Ontario police officer who pulls Boomer over while he's on his way to rescue Honey in Toronto to insist that the anti-Canadian slogans painted on his truck have to be in French as well to comply with Canadian language laws. I wouldn't say that this was outrageously funny but it was humorous throughout and completely enjoyable. A number of Canadians appear in the cast, and there's some fun poked at the fact that the entertainment industry in the US is so dominated by Canadian actors (surely a plot from up north) and also at some Canadian singers (Ann Murray, Gordon Lightfoot.) There was also a very funny spoof of the tendency of US networks to over-dramatize everything that happens ("Operation Canadian Bacon" with a crossed out maple leaf being the backdrop for an outrageous anchorman, played by Stanley Anderson.) I was surprised to see that this was directed and written by Michael Moore - and in many ways I found this far more entertaining (and effective) than the quasi-documentaries/propaganda pieces he's now more famous for, although it's somewhat low rating makes me wonder if Americans can really understand and/or appreciate both the humour and the caricatures. All in all, I found it to be good fun. 7/10

    This movie was just bloody awful. I don't even know where to begin. I feel like Michael Moore owes me an hour and a half of my life back. Moore needs to stick to doing documentaries because he obviously has no talent directing comedy. Not only was the film not funny, the production value was borderline home movie. While the premise wasn't bad the execution of it was terrible. It is kind of sad when South Park can do a better movie about invading Canada than Michael Moore. He really should be ashamed of himself for claiming to be a film maker after making such a horrible piece of dreck. This film was just a terrible from start to finish.

    There are quite a few satires out there but many have a hard time in keep up with this one. After the Cold War the Americans need a new enemy...Canada! Join John Candy and his group of northern armchair heroes as they take the battle to the Canadians in order to improve the US economy. I should say that this is a fun movie. The satire is top notch as only Micheal Moore can deliver. The interaction between characters is done very well and though a few scenes may be a little harsh politically it is still pretty funny and doesn't lean too much to the left of the political spectrum. I am sad that I didn't get to see this film any sooner. There is a fairly good cast of stars and cameos of several others. It is done well.

    "Canadian Bacon", quite a shocker but not that bad. It's just weird seeing Michael Moore directing a feature film, a politically charged comedy with a stellar cast but distant from what we know he's capable of doing. He's a very opinionated guy, full of energy and with a great sense of humor, so it's frighteningly strange to see this small comedy, almost humorless despite the high caliber comedians starring in it. The premise is similarly absurd as the one from "The Mouse that Roared", but the humor and the criticism isn't repeated in here, it's lost somewhere. With the intention of boosting his popularity sky high after being considered a wimp leader who never declared any war, the U.S. president (Alan Alda) decides to declare war against Canada, believing they have secret weapons. Pressured by a failed businessman (G.D. Spradlin) whose weapons of mass destruction aren't selling anymore and he's needy of a conflict so he can sell it, the president's loyal adviser (Kevin Pollak) instigates him to attack the neighbor nation, encouraging him after a small misunderstand involving a hillbilly American sheriff (John Candy) who offended the Canadians by saying that they beer suck. Confusion formed, war declared and loads of jokes on the expense of both cultures. Canadians are presented as jolly, clean, acceptive of insults (except the one about the beer, which was considered atrocious), while Americans are presented as desperate for combat, with limited intelligence and as Canada haters. Where's the sagacity, the acid satire or the intelligence of this? Where's the masterful Moore in this, the one we get used to see while presenting facts to some, distorting them to others yet giving us a full shocking image of what's wrong with the world? Everything is reduced in being a simple-minded comedy, going for some cheap laughs, only getting some inspired moments when it makes cultural and film references, and some of the performances achieve the desired goal of causing us to laugh a little, and reflect about the part they're playing. Alda was the perfect toyed president, surrounded of intelligent and dangerous people who make things easier for him always telling what he must do. His part is what makes this movie more relevant now than when it was made in 1995. Moore was clearly foreseeing one of his favorite future targets, Bush Jr. The similarity of intent and actions are uncanny. This could be a gold material just like "Wag the Dog" or truthfully hilarious like "Bulworth". Instead it's just another forgettable movie. Among the good parts are the priceless cameo by Dan Aykroyd as an Canadian police officer who teaches sheriff Candy how things work in the country; the president quoting Bob Dylan minutes before almost getting blown up; Bill Nunn exposing why blacks are always put in second place, specially movie characters; the broadcast news anchor (Stanley Anderson) informing about the eminent war; Jim Belushi's cameo as a drunk reporter and Steven Wright's cameo. Kind of awkward when you realize the cameos were more effective than the main cast who besides Candy (sadly his last role and one of the most unfunny he ever made), Alda, Pollak, also have Rip Torn, Rhea Perlman, Kevin J. O'Connor, Wallace Shawn (cameo) and even a brief appearance by Moore himself. It has a fine amount of laughs, tiny ones. It was OK. 6/10

    This movie as absolutely delicious. The humour is so refined and the subtleties hilarious. The fun directed at Canadians is original, based on preconceptions about Canada, on presumptions, and on hearsay. All these elements are put together in a very novel way. One must be a Canadian or else have strong Canadian connections - an excellent understanding of Canada, to fully appreciate this movie. It is an excellent occasion for Canadians to have a good laugh at how they are perceived not only by Americans, but also by a lot of other nations. It appears this movie was never shown in Canadian movie theatres, and that is a real shame, because we missed out on a high quality movie. I am recommending this movie to everyone I know.

    "Surrender her pronto, or we'll level Toronto." (Reminds me of an old joke: "The Lone Ranger goes to Canada" . . . or . . "On to Toronto,Tonto, pronto!") It's probably easier for a Canadian to like this movie, and to find it funny. Allan Alda's line, above, was one of the many times I laughed out loud -- my real test for a funny movie. What it is, is, an exaggeration of the exaggerated perception that (we think) Americans have about Canada -- the cleanliness, the politeness, the accent ootandabooot etc. Plus, the portrayal of Americans looking like goofs as they stumble around and over-react to those exaggerations. Canadians understand both the substance and the hyperbole around those clich&eacute;s, and the LOLs are easy to come by. Then, of course, the movie exaggerates American clich&eacute;s also, and "everybody" loves to laugh at Americans, even though most Canadians (certaintly the ones that have visited often) have great admiration for the giant to the south, and lots of envy too. Also, lots of movie clich&eacute;s get the same satirical treatment. Hey, it's really great fun at the expense of both sides, although in different ways. I can't believe that it's Roger Moore who put it together -- most of his stuff is so heavy and self-important as to be unwatchable. (On second thought, I guess it IS typical MM -- mocking as much Americana per minute as he can) But he must have been doing different drugs when he did this mini-masterpiece. It cannot go unnoticed, of course, that John Candy, the American sheriff is/was very, very Canadian. Canadians, and Americans who know about Canada, should find this a funny movie worth their time.

    I love this movie. It cracks me up every time I watch it. One of the things I think is funny is the fact that so many Canadians appear in it--although they could be walking undetected among us Americans! The idea of Canadians' massing along the border, preparing to invade the US, is hilariously depicted by the "news media," trying to whip up anti-Canadian feeling. And, Alan Alda as the vacillating politician, with Rip Torn as his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were perfect! I enjoyed hearing the two Mounted Policemen debating about how to end a sentence without using a preposition. Their Canadian accent is more noticeable in that scene than in most others. In real life, it is interesting to consider how-different we are, even though we have so many apparent similarities. Only the Australians or Israelis are more like us Americans than are the Canadians. Yet, we are different. The scary thing is how realistic the idea of creating an enemy, where one doesn't exist may have turned out to be, as in the alleged "weapons of mass destruction" that motivated the invasion of Iraq.

    "Surrender her pronto, or we'll level Toronto." (Reminds me of an old joke: "The Lone Ranger goes to Canada" . . . or . . "On to Toronto,Tonto, pronto!") It's probably easier for a Canadian to like this movie, and to find it funny. Allan Alda's line, above, was one of the many times I laughed out loud -- my real test for a funny movie. What it is, is, an exaggeration of the exaggerated perception that (we think) Americans have about Canada -- the cleanliness, the politeness, the accent ootandabooot etc. Plus, the portrayal of Americans looking like goofs as they stumble around and over-react to those exaggerations. Canadians understand both the substance and the hyperbole around those clich&eacute;s, and the LOLs are easy to come by. Then, of course, the movie exaggerates American clich&eacute;s also, and "everybody" loves to laugh at Americans, even though most Canadians (certaintly the ones that have visited often) have great admiration for the giant to the south, and lots of envy too. Also, lots of movie clich&eacute;s get the same satirical treatment. Hey, it's really great fun at the expense of both sides, although in different ways. I can't believe that it's Roger Moore who put it together -- most of his stuff is so heavy and self-important as to be unwatchable. (On second thought, I guess it IS typical MM -- mocking as much Americana per minute as he can) But he must have been doing different drugs when he did this mini-masterpiece. It cannot go unnoticed, of course, that John Candy, the American sheriff is/was very, very Canadian. Canadians, and Americans who know about Canada, should find this a funny movie worth their time.

    I love this movie. It cracks me up every time I watch it. One of the things I think is funny is the fact that so many Canadians appear in it--although they could be walking undetected among us Americans! The idea of Canadians' massing along the border, preparing to invade the US, is hilariously depicted by the "news media," trying to whip up anti-Canadian feeling. And, Alan Alda as the vacillating politician, with Rip Torn as his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were perfect! I enjoyed hearing the two Mounted Policemen debating about how to end a sentence without using a preposition. Their Canadian accent is more noticeable in that scene than in most others. In real life, it is interesting to consider how-different we are, even though we have so many apparent similarities. Only the Australians or Israelis are more like us Americans than are the Canadians. Yet, we are different. The scary thing is how realistic the idea of creating an enemy, where one doesn't exist may have turned out to be, as in the alleged "weapons of mass destruction" that motivated the invasion of Iraq.

    I don't write a lot of reviews, for the same reason I don't write history books; I'm not creative and verbose enough... So, I'm not sure if I will be able to fulfill the curious minimum word count that IMDb requires from anyone who wants to share a few comments about a film. However, I wish Moore would take his time, develop the ability to focus on one of clever schemes all the way though to the end, because that's all that keeps this movie from becoming a cult classic. It's clever innuendos which take aim at America's propensity to use war and other fabricated emergencies for political benefit is dead on, while also taking potshots at some of the more humorous examples of Canadian culture. Haven't heard such good needling of American policy since Will Rogers; and boy, isn't it timely. Anyway, I suggest only independent thinkers bother to watch Canadian Bacon, because the sheep who believe as they've been told to won't get it. The movie gets a seven rating and so does Michael Moore until he focuses and writes a complete script which it looks like he has the capability of doing.

    Why I liked it - * I feel there's a grain of truth in the political satire * Ties a lot of real stuff into the movie like a city's dependence on a large employer, media manipulation, American ignorance about other countries, American arrogance * Lots of funny stuff about Canada; Anne Murray, Gordon Lightfoot, CN Tower, having a John Candy a Candadian as an enemy of Canada etc. * Anne Murray's Snowbird, come on, how often you hear that song, lol Things I did not like at times - * I felt the plot could have been slightly more solid at times * Pretty much every character in the movie was an idiot; you felt like you were watched Idiocracy or something ( which IS a good movie) In general, I found the movie laugh out loud funny at times, which is the important part. Sure, it's a satire, and it's an MM satire. While you are supposed to learn something about our country while watching it, I don't think any of MM's views should be a surprise to anyone. So it works better as a comedy where we laugh at the movie, and maybe a bit at ourselves Best scenes - * Hockey arena where Candy badmouths Canada, with no one getting upset - until he says their beer sucks. Now THAT's funny, IMO * Dan Akroyd pulling Candy over, no because the truck is spray but painted with anti-Canadian sentiments, but because it's not bilingual! AND he makes him spray paint the slurs in french - Priceless

    I don't know exactly what to think of Moore's vision of the future. we must remember Michael Moore, the famous director of documentary's like Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine, wrote this story in 1995. though it must have seemed funny way back then, now it looks more like a parody of the way we live right now. but in 1995, people must have laughed with his futuristic vision. yes, it looks a bit like Dr. Strangelove, that's true. but hey, doesn't every Van Damme picture look the same? therefore, Canadian Bacon is very original (because there are not many war comedies of the same caliber as the one of DR. Strangelove). what I particular noticed while watching, was the way Moore used music to lead the audience into the direction he wanted. probably I wasn't the only one who heard the Vietnam war music, but that's not exactly what I meant. the sound that Moore uses to manipulate his audience is superb. for instance, there is the sound of beams of the copy machine when there is trouble in the war room, suggesting the audience that there is something dangerous is about to happen. so that's why I gave this movie 6 points. I could have given it 2 points too, because I liked and I did not like what I saw. see the movie and conclude for yourself.

    An American President (played by Alan Alda) is seeing his popularity ratings plummet and his chances for a second term rapidly disappearing. What to do about it? In this very funny satire, the answer, of course, is to create an enemy to whip up US public opinion in support of the start of a new Cold War. But who will it be against? The Russians are no threat anymore. Well, the obvious choice is - Canada! After all, Canada has massed 90% of its population along the border (they must be up to something!) and the Toronto Blue Jays have won the World Series - twice (and they cheated to do it!) So, "Operation Canadian Bacon" is launched! This is a great satire that pokes fun at pretty much everything and anything: Canada and Canadians, the US and Americans, international relations, arms manufacturers, etc. John Candy was brilliant as Niagara County (NY) sheriff Bud Boomer, who gets so caught up in the anti-Canadians rhetoric being spewed forth from the White House that he takes it upon himself to lead an invasion. Unfortunately, he loses one of his comrades (Honey, played by Rhea Pearlman) who gets arrested in Niagara Falls, Ont. - for littering! To the White House, Honey becomes a hostage. Troops are sent in (and Bud goes too) and the whole thing spirals into a very "serious" international incident, during which Russia almost gets nuked by accident! Candy was the perfect stereotype of the ugly American - loud, crude and totally ignorant of anything outside his own immediate circle (and pretty ignorant within that circle!) Pearlman and Alda were also quite good, and I enjoyed Bill Nunn as Deputy Kabral, another of Boomer's gang, who gripes about being determined to make Canadians "white." There was really no significant Canadian character in the movie, but a brilliant caricature by Dan Aykroyd as an Ontario police officer who pulls Boomer over while he's on his way to rescue Honey in Toronto to insist that the anti-Canadian slogans painted on his truck have to be in French as well to comply with Canadian language laws. I wouldn't say that this was outrageously funny but it was humorous throughout and completely enjoyable. A number of Canadians appear in the cast, and there's some fun poked at the fact that the entertainment industry in the US is so dominated by Canadian actors (surely a plot from up north) and also at some Canadian singers (Ann Murray, Gordon Lightfoot.) There was also a very funny spoof of the tendency of US networks to over-dramatize everything that happens ("Operation Canadian Bacon" with a crossed out maple leaf being the backdrop for an outrageous anchorman, played by Stanley Anderson.) I was surprised to see that this was directed and written by Michael Moore - and in many ways I found this far more entertaining (and effective) than the quasi-documentaries/propaganda pieces he's now more famous for, although it's somewhat low rating makes me wonder if Americans can really understand and/or appreciate both the humour and the caricatures. All in all, I found it to be good fun. 7/10

    This movie was just bloody awful. I don't even know where to begin. I feel like Michael Moore owes me an hour and a half of my life back. Moore needs to stick to doing documentaries because he obviously has no talent directing comedy. Not only was the film not funny, the production value was borderline home movie. While the premise wasn't bad the execution of it was terrible. It is kind of sad when South Park can do a better movie about invading Canada than Michael Moore. He really should be ashamed of himself for claiming to be a film maker after making such a horrible piece of dreck. This film was just a terrible from start to finish.

    There are quite a few satires out there but many have a hard time in keep up with this one. After the Cold War the Americans need a new enemy...Canada! Join John Candy and his group of northern armchair heroes as they take the battle to the Canadians in order to improve the US economy. I should say that this is a fun movie. The satire is top notch as only Micheal Moore can deliver. The interaction between characters is done very well and though a few scenes may be a little harsh politically it is still pretty funny and doesn't lean too much to the left of the political spectrum. I am sad that I didn't get to see this film any sooner. There is a fairly good cast of stars and cameos of several others. It is done well.

    "Canadian Bacon", quite a shocker but not that bad. It's just weird seeing Michael Moore directing a feature film, a politically charged comedy with a stellar cast but distant from what we know he's capable of doing. He's a very opinionated guy, full of energy and with a great sense of humor, so it's frighteningly strange to see this small comedy, almost humorless despite the high caliber comedians starring in it. The premise is similarly absurd as the one from "The Mouse that Roared", but the humor and the criticism isn't repeated in here, it's lost somewhere. With the intention of boosting his popularity sky high after being considered a wimp leader who never declared any war, the U.S. president (Alan Alda) decides to declare war against Canada, believing they have secret weapons. Pressured by a failed businessman (G.D. Spradlin) whose weapons of mass destruction aren't selling anymore and he's needy of a conflict so he can sell it, the president's loyal adviser (Kevin Pollak) instigates him to attack the neighbor nation, encouraging him after a small misunderstand involving a hillbilly American sheriff (John Candy) who offended the Canadians by saying that they beer suck. Confusion formed, war declared and loads of jokes on the expense of both cultures. Canadians are presented as jolly, clean, acceptive of insults (except the one about the beer, which was considered atrocious), while Americans are presented as desperate for combat, with limited intelligence and as Canada haters. Where's the sagacity, the acid satire or the intelligence of this? Where's the masterful Moore in this, the one we get used to see while presenting facts to some, distorting them to others yet giving us a full shocking image of what's wrong with the world? Everything is reduced in being a simple-minded comedy, going for some cheap laughs, only getting some inspired moments when it makes cultural and film references, and some of the performances achieve the desired goal of causing us to laugh a little, and reflect about the part they're playing. Alda was the perfect toyed president, surrounded of intelligent and dangerous people who make things easier for him always telling what he must do. His part is what makes this movie more relevant now than when it was made in 1995. Moore was clearly foreseeing one of his favorite future targets, Bush Jr. The similarity of intent and actions are uncanny. This could be a gold material just like "Wag the Dog" or truthfully hilarious like "Bulworth". Instead it's just another forgettable movie. Among the good parts are the priceless cameo by Dan Aykroyd as an Canadian police officer who teaches sheriff Candy how things work in the country; the president quoting Bob Dylan minutes before almost getting blown up; Bill Nunn exposing why blacks are always put in second place, specially movie characters; the broadcast news anchor (Stanley Anderson) informing about the eminent war; Jim Belushi's cameo as a drunk reporter and Steven Wright's cameo. Kind of awkward when you realize the cameos were more effective than the main cast who besides Candy (sadly his last role and one of the most unfunny he ever made), Alda, Pollak, also have Rip Torn, Rhea Perlman, Kevin J. O'Connor, Wallace Shawn (cameo) and even a brief appearance by Moore himself. It has a fine amount of laughs, tiny ones. It was OK. 6/10

    This movie as absolutely delicious. The humour is so refined and the subtleties hilarious. The fun directed at Canadians is original, based on preconceptions about Canada, on presumptions, and on hearsay. All these elements are put together in a very novel way. One must be a Canadian or else have strong Canadian connections - an excellent understanding of Canada, to fully appreciate this movie. It is an excellent occasion for Canadians to have a good laugh at how they are perceived not only by Americans, but also by a lot of other nations. It appears this movie was never shown in Canadian movie theatres, and that is a real shame, because we missed out on a high quality movie. I am recommending this movie to everyone I know.

The premise is similarly absurd as the one from "The Mouse that Roared", but the humor and the criticism isn't repeated in here, it's lost somewhere. With the intention of boosting his popularity sky high after being considered a wimp leader who never declared any war, the U.S. president (Alan Alda) decides to declare war against Canada, believing they have secret weapons. Pressured by a failed businessman (G.D. Spradlin) whose weapons of mass destruction aren't selling anymore and he's needy of a conflict so he can sell it, the president's loyal adviser (Kevin Pollak) instigates him to attack the neighbor nation, encouraging him after a small misunderstand involving a hillbilly American sheriff (John Candy) who offended the Canadians by saying that they beer suck. Confusion formed, war declared and loads of jokes on the expense of both cultures. Canadians are presented as jolly, clean, acceptive of insults (except the one about the beer, which was considered atrocious), while Americans are presented as desperate for combat, with limited intelligence and as Canada haters. Where's the sagacity, the acid satire or the intelligence of this? Where's the masterful Moore in this, the one we get used to see while presenting facts to some, distorting them to others yet giving us a full shocking image of what's wrong with the world? Everything is reduced in being a simple-minded comedy, going for some cheap laughs, only getting some inspired moments when it makes cultural and film references, and some of the performances achieve the desired goal of causing us to laugh a little, and reflect about the part they're playing. Alda was the perfect toyed president, surrounded of intelligent and dangerous people who make things easier for him always telling what he must do. His part is what makes this movie more relevant now than when it was made in 1995. Moore was clearly foreseeing one of his favorite future targets, Bush Jr. The similarity of intent and actions are uncanny. This could be a gold material just like "Wag the Dog" or truthfully hilarious like "Bulworth". Instead it's just another forgettable movie. Among the good parts are the priceless cameo by Dan Aykroyd as an Canadian police officer who teaches sheriff Candy how things work in the country; the president quoting Bob Dylan minutes before almost getting blown up; Bill Nunn exposing why blacks are always put in second place, specially movie characters; the broadcast news anchor (Stanley Anderson) informing about the eminent war; Jim Belushi's cameo as a drunk reporter and Steven Wright's cameo. Kind of awkward when you realize the cameos were more effective than the main cast who besides Candy (sadly his last role and one of the most unfunny he ever made), Alda, Pollak, also have Rip Torn, Rhea Perlman, Kevin J. O'Connor, Wallace Shawn (cameo) and even a brief appearance by Moore himself. It has a fine amount of laughs, tiny ones. It was OK. 6/10

    This movie as absolutely delicious. The humour is so refined and the subtleties hilarious. The fun directed at Canadians is original, based on preconceptions about Canada, on presumptions, and on hearsay. All these elements are put together in a very novel way. One must be a Canadian or else have strong Canadian connections - an excellent understanding of Canada, to fully appreciate this movie. It is an excellent occasion for Canadians to have a good laugh at how they are perceived not only by Americans, but also by a lot of other nations. It appears this movie was never shown in Canadian movie theatres, and that is a real shame, because we missed out on a high quality movie. I am recommending this movie to everyone I know.

    "Surrender her pronto, or we'll level Toronto." (Reminds me of an old joke: "The Lone Ranger goes to Canada" . . . or . . "On to Toronto,Tonto, pronto!") It's probably easier for a Canadian to like this movie, and to find it funny. Allan Alda's line, above, was one of the many times I laughed out loud -- my real test for a funny movie. What it is, is, an exaggeration of the exaggerated perception that (we think) Americans have about Canada -- the cleanliness, the politeness, the accent ootandabooot etc. Plus, the portrayal of Americans looking like goofs as they stumble around and over-react to those exaggerations. Canadians understand both the substance and the hyperbole around those clich&eacute;s, and the LOLs are easy to come by. Then, of course, the movie exaggerates American clich&eacute;s also, and "everybody" loves to laugh at Americans, even though most Canadians (certaintly the ones that have visited often) have great admiration for the giant to the south, and lots of envy too. Also, lots of movie clich&eacute;s get the same satirical treatment. Hey, it's really great fun at the expense of both sides, although in different ways. I can't believe that it's Roger Moore who put it together -- most of his stuff is so heavy and self-important as to be unwatchable. (On second thought, I guess it IS typical MM -- mocking as much Americana per minute as he can) But he must have been doing different drugs when he did this mini-masterpiece. It cannot go unnoticed, of course, that John Candy, the American sheriff is/was very, very Canadian. Canadians, and Americans who know about Canada, should find this a funny movie worth their time.

    I love this movie. It cracks me up every time I watch it. One of the things I think is funny is the fact that so many Canadians appear in it--although they could be walking undetected among us Americans! The idea of Canadians' massing along the border, preparing to invade the US, is hilariously depicted by the "news media," trying to whip up anti-Canadian feeling. And, Alan Alda as the vacillating politician, with Rip Torn as his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were perfect! I enjoyed hearing the two Mounted Policemen debating about how to end a sentence without using a preposition. Their Canadian accent is more noticeable in that scene than in most others. In real life, it is interesting to consider how-different we are, even though we have so many apparent similarities. Only the Australians or Israelis are more like us Americans than are the Canadians. Yet, we are different. The scary thing is how realistic the idea of creating an enemy, where one doesn't exist may have turned out to be, as in the alleged "weapons of mass destruction" that motivated the invasion of Iraq.

    I don't write a lot of reviews, for the same reason I don't write history books; I'm not creative and verbose enough... So, I'm not sure if I will be able to fulfill the curious minimum word count that IMDb requires from anyone who wants to share a few comments about a film. However, I wish Moore would take his time, develop the ability to focus on one of clever schemes all the way though to the end, because that's all that keeps this movie from becoming a cult classic. It's clever innuendos which take aim at America's propensity to use war and other fabricated emergencies for political benefit is dead on, while also taking potshots at some of the more humorous examples of Canadian culture. Haven't heard such good needling of American policy since Will Rogers; and boy, isn't it timely. Anyway, I suggest only independent thinkers bother to watch Canadian Bacon, because the sheep who believe as they've been told to won't get it. The movie gets a seven rating and so does Michael Moore until he focuses and writes a complete script which it looks like he has the capability of doing.

    Why I liked it - * I feel there's a grain of truth in the political satire * Ties a lot of real stuff into the movie like a city's dependence on a large employer, media manipulation, American ignorance about other countries, American arrogance * Lots of funny stuff about Canada; Anne Murray, Gordon Lightfoot, CN Tower, having a John Candy a Candadian as an enemy of Canada etc. * Anne Murray's Snowbird, come on, how often you hear that song, lol Things I did not like at times - * I felt the plot could have been slightly more solid at times * Pretty much every character in the movie was an idiot; you felt like you were watched Idiocracy or something ( which IS a good movie) In general, I found the movie laugh out loud funny at times, which is the important part. Sure, it's a satire, and it's an MM satire. While you are supposed to learn something about our country while watching it, I don't think any of MM's views should be a surprise to anyone. So it works better as a comedy where we laugh at the movie, and maybe a bit at ourselves Best scenes - * Hockey arena where Candy badmouths Canada, with no one getting upset - until he says their beer sucks. Now THAT's funny, IMO * Dan Akroyd pulling Candy over, no because the truck is spray but painted with anti-Canadian sentiments, but because it's not bilingual! AND he makes him spray paint the slurs in french - Priceless

    I don't know exactly what to think of Moore's vision of the future. we must remember Michael Moore, the famous director of documentary's like Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine, wrote this story in 1995. though it must have seemed funny way back then, now it looks more like a parody of the way we live right now. but in 1995, people must have laughed with his futuristic vision. yes, it looks a bit like Dr. Strangelove, that's true. but hey, doesn't every Van Damme picture look the same? therefore, Canadian Bacon is very original (because there are not many war comedies of the same caliber as the one of DR. Strangelove). what I particular noticed while watching, was the way Moore used music to lead the audience into the direction he wanted. probably I wasn't the only one who heard the Vietnam war music, but that's not exactly what I meant. the sound that Moore uses to manipulate his audience is superb. for instance, there is the sound of beams of the copy machine when there is trouble in the war room, suggesting the audience that there is something dangerous is about to happen. so that's why I gave this movie 6 points. I could have given it 2 points too, because I liked and I did not like what I saw. see the movie and conclude for yourself.

    An American President (played by Alan Alda) is seeing his popularity ratings plummet and his chances for a second term rapidly disappearing. What to do about it? In this very funny satire, the answer, of course, is to create an enemy to whip up US public opinion in support of the start of a new Cold War. But who will it be against? The Russians are no threat anymore. Well, the obvious choice is - Canada! After all, Canada has massed 90% of its population along the border (they must be up to something!) and the Toronto Blue Jays have won the World Series - twice (and they cheated to do it!) So, "Operation Canadian Bacon" is launched! This is a great satire that pokes fun at pretty much everything and anything: Canada and Canadians, the US and Americans, international relations, arms manufacturers, etc. John Candy was brilliant as Niagara County (NY) sheriff Bud Boomer, who gets so caught up in the anti-Canadians rhetoric being spewed forth from the White House that he takes it upon himself to lead an invasion. Unfortunately, he loses one of his comrades (Honey, played by Rhea Pearlman) who gets arrested in Niagara Falls, Ont. - for littering! To the White House, Honey becomes a hostage. Troops are sent in (and Bud goes too) and the whole thing spirals into a very "serious" international incident, during which Russia almost gets nuked by accident! Candy was the perfect stereotype of the ugly American - loud, crude and totally ignorant of anything outside his own immediate circle (and pretty ignorant within that circle!) Pearlman and Alda were also quite good, and I enjoyed Bill Nunn as Deputy Kabral, another of Boomer's gang, who gripes about being determined to make Canadians "white." There was really no significant Canadian character in the movie, but a brilliant caricature by Dan Aykroyd as an Ontario police officer who pulls Boomer over while he's on his way to rescue Honey in Toronto to insist that the anti-Canadian slogans painted on his truck have to be in French as well to comply with Canadian language laws. I wouldn't say that this was outrageously funny but it was humorous throughout and completely enjoyable. A number of Canadians appear in the cast, and there's some fun poked at the fact that the entertainment industry in the US is so dominated by Canadian actors (surely a plot from up north) and also at some Canadian singers (Ann Murray, Gordon Lightfoot.) There was also a very funny spoof of the tendency of US networks to over-dramatize everything that happens ("Operation Canadian Bacon" with a crossed out maple leaf being the backdrop for an outrageous anchorman, played by Stanley Anderson.) I was surprised to see that this was directed and written by Michael Moore - and in many ways I found this far more entertaining (and effective) than the quasi-documentaries/propaganda pieces he's now more famous for, although it's somewhat low rating makes me wonder if Americans can really understand and/or appreciate both the humour and the caricatures. All in all, I found it to be good fun. 7/10

    This movie was just bloody awful. I don't even know where to begin. I feel like Michael Moore owes me an hour and a half of my life back. Moore needs to stick to doing documentaries because he obviously has no talent directing comedy. Not only was the film not funny, the production value was borderline home movie. While the premise wasn't bad the execution of it was terrible. It is kind of sad when South Park can do a better movie about invading Canada than Michael Moore. He really should be ashamed of himself for claiming to be a film maker after making such a horrible piece of dreck. This film was just a terrible from start to finish.

    There are quite a few satires out there but many have a hard time in keep up with this one. After the Cold War the Americans need a new enemy...Canada! Join John Candy and his group of northern armchair heroes as they take the battle to the Canadians in order to improve the US economy. I should say that this is a fun movie. The satire is top notch as only Micheal Moore can deliver. The interaction between characters is done very well and though a few scenes may be a little harsh politically it is still pretty funny and doesn't lean too much to the left of the political spectrum. I am sad that I didn't get to see this film any sooner. There is a fairly good cast of stars and cameos of several others. It is done well.

    "Canadian Bacon", quite a shocker but not that bad. It's just weird seeing Michael Moore directing a feature film, a politically charged comedy with a stellar cast but distant from what we know he's capable of doing. He's a very opinionated guy, full of energy and with a great sense of humor, so it's frighteningly strange to see this small comedy, almost humorless despite the high caliber comedians starring in it. The premise is similarly absurd as the one from "The Mouse that Roared", but the humor and the criticism isn't repeated in here, it's lost somewhere. With the intention of boosting his popularity sky high after being considered a wimp leader who never declared any war, the U.S. president (Alan Alda) decides to declare war against Canada, believing they have secret weapons. Pressured by a failed businessman (G.D. Spradlin) whose weapons of mass destruction aren't selling anymore and he's needy of a conflict so he can sell it, the president's loyal adviser (Kevin Pollak) instigates him to attack the neighbor nation, encouraging him after a small misunderstand involving a hillbilly American sheriff (John Candy) who offended the Canadians by saying that they beer suck. Confusion formed, war declared and loads of jokes on the expense of both cultures. Canadians are presented as jolly, clean, acceptive of insults (except the one about the beer, which was considered atrocious), while Americans are presented as desperate for combat, with limited intelligence and as Canada haters. Where's the sagacity, the acid satire or the intelligence of this? Where's the masterful Moore in this, the one we get used to see while presenting facts to some, distorting them to others yet giving us a full shocking image of what's wrong with the world? Everything is reduced in being a simple-minded comedy, going for some cheap laughs, only getting some inspired moments when it makes cultural and film references, and some of the performances achieve the desired goal of causing us to laugh a little, and reflect about the part they're playing. Alda was the perfect toyed president, surrounded of intelligent and dangerous people who make things easier for him always telling what he must do. His part is what makes this movie more relevant now than when it was made in 1995. Moore was clearly foreseeing one of his favorite future targets, Bush Jr. The similarity of intent and actions are uncanny. This could be a gold material just like "Wag the Dog" or truthfully hilarious like "Bulworth". Instead it's just another forgettable movie. Among the good parts are the priceless cameo by Dan Aykroyd as an Canadian police officer who teaches sheriff Candy how things work in the country; the president quoting Bob Dylan minutes before almost getting blown up; Bill Nunn exposing why blacks are always put in second place, specially movie characters; the broadcast news anchor (Stanley Anderson) informing about the eminent war; Jim Belushi's cameo as a drunk reporter and Steven Wright's cameo.

I wouldn't say that this was outrageously funny but it was humorous throughout and completely enjoyable. A number of Canadians appear in the cast, and there's some fun poked at the fact that the entertainment industry in the US is so dominated by Canadian actors (surely a plot from up north) and also at some Canadian singers (Ann Murray, Gordon Lightfoot.) There was also a very funny spoof of the tendency of US networks to over-dramatize everything that happens ("Operation Canadian Bacon" with a crossed out maple leaf being the backdrop for an outrageous anchorman, played by Stanley Anderson.) I was surprised to see that this was directed and written by Michael Moore - and in many ways I found this far more entertaining (and effective) than the quasi-documentaries/propaganda pieces he's now more famous for, although it's somewhat low rating makes me wonder if Americans can really understand and/or appreciate both the humour and the caricatures. All in all, I found it to be good fun. 7/10

    This movie was just bloody awful. I don't even know where to begin. I feel like Michael Moore owes me an hour and a half of my life back. Moore needs to stick to doing documentaries because he obviously has no talent directing comedy. Not only was the film not funny, the production value was borderline home movie. While the premise wasn't bad the execution of it was terrible. It is kind of sad when South Park can do a better movie about invading Canada than Michael Moore. He really should be ashamed of himself for claiming to be a film maker after making such a horrible piece of dreck. This film was just a terrible from start to finish.

    There are quite a few satires out there but many have a hard time in keep up with this one. After the Cold War the Americans need a new enemy...Canada! Join John Candy and his group of northern armchair heroes as they take the battle to the Canadians in order to improve the US economy. I should say that this is a fun movie. The satire is top notch as only Micheal Moore can deliver. The interaction between characters is done very well and though a few scenes may be a little harsh politically it is still pretty funny and doesn't lean too much to the left of the political spectrum. I am sad that I didn't get to see this film any sooner. There is a fairly good cast of stars and cameos of several others. It is done well.

    "Canadian Bacon", quite a shocker but not that bad. It's just weird seeing Michael Moore directing a feature film, a politically charged comedy with a stellar cast but distant from what we know he's capable of doing. He's a very opinionated guy, full of energy and with a great sense of humor, so it's frighteningly strange to see this small comedy, almost humorless despite the high caliber comedians starring in it. The premise is similarly absurd as the one from "The Mouse that Roared", but the humor and the criticism isn't repeated in here, it's lost somewhere. With the intention of boosting his popularity sky high after being considered a wimp leader who never declared any war, the U.S. president (Alan Alda) decides to declare war against Canada, believing they have secret weapons. Pressured by a failed businessman (G.D. Spradlin) whose weapons of mass destruction aren't selling anymore and he's needy of a conflict so he can sell it, the president's loyal adviser (Kevin Pollak) instigates him to attack the neighbor nation, encouraging him after a small misunderstand involving a hillbilly American sheriff (John Candy) who offended the Canadians by saying that they beer suck. Confusion formed, war declared and loads of jokes on the expense of both cultures. Canadians are presented as jolly, clean, acceptive of insults (except the one about the beer, which was considered atrocious), while Americans are presented as desperate for combat, with limited intelligence and as Canada haters. Where's the sagacity, the acid satire or the intelligence of this? Where's the masterful Moore in this, the one we get used to see while presenting facts to some, distorting them to others yet giving us a full shocking image of what's wrong with the world? Everything is reduced in being a simple-minded comedy, going for some cheap laughs, only getting some inspired moments when it makes cultural and film references, and some of the performances achieve the desired goal of causing us to laugh a little, and reflect about the part they're playing. Alda was the perfect toyed president, surrounded of intelligent and dangerous people who make things easier for him always telling what he must do. His part is what makes this movie more relevant now than when it was made in 1995. Moore was clearly foreseeing one of his favorite future targets, Bush Jr. The similarity of intent and actions are uncanny. This could be a gold material just like "Wag the Dog" or truthfully hilarious like "Bulworth". Instead it's just another forgettable movie. Among the good parts are the priceless cameo by Dan Aykroyd as an Canadian police officer who teaches sheriff Candy how things work in the country; the president quoting Bob Dylan minutes before almost getting blown up; Bill Nunn exposing why blacks are always put in second place, specially movie characters; the broadcast news anchor (Stanley Anderson) informing about the eminent war; Jim Belushi's cameo as a drunk reporter and Steven Wright's cameo. Kind of awkward when you realize the cameos were more effective than the main cast who besides Candy (sadly his last role and one of the most unfunny he ever made), Alda, Pollak, also have Rip Torn, Rhea Perlman, Kevin J. O'Connor, Wallace Shawn (cameo) and even a brief appearance by Moore himself. It has a fine amount of laughs, tiny ones. It was OK. 6/10

    This movie as absolutely delicious. The humour is so refined and the subtleties hilarious. The fun directed at Canadians is original, based on preconceptions about Canada, on presumptions, and on hearsay. All these elements are put together in a very novel way. One must be a Canadian or else have strong Canadian connections - an excellent understanding of Canada, to fully appreciate this movie. It is an excellent occasion for Canadians to have a good laugh at how they are perceived not only by Americans, but also by a lot of other nations. It appears this movie was never shown in Canadian movie theatres, and that is a real shame, because we missed out on a high quality movie. I am recommending this movie to everyone I know.

    "Surrender her pronto, or we'll level Toronto." (Reminds me of an old joke: "The Lone Ranger goes to Canada" . . . or . . "On to Toronto,Tonto, pronto!") It's probably easier for a Canadian to like this movie, and to find it funny. Allan Alda's line, above, was one of the many times I laughed out loud -- my real test for a funny movie. What it is, is, an exaggeration of the exaggerated perception that (we think) Americans have about Canada -- the cleanliness, the politeness, the accent ootandabooot etc. Plus, the portrayal of Americans looking like goofs as they stumble around and over-react to those exaggerations. Canadians understand both the substance and the hyperbole around those clich&eacute;s, and the LOLs are easy to come by. Then, of course, the movie exaggerates American clich&eacute;s also, and "everybody" loves to laugh at Americans, even though most Canadians (certaintly the ones that have visited often) have great admiration for the giant to the south, and lots of envy too. Also, lots of movie clich&eacute;s get the same satirical treatment. Hey, it's really great fun at the expense of both sides, although in different ways. I can't believe that it's Roger Moore who put it together -- most of his stuff is so heavy and self-important as to be unwatchable. (On second thought, I guess it IS typical MM -- mocking as much Americana per minute as he can) But he must have been doing different drugs when he did this mini-masterpiece. It cannot go unnoticed, of course, that John Candy, the American sheriff is/was very, very Canadian. Canadians, and Americans who know about Canada, should find this a funny movie worth their time.

    I love this movie. It cracks me up every time I watch it. One of the things I think is funny is the fact that so many Canadians appear in it--although they could be walking undetected among us Americans! The idea of Canadians' massing along the border, preparing to invade the US, is hilariously depicted by the "news media," trying to whip up anti-Canadian feeling. And, Alan Alda as the vacillating politician, with Rip Torn as his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were perfect! I enjoyed hearing the two Mounted Policemen debating about how to end a sentence without using a preposition. Their Canadian accent is more noticeable in that scene than in most others. In real life, it is interesting to consider how-different we are, even though we have so many apparent similarities. Only the Australians or Israelis are more like us Americans than are the Canadians. Yet, we are different. The scary thing is how realistic the idea of creating an enemy, where one doesn't exist may have turned out to be, as in the alleged "weapons of mass destruction" that motivated the invasion of Iraq.

    I don't write a lot of reviews, for the same reason I don't write history books; I'm not creative and verbose enough... So, I'm not sure if I will be able to fulfill the curious minimum word count that IMDb requires from anyone who wants to share a few comments about a film. However, I wish Moore would take his time, develop the ability to focus on one of clever schemes all the way though to the end, because that's all that keeps this movie from becoming a cult classic. It's clever innuendos which take aim at America's propensity to use war and other fabricated emergencies for political benefit is dead on, while also taking potshots at some of the more humorous examples of Canadian culture. Haven't heard such good needling of American policy since Will Rogers; and boy, isn't it timely. Anyway, I suggest only independent thinkers bother to watch Canadian Bacon, because the sheep who believe as they've been told to won't get it. The movie gets a seven rating and so does Michael Moore until he focuses and writes a complete script which it looks like he has the capability of doing.

    Why I liked it - * I feel there's a grain of truth in the political satire * Ties a lot of real stuff into the movie like a city's dependence on a large employer, media manipulation, American ignorance about other countries, American arrogance * Lots of funny stuff about Canada; Anne Murray, Gordon Lightfoot, CN Tower, having a John Candy a Candadian as an enemy of Canada etc. * Anne Murray's Snowbird, come on, how often you hear that song, lol Things I did not like at times - * I felt the plot could have been slightly more solid at times * Pretty much every character in the movie was an idiot; you felt like you were watched Idiocracy or something ( which IS a good movie) In general, I found the movie laugh out loud funny at times, which is the important part. Sure, it's a satire, and it's an MM satire. While you are supposed to learn something about our country while watching it, I don't think any of MM's views should be a surprise to anyone. So it works better as a comedy where we laugh at the movie, and maybe a bit at ourselves Best scenes - * Hockey arena where Candy badmouths Canada, with no one getting upset - until he says their beer sucks. Now THAT's funny, IMO * Dan Akroyd pulling Candy over, no because the truck is spray but painted with anti-Canadian sentiments, but because it's not bilingual! AND he makes him spray paint the slurs in french - Priceless

    I don't know exactly what to think of Moore's vision of the future. we must remember Michael Moore, the famous director of documentary's like Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine, wrote this story in 1995. though it must have seemed funny way back then, now it looks more like a parody of the way we live right now. but in 1995, people must have laughed with his futuristic vision. yes, it looks a bit like Dr. Strangelove, that's true. but hey, doesn't every Van Damme picture look the same? therefore, Canadian Bacon is very original (because there are not many war comedies of the same caliber as the one of DR. Strangelove). what I particular noticed while watching, was the way Moore used music to lead the audience into the direction he wanted. probably I wasn't the only one who heard the Vietnam war music, but that's not exactly what I meant. the sound that Moore uses to manipulate his audience is superb. for instance, there is the sound of beams of the copy machine when there is trouble in the war room, suggesting the audience that there is something dangerous is about to happen. so that's why I gave this movie 6 points. I could have given it 2 points too, because I liked and I did not like what I saw. see the movie and conclude for yourself.

    An American President (played by Alan Alda) is seeing his popularity ratings plummet and his chances for a second term rapidly disappearing. What to do about it? In this very funny satire, the answer, of course, is to create an enemy to whip up US public opinion in support of the start of a new Cold War. But who will it be against? The Russians are no threat anymore. Well, the obvious choice is - Canada! After all, Canada has massed 90% of its population along the border (they must be up to something!) and the Toronto Blue Jays have won the World Series - twice (and they cheated to do it!) So, "Operation Canadian Bacon" is launched! This is a great satire that pokes fun at pretty much everything and anything: Canada and Canadians, the US and Americans, international relations, arms manufacturers, etc. John Candy was brilliant as Niagara County (NY) sheriff Bud Boomer, who gets so caught up in the anti-Canadians rhetoric being spewed forth from the White House that he takes it upon himself to lead an invasion. Unfortunately, he loses one of his comrades (Honey, played by Rhea Pearlman) who gets arrested in Niagara Falls, Ont. - for littering! To the White House, Honey becomes a hostage. Troops are sent in (and Bud goes too) and the whole thing spirals into a very "serious" international incident, during which Russia almost gets nuked by accident! Candy was the perfect stereotype of the ugly American - loud, crude and totally ignorant of anything outside his own immediate circle (and pretty ignorant within that circle!) Pearlman and Alda were also quite good, and I enjoyed Bill Nunn as Deputy Kabral, another of Boomer's gang, who gripes about being determined to make Canadians "white." There was really no significant Canadian character in the movie, but a brilliant caricature by Dan Aykroyd as an Ontario police officer who pulls Boomer over while he's on his way to rescue Honey in Toronto to insist that the anti-Canadian slogans painted on his truck have to be in French as well to comply with Canadian language laws. I wouldn't say that this was outrageously funny but it was humorous throughout and completely enjoyable. A number of Canadians appear in the cast, and there's some fun poked at the fact that the entertainment industry in the US is so dominated by Canadian actors (surely a plot from up north) and also at some Canadian singers (Ann Murray, Gordon Lightfoot.) There was also a very funny spoof of the tendency of US networks to over-dramatize everything that happens ("Operation Canadian Bacon" with a crossed out maple leaf being the backdrop for an outrageous anchorman, played by Stanley Anderson.) I was surprised to see that this was directed and written by Michael Moore - and in many ways I found this far more entertaining (and effective) than the quasi-documentaries/propaganda pieces he's now more famous for, although it's somewhat low rating makes me wonder if Americans can really understand and/or appreciate both the humour and the caricatures. All in all, I found it to be good fun. 7/10
