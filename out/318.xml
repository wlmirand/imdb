    One of the best movies i have ever seen. Its depiction of the German war was absolutely brilliant, very detailed and well directed. A powerful and inspirational movie that shows the struggles of the Jews and the Atrocity of the Germans. Followed up by brilliant performances from Liam Neeson, Depicting the role of Oscar Schindler brilliantly, his acting was flawless and without a doubt the best i have seen. Also as brilliant as ever Ben Kingsley played Itzhak Stern and completely mastered the character. Ralph Fiennes also brilliantly characterized the role of Amon Goeth and nailed it. Overall the movie was a excellent example a masterpiece and to have a Director like Steven Spielberg, with his enormous experience and brilliant directing took the movie to the next level.

    During World War 2nd, Nazi was persecuting Hebrew. In such a situation, there was a man. Though he was German, he sheltered a lot of Hebrew by employing them as workers of his factory. He is Oskar Schindler. This film shows the story about him and what we must not forget forever. I have watched this film three times. When I did for the first time, I was an elementary school student. So then I couldn't understand anything about the film. But now I can and think it is worth watching so much, because it teaches us a lot of things that we should know. What Nazi did, of course, is very cruel and must not be repeated. We has to remember not only this but also people who did something merciful to help someone on the edge of death. They stand for justice, I think. The film has a lot of terrible scenes, so it is hard to see them. But they represent what happened in the real. Therefore I tried not to miss the portraits and remember them. Oskar Schindler is one of the people I really respect. If you don't know him, please watch this film.

    This is an amazing movie! It shows the hardship of the Jewish people during the holocaust. The movie shows the real brutality of the Nazi leaders and soldiers. Being in black and white it adds emotion to the movie. No one better than Liam Neeson could have acted the part of Oskar Schindler! Schindler's list is such a good movie I could easily watch it over and over. The only downside is it would have been interesting to see the movie in color but I do understand the reason why the movie is what it is. If you have not watched this movie and you are reading this review, you must watch it right away! This is also a good movie that would be good to show to teenagers in high school, to educate them about the holocaust.

    The film Schindler's List is a powerfully film, its one that give back so much more than just a film would. The actor Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler gives a performance of his life. Playing the role, as Oskar Schindler can be not small task, this film plays a big part in telling his story behind the man that saved so many lives. World War II was a very important part of history it took a brave to save all those people with the help of Itzhak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Schindler had made it so the Jews were put on a train and taken to his factory to work in order to save their lives. Schindler's List is set in the time of Would War II at the time when German Nazis soldiers under the command of Hitler. Oskar Schindler was a pretentious and materialistic German businessman who had becomes an unbelievable humanitarian amongst the brutal Nazi reign. When he feels compelled to turn his factory into a save haven for Jews. This is where he saved about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp or being gunned down. The film is done were tastefully in the black and white style except for one little girl that you see twice in this film. She is wearing a red coat the first time she is running down the road and then the second time in a wheelbarrow. This make a very large impact to the film in the way the meaning behind it being that she is alive in one scene and the next dead because she is a Jew. At this point Schindler knows that he most do something and something big. He had started off small and then wanted more. He felt that he never did enough he felt that he could have saved more. This film is done as tastefully as can be with the film showing what would happen to Jews in the time of World War II. With girls be raped and forced to do things that is wrong on so many different levels. Children being ripped away from there parents and forced in to slave labor, whose who were not able to work killed. Then so much more if the Jews would hide or try to run away being killed on the spot. That this time so many people wanted to do something but would not in fear of being killed, Schindler was the man who saved the most and wanted to help in the vastest way. This is a must see film and should be shown in school while teaching about World War II.

    Steven Spielberg won a well-deserved Academy Award(as did the film itself) for directing this emotionally shattering, dramatically devastating film about opportunistic businessman Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson in a superb performance) who goes into business with the Nazis, and Amon Goeth(Ralph Fiennes, unforgettable performance) the death camp commandant who supplies him with imprisoned Jews for his factories. Ben Kingsly plays Itzhak Stern, his secretary who helps Schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the Nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives. Masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the Jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite John Williams score), and Amon Goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid. The ending to the film when Schindler breaks down, and the Jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the Coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever. A stunning achievement for all concerned, especially Mr. Spielberg.

    Schindler's List is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline that takes its time telling a very long story but never fails to be interesting.The films cast is pitch perfect,its without a doubt one of Liam Neeson's most impressive performances,but I think the best performance has to go to Ralph Fiennes,his performance as Amon Goeth was unbelievably inspired and he put a lot of heart in to it.Obviously a lot of credit for making this film so beautiful is Steven Spielberg,easily one of the best directors of all time,he clearly has a huge interest in World War 2 and puts so much heart and effort into every film he makes.If your a fan of war and biography films and just a moviegoer in general,Schindler's List should not be missed. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson),a man sent out to exploit Jewish labor,finds himself unexpectedly risking everything to save lives.

    This film is an extraordinary tale of 1 man saving 1200 lives of persecuted Jews during the Holocaust. Oskar Schindler is shown initially as an opportunist industrialist who is out to make the most of the war.But as the war continues and as he witnesses the atrocities, he focuses of saving as many Jews as he can. The film has one of the most gripping and heart-touching portrayals of the Holocaust. The Nazi soldier Goeth is another character the viewer would find intriguing. The Jewish saying "Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire",is a pivotal element of the plot. The value of Human life is unequaled. The direction by Steven Spielberg,in combination with spectacular performances from Liam Neeson,Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes makes this movie an Epic to cherish.The B&W touch in the cinematography transcends the viewing experience to another plane.The score,which materializes the horrors and tragedy of the Holocaust,by John Williams deserves special mention.

    Seriously talking, when I first tried to watch this movie I was surprised by the length (Over 3 hours) and that too in Black and White motion picture. I thought of leaving this movie. Then I thought of giving it a try taking into account that this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, a legend. I gave this movie two-three tries to watch but after watching 10 minutes I was taken aback every time due to its length. Finally, I thought of giving it a final try. That day me and my very good friend both started watching the movie at their own houses. After watching the initial 15 minutes, I was so engrossed in the movie I forgot everything that whether its in Black and White or its length. The complete 3 hours+ was a roller-coaster ride where I was spell bounded by the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and not to forget Ralph Fiennes. I was completely lost for the next few days only thinking about this movie, the direction of the Genius, Spielberg, the writers, etc. After watching the movie that night, Me and my friend talked over the phone and we both were speechless, watching this masterclass. A movie over Jews and Nazis during world war II, cannot be portrayed in a more beautiful way than this one. Some scenes will leave you stunned and might even cause you to lose faith over mankind. I will recommend this masterpiece to every movie lover who sees movie from their heart and loves watching masterpiece like these. This will for sure remain the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I love to watch it again and again. A full 10/10 for this one, as I don't see any flaw in this movie and Hats-Off for the legend STEVEN SPIELBERG!!! #Respect

    I cried throughout this entire film the first time I watched it. It was so moving and powerful. The ash from burning bodies raining down from the sky, and the little children hiding in the cesspit, and the men and women running around naked during the medial inspection in the courtyard. I just sat there and cried. And after the movie was finished I ran out and bought it on DVD but have not been able to watch it again. I just can't bring myself to watch it. I have had it for 6 years now still in the wrapper. This is how much the movie moved me. I am still in my 20's and like many have only read about the holocaust and it's hard to imagine what the Jews might have gone through, well this movie will paint a very clear picture for anyone who watches it. Spielberg is a genius on so many levels and he has been for some time now. I hope he continues to educate us with his many works of art.

    Everything about this film is amazing. From the acting to the cinematography... all of it is visually pleasing. More importantly the story itself is moving, and disturbing. while watching Schlinder's List, I found myself continuously (and unsuccessfully I might add) fighting back tears. I think this is a film that should be shown in film schools to illustrate how to make a great film. I applaud the Director Steven Spielberg for his incredible vision and brilliant story telling. The performance of each of actor the made me believe and feel their individual truths. Special credit goes to Liam Neeson for the transformation in his performance. The man is amazing!

    During World War 2nd, Nazi was persecuting Hebrew. In such a situation, there was a man. Though he was German, he sheltered a lot of Hebrew by employing them as workers of his factory. He is Oskar Schindler. This film shows the story about him and what we must not forget forever. I have watched this film three times. When I did for the first time, I was an elementary school student. So then I couldn't understand anything about the film. But now I can and think it is worth watching so much, because it teaches us a lot of things that we should know. What Nazi did, of course, is very cruel and must not be repeated. We has to remember not only this but also people who did something merciful to help someone on the edge of death. They stand for justice, I think. The film has a lot of terrible scenes, so it is hard to see them. But they represent what happened in the real. Therefore I tried not to miss the portraits and remember them. Oskar Schindler is one of the people I really respect. If you don't know him, please watch this film.

    This is an amazing movie! It shows the hardship of the Jewish people during the holocaust. The movie shows the real brutality of the Nazi leaders and soldiers. Being in black and white it adds emotion to the movie. No one better than Liam Neeson could have acted the part of Oskar Schindler! Schindler's list is such a good movie I could easily watch it over and over. The only downside is it would have been interesting to see the movie in color but I do understand the reason why the movie is what it is. If you have not watched this movie and you are reading this review, you must watch it right away! This is also a good movie that would be good to show to teenagers in high school, to educate them about the holocaust.

    The film Schindler's List is a powerfully film, its one that give back so much more than just a film would. The actor Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler gives a performance of his life. Playing the role, as Oskar Schindler can be not small task, this film plays a big part in telling his story behind the man that saved so many lives. World War II was a very important part of history it took a brave to save all those people with the help of Itzhak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Schindler had made it so the Jews were put on a train and taken to his factory to work in order to save their lives. Schindler's List is set in the time of Would War II at the time when German Nazis soldiers under the command of Hitler. Oskar Schindler was a pretentious and materialistic German businessman who had becomes an unbelievable humanitarian amongst the brutal Nazi reign. When he feels compelled to turn his factory into a save haven for Jews. This is where he saved about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp or being gunned down. The film is done were tastefully in the black and white style except for one little girl that you see twice in this film. She is wearing a red coat the first time she is running down the road and then the second time in a wheelbarrow. This make a very large impact to the film in the way the meaning behind it being that she is alive in one scene and the next dead because she is a Jew. At this point Schindler knows that he most do something and something big. He had started off small and then wanted more. He felt that he never did enough he felt that he could have saved more. This film is done as tastefully as can be with the film showing what would happen to Jews in the time of World War II. With girls be raped and forced to do things that is wrong on so many different levels. Children being ripped away from there parents and forced in to slave labor, whose who were not able to work killed. Then so much more if the Jews would hide or try to run away being killed on the spot. That this time so many people wanted to do something but would not in fear of being killed, Schindler was the man who saved the most and wanted to help in the vastest way. This is a must see film and should be shown in school while teaching about World War II.

    Steven Spielberg won a well-deserved Academy Award(as did the film itself) for directing this emotionally shattering, dramatically devastating film about opportunistic businessman Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson in a superb performance) who goes into business with the Nazis, and Amon Goeth(Ralph Fiennes, unforgettable performance) the death camp commandant who supplies him with imprisoned Jews for his factories. Ben Kingsly plays Itzhak Stern, his secretary who helps Schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the Nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives. Masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the Jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite John Williams score), and Amon Goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid. The ending to the film when Schindler breaks down, and the Jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the Coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever. A stunning achievement for all concerned, especially Mr. Spielberg.

    Schindler's List is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline that takes its time telling a very long story but never fails to be interesting.The films cast is pitch perfect,its without a doubt one of Liam Neeson's most impressive performances,but I think the best performance has to go to Ralph Fiennes,his performance as Amon Goeth was unbelievably inspired and he put a lot of heart in to it.Obviously a lot of credit for making this film so beautiful is Steven Spielberg,easily one of the best directors of all time,he clearly has a huge interest in World War 2 and puts so much heart and effort into every film he makes.If your a fan of war and biography films and just a moviegoer in general,Schindler's List should not be missed. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson),a man sent out to exploit Jewish labor,finds himself unexpectedly risking everything to save lives.

    This film is an extraordinary tale of 1 man saving 1200 lives of persecuted Jews during the Holocaust. Oskar Schindler is shown initially as an opportunist industrialist who is out to make the most of the war.But as the war continues and as he witnesses the atrocities, he focuses of saving as many Jews as he can. The film has one of the most gripping and heart-touching portrayals of the Holocaust. The Nazi soldier Goeth is another character the viewer would find intriguing. The Jewish saying "Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire",is a pivotal element of the plot. The value of Human life is unequaled. The direction by Steven Spielberg,in combination with spectacular performances from Liam Neeson,Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes makes this movie an Epic to cherish.The B&W touch in the cinematography transcends the viewing experience to another plane.The score,which materializes the horrors and tragedy of the Holocaust,by John Williams deserves special mention.

    Seriously talking, when I first tried to watch this movie I was surprised by the length (Over 3 hours) and that too in Black and White motion picture. I thought of leaving this movie. Then I thought of giving it a try taking into account that this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, a legend. I gave this movie two-three tries to watch but after watching 10 minutes I was taken aback every time due to its length. Finally, I thought of giving it a final try. That day me and my very good friend both started watching the movie at their own houses. After watching the initial 15 minutes, I was so engrossed in the movie I forgot everything that whether its in Black and White or its length. The complete 3 hours+ was a roller-coaster ride where I was spell bounded by the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and not to forget Ralph Fiennes. I was completely lost for the next few days only thinking about this movie, the direction of the Genius, Spielberg, the writers, etc. After watching the movie that night, Me and my friend talked over the phone and we both were speechless, watching this masterclass. A movie over Jews and Nazis during world war II, cannot be portrayed in a more beautiful way than this one. Some scenes will leave you stunned and might even cause you to lose faith over mankind. I will recommend this masterpiece to every movie lover who sees movie from their heart and loves watching masterpiece like these. This will for sure remain the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I love to watch it again and again. A full 10/10 for this one, as I don't see any flaw in this movie and Hats-Off for the legend STEVEN SPIELBERG!!! #Respect

    I cried throughout this entire film the first time I watched it. It was so moving and powerful. The ash from burning bodies raining down from the sky, and the little children hiding in the cesspit, and the men and women running around naked during the medial inspection in the courtyard. I just sat there and cried. And after the movie was finished I ran out and bought it on DVD but have not been able to watch it again. I just can't bring myself to watch it. I have had it for 6 years now still in the wrapper. This is how much the movie moved me. I am still in my 20's and like many have only read about the holocaust and it's hard to imagine what the Jews might have gone through, well this movie will paint a very clear picture for anyone who watches it. Spielberg is a genius on so many levels and he has been for some time now. I hope he continues to educate us with his many works of art.

    Everything about this film is amazing. From the acting to the cinematography... all of it is visually pleasing. More importantly the story itself is moving, and disturbing. while watching Schlinder's List, I found myself continuously (and unsuccessfully I might add) fighting back tears. I think this is a film that should be shown in film schools to illustrate how to make a great film. I applaud the Director Steven Spielberg for his incredible vision and brilliant story telling. The performance of each of actor the made me believe and feel their individual truths. Special credit goes to Liam Neeson for the transformation in his performance. The man is amazing!

    One of the best movies i have ever seen. Its depiction of the German war was absolutely brilliant, very detailed and well directed. A powerful and inspirational movie that shows the struggles of the Jews and the Atrocity of the Germans. Followed up by brilliant performances from Liam Neeson, Depicting the role of Oscar Schindler brilliantly, his acting was flawless and without a doubt the best i have seen. Also as brilliant as ever Ben Kingsley played Itzhak Stern and completely mastered the character. Ralph Fiennes also brilliantly characterized the role of Amon Goeth and nailed it. Overall the movie was a excellent example a masterpiece and to have a Director like Steven Spielberg, with his enormous experience and brilliant directing took the movie to the next level.

    During World War 2nd, Nazi was persecuting Hebrew. In such a situation, there was a man. Though he was German, he sheltered a lot of Hebrew by employing them as workers of his factory. He is Oskar Schindler. This film shows the story about him and what we must not forget forever. I have watched this film three times. When I did for the first time, I was an elementary school student. So then I couldn't understand anything about the film. But now I can and think it is worth watching so much, because it teaches us a lot of things that we should know. What Nazi did, of course, is very cruel and must not be repeated.

    The film Schindler's List is a powerfully film, its one that give back so much more than just a film would. The actor Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler gives a performance of his life. Playing the role, as Oskar Schindler can be not small task, this film plays a big part in telling his story behind the man that saved so many lives. World War II was a very important part of history it took a brave to save all those people with the help of Itzhak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Schindler had made it so the Jews were put on a train and taken to his factory to work in order to save their lives. Schindler's List is set in the time of Would War II at the time when German Nazis soldiers under the command of Hitler. Oskar Schindler was a pretentious and materialistic German businessman who had becomes an unbelievable humanitarian amongst the brutal Nazi reign. When he feels compelled to turn his factory into a save haven for Jews. This is where he saved about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp or being gunned down. The film is done were tastefully in the black and white style except for one little girl that you see twice in this film. She is wearing a red coat the first time she is running down the road and then the second time in a wheelbarrow. This make a very large impact to the film in the way the meaning behind it being that she is alive in one scene and the next dead because she is a Jew. At this point Schindler knows that he most do something and something big. He had started off small and then wanted more. He felt that he never did enough he felt that he could have saved more. This film is done as tastefully as can be with the film showing what would happen to Jews in the time of World War II. With girls be raped and forced to do things that is wrong on so many different levels. Children being ripped away from there parents and forced in to slave labor, whose who were not able to work killed. Then so much more if the Jews would hide or try to run away being killed on the spot. That this time so many people wanted to do something but would not in fear of being killed, Schindler was the man who saved the most and wanted to help in the vastest way. This is a must see film and should be shown in school while teaching about World War II.

    Steven Spielberg won a well-deserved Academy Award(as did the film itself) for directing this emotionally shattering, dramatically devastating film about opportunistic businessman Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson in a superb performance) who goes into business with the Nazis, and Amon Goeth(Ralph Fiennes, unforgettable performance) the death camp commandant who supplies him with imprisoned Jews for his factories. Ben Kingsly plays Itzhak Stern, his secretary who helps Schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the Nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives. Masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the Jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite John Williams score), and Amon Goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid. The ending to the film when Schindler breaks down, and the Jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the Coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever. A stunning achievement for all concerned, especially Mr. Spielberg.

    Schindler's List is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline that takes its time telling a very long story but never fails to be interesting.The films cast is pitch perfect,its without a doubt one of Liam Neeson's most impressive performances,but I think the best performance has to go to Ralph Fiennes,his performance as Amon Goeth was unbelievably inspired and he put a lot of heart in to it.Obviously a lot of credit for making this film so beautiful is Steven Spielberg,easily one of the best directors of all time,he clearly has a huge interest in World War 2 and puts so much heart and effort into every film he makes.If your a fan of war and biography films and just a moviegoer in general,Schindler's List should not be missed. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson),a man sent out to exploit Jewish labor,finds himself unexpectedly risking everything to save lives.

    This film is an extraordinary tale of 1 man saving 1200 lives of persecuted Jews during the Holocaust. Oskar Schindler is shown initially as an opportunist industrialist who is out to make the most of the war.But as the war continues and as he witnesses the atrocities, he focuses of saving as many Jews as he can. The film has one of the most gripping and heart-touching portrayals of the Holocaust. The Nazi soldier Goeth is another character the viewer would find intriguing. The Jewish saying "Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire",is a pivotal element of the plot. The value of Human life is unequaled. The direction by Steven Spielberg,in combination with spectacular performances from Liam Neeson,Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes makes this movie an Epic to cherish.The B&W touch in the cinematography transcends the viewing experience to another plane.The score,which materializes the horrors and tragedy of the Holocaust,by John Williams deserves special mention.

    Seriously talking, when I first tried to watch this movie I was surprised by the length (Over 3 hours) and that too in Black and White motion picture. I thought of leaving this movie. Then I thought of giving it a try taking into account that this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, a legend. I gave this movie two-three tries to watch but after watching 10 minutes I was taken aback every time due to its length. Finally, I thought of giving it a final try. That day me and my very good friend both started watching the movie at their own houses. After watching the initial 15 minutes, I was so engrossed in the movie I forgot everything that whether its in Black and White or its length. The complete 3 hours+ was a roller-coaster ride where I was spell bounded by the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and not to forget Ralph Fiennes. I was completely lost for the next few days only thinking about this movie, the direction of the Genius, Spielberg, the writers, etc. After watching the movie that night, Me and my friend talked over the phone and we both were speechless, watching this masterclass. A movie over Jews and Nazis during world war II, cannot be portrayed in a more beautiful way than this one. Some scenes will leave you stunned and might even cause you to lose faith over mankind. I will recommend this masterpiece to every movie lover who sees movie from their heart and loves watching masterpiece like these. This will for sure remain the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I love to watch it again and again. A full 10/10 for this one, as I don't see any flaw in this movie and Hats-Off for the legend STEVEN SPIELBERG!!! #Respect

    I cried throughout this entire film the first time I watched it. It was so moving and powerful. The ash from burning bodies raining down from the sky, and the little children hiding in the cesspit, and the men and women running around naked during the medial inspection in the courtyard. I just sat there and cried. And after the movie was finished I ran out and bought it on DVD but have not been able to watch it again. I just can't bring myself to watch it. I have had it for 6 years now still in the wrapper. This is how much the movie moved me. I am still in my 20's and like many have only read about the holocaust and it's hard to imagine what the Jews might have gone through, well this movie will paint a very clear picture for anyone who watches it. Spielberg is a genius on so many levels and he has been for some time now. I hope he continues to educate us with his many works of art.

    Everything about this film is amazing. From the acting to the cinematography... all of it is visually pleasing. More importantly the story itself is moving, and disturbing. while watching Schlinder's List, I found myself continuously (and unsuccessfully I might add) fighting back tears. I think this is a film that should be shown in film schools to illustrate how to make a great film. I applaud the Director Steven Spielberg for his incredible vision and brilliant story telling. The performance of each of actor the made me believe and feel their individual truths. Special credit goes to Liam Neeson for the transformation in his performance. The man is amazing!

    One of the best movies i have ever seen. Its depiction of the German war was absolutely brilliant, very detailed and well directed. A powerful and inspirational movie that shows the struggles of the Jews and the Atrocity of the Germans. Followed up by brilliant performances from Liam Neeson, Depicting the role of Oscar Schindler brilliantly, his acting was flawless and without a doubt the best i have seen. Also as brilliant as ever Ben Kingsley played Itzhak Stern and completely mastered the character. Ralph Fiennes also brilliantly characterized the role of Amon Goeth and nailed it. Overall the movie was a excellent example a masterpiece and to have a Director like Steven Spielberg, with his enormous experience and brilliant directing took the movie to the next level.

    During World War 2nd, Nazi was persecuting Hebrew. In such a situation, there was a man. Though he was German, he sheltered a lot of Hebrew by employing them as workers of his factory. He is Oskar Schindler. This film shows the story about him and what we must not forget forever. I have watched this film three times. When I did for the first time, I was an elementary school student. So then I couldn't understand anything about the film. But now I can and think it is worth watching so much, because it teaches us a lot of things that we should know. What Nazi did, of course, is very cruel and must not be repeated. We has to remember not only this but also people who did something merciful to help someone on the edge of death. They stand for justice, I think. The film has a lot of terrible scenes, so it is hard to see them. But they represent what happened in the real. Therefore I tried not to miss the portraits and remember them. Oskar Schindler is one of the people I really respect. If you don't know him, please watch this film.

    This is an amazing movie! It shows the hardship of the Jewish people during the holocaust. The movie shows the real brutality of the Nazi leaders and soldiers. Being in black and white it adds emotion to the movie. No one better than Liam Neeson could have acted the part of Oskar Schindler! Schindler's list is such a good movie I could easily watch it over and over. The only downside is it would have been interesting to see the movie in color but I do understand the reason why the movie is what it is. If you have not watched this movie and you are reading this review, you must watch it right away! This is also a good movie that would be good to show to teenagers in high school, to educate them about the holocaust.

    The film Schindler's List is a powerfully film, its one that give back so much more than just a film would. The actor Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler gives a performance of his life. Playing the role, as Oskar Schindler can be not small task, this film plays a big part in telling his story behind the man that saved so many lives. World War II was a very important part of history it took a brave to save all those people with the help of Itzhak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Schindler had made it so the Jews were put on a train and taken to his factory to work in order to save their lives. Schindler's List is set in the time of Would War II at the time when German Nazis soldiers under the command of Hitler. Oskar Schindler was a pretentious and materialistic German businessman who had becomes an unbelievable humanitarian amongst the brutal Nazi reign. When he feels compelled to turn his factory into a save haven for Jews. This is where he saved about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp or being gunned down. The film is done were tastefully in the black and white style except for one little girl that you see twice in this film. She is wearing a red coat the first time she is running down the road and then the second time in a wheelbarrow. This make a very large impact to the film in the way the meaning behind it being that she is alive in one scene and the next dead because she is a Jew. At this point Schindler knows that he most do something and something big. He had started off small and then wanted more. He felt that he never did enough he felt that he could have saved more. This film is done as tastefully as can be with the film showing what would happen to Jews in the time of World War II. With girls be raped and forced to do things that is wrong on so many different levels. Children being ripped away from there parents and forced in to slave labor, whose who were not able to work killed. Then so much more if the Jews would hide or try to run away being killed on the spot. That this time so many people wanted to do something but would not in fear of being killed, Schindler was the man who saved the most and wanted to help in the vastest way. This is a must see film and should be shown in school while teaching about World War II.

    Seriously talking, when I first tried to watch this movie I was surprised by the length (Over 3 hours) and that too in Black and White motion picture. I thought of leaving this movie. Then I thought of giving it a try taking into account that this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, a legend. I gave this movie two-three tries to watch but after watching 10 minutes I was taken aback every time due to its length. Finally, I thought of giving it a final try. That day me and my very good friend both started watching the movie at their own houses. After watching the initial 15 minutes, I was so engrossed in the movie I forgot everything that whether its in Black and White or its length. The complete 3 hours+ was a roller-coaster ride where I was spell bounded by the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and not to forget Ralph Fiennes. I was completely lost for the next few days only thinking about this movie, the direction of the Genius, Spielberg, the writers, etc. After watching the movie that night, Me and my friend talked over the phone and we both were speechless, watching this masterclass. A movie over Jews and Nazis during world war II, cannot be portrayed in a more beautiful way than this one. Some scenes will leave you stunned and might even cause you to lose faith over mankind. I will recommend this masterpiece to every movie lover who sees movie from their heart and loves watching masterpiece like these. This will for sure remain the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I love to watch it again and again. A full 10/10 for this one, as I don't see any flaw in this movie and Hats-Off for the legend STEVEN SPIELBERG!!! #Respect

    I cried throughout this entire film the first time I watched it. It was so moving and powerful. The ash from burning bodies raining down from the sky, and the little children hiding in the cesspit, and the men and women running around naked during the medial inspection in the courtyard. I just sat there and cried. And after the movie was finished I ran out and bought it on DVD but have not been able to watch it again. I just can't bring myself to watch it. I have had it for 6 years now still in the wrapper. This is how much the movie moved me. I am still in my 20's and like many have only read about the holocaust and it's hard to imagine what the Jews might have gone through, well this movie will paint a very clear picture for anyone who watches it. Spielberg is a genius on so many levels and he has been for some time now. I hope he continues to educate us with his many works of art.

    Everything about this film is amazing. From the acting to the cinematography... all of it is visually pleasing. More importantly the story itself is moving, and disturbing. while watching Schlinder's List, I found myself continuously (and unsuccessfully I might add) fighting back tears. I think this is a film that should be shown in film schools to illustrate how to make a great film. I applaud the Director Steven Spielberg for his incredible vision and brilliant story telling. The performance of each of actor the made me believe and feel their individual truths. Special credit goes to Liam Neeson for the transformation in his performance. The man is amazing!

    One of the best movies i have ever seen. Its depiction of the German war was absolutely brilliant, very detailed and well directed. A powerful and inspirational movie that shows the struggles of the Jews and the Atrocity of the Germans. Followed up by brilliant performances from Liam Neeson, Depicting the role of Oscar Schindler brilliantly, his acting was flawless and without a doubt the best i have seen. Also as brilliant as ever Ben Kingsley played Itzhak Stern and completely mastered the character. Ralph Fiennes also brilliantly characterized the role of Amon Goeth and nailed it. Overall the movie was a excellent example a masterpiece and to have a Director like Steven Spielberg, with his enormous experience and brilliant directing took the movie to the next level.

    During World War 2nd, Nazi was persecuting Hebrew. In such a situation, there was a man. Though he was German, he sheltered a lot of Hebrew by employing them as workers of his factory. He is Oskar Schindler. This film shows the story about him and what we must not forget forever. I have watched this film three times. When I did for the first time, I was an elementary school student. So then I couldn't understand anything about the film. But now I can and think it is worth watching so much, because it teaches us a lot of things that we should know. What Nazi did, of course, is very cruel and must not be repeated. We has to remember not only this but also people who did something merciful to help someone on the edge of death. They stand for justice, I think. The film has a lot of terrible scenes, so it is hard to see them. But they represent what happened in the real. Therefore I tried not to miss the portraits and remember them. Oskar Schindler is one of the people I really respect. If you don't know him, please watch this film.

    This is an amazing movie! It shows the hardship of the Jewish people during the holocaust. The movie shows the real brutality of the Nazi leaders and soldiers. Being in black and white it adds emotion to the movie. No one better than Liam Neeson could have acted the part of Oskar Schindler! Schindler's list is such a good movie I could easily watch it over and over. The only downside is it would have been interesting to see the movie in color but I do understand the reason why the movie is what it is. If you have not watched this movie and you are reading this review, you must watch it right away! This is also a good movie that would be good to show to teenagers in high school, to educate them about the holocaust.

    The film Schindler's List is a powerfully film, its one that give back so much more than just a film would. The actor Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler gives a performance of his life. Playing the role, as Oskar Schindler can be not small task, this film plays a big part in telling his story behind the man that saved so many lives. World War II was a very important part of history it took a brave to save all those people with the help of Itzhak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Schindler had made it so the Jews were put on a train and taken to his factory to work in order to save their lives. Schindler's List is set in the time of Would War II at the time when German Nazis soldiers under the command of Hitler. Oskar Schindler was a pretentious and materialistic German businessman who had becomes an unbelievable humanitarian amongst the brutal Nazi reign. When he feels compelled to turn his factory into a save haven for Jews. This is where he saved about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp or being gunned down. The film is done were tastefully in the black and white style except for one little girl that you see twice in this film. She is wearing a red coat the first time she is running down the road and then the second time in a wheelbarrow. This make a very large impact to the film in the way the meaning behind it being that she is alive in one scene and the next dead because she is a Jew. At this point Schindler knows that he most do something and something big. He had started off small and then wanted more. He felt that he never did enough he felt that he could have saved more. This film is done as tastefully as can be with the film showing what would happen to Jews in the time of World War II. With girls be raped and forced to do things that is wrong on so many different levels. Children being ripped away from there parents and forced in to slave labor, whose who were not able to work killed. Then so much more if the Jews would hide or try to run away being killed on the spot. That this time so many people wanted to do something but would not in fear of being killed, Schindler was the man who saved the most and wanted to help in the vastest way. This is a must see film and should be shown in school while teaching about World War II.

    Steven Spielberg won a well-deserved Academy Award(as did the film itself) for directing this emotionally shattering, dramatically devastating film about opportunistic businessman Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson in a superb performance) who goes into business with the Nazis, and Amon Goeth(Ralph Fiennes, unforgettable performance) the death camp commandant who supplies him with imprisoned Jews for his factories. Ben Kingsly plays Itzhak Stern, his secretary who helps Schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the Nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives. Masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the Jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite John Williams score), and Amon Goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid. The ending to the film when Schindler breaks down, and the Jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the Coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever. A stunning achievement for all concerned, especially Mr. Spielberg.

    Schindler's List is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline that takes its time telling a very long story but never fails to be interesting.The films cast is pitch perfect,its without a doubt one of Liam Neeson's most impressive performances,but I think the best performance has to go to Ralph Fiennes,his performance as Amon Goeth was unbelievably inspired and he put a lot of heart in to it.Obviously a lot of credit for making this film so beautiful is Steven Spielberg,easily one of the best directors of all time,he clearly has a huge interest in World War 2 and puts so much heart and effort into every film he makes.If your a fan of war and biography films and just a moviegoer in general,Schindler's List should not be missed. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson),a man sent out to exploit Jewish labor,finds himself unexpectedly risking everything to save lives.

    This film is an extraordinary tale of 1 man saving 1200 lives of persecuted Jews during the Holocaust. Oskar Schindler is shown initially as an opportunist industrialist who is out to make the most of the war.But as the war continues and as he witnesses the atrocities, he focuses of saving as many Jews as he can. The film has one of the most gripping and heart-touching portrayals of the Holocaust. The Nazi soldier Goeth is another character the viewer would find intriguing. The Jewish saying "Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire",is a pivotal element of the plot. The value of Human life is unequaled. The direction by Steven Spielberg,in combination with spectacular performances from Liam Neeson,Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes makes this movie an Epic to cherish.The B&W touch in the cinematography transcends the viewing experience to another plane.The score,which materializes the horrors and tragedy of the Holocaust,by John Williams deserves special mention.

    One of the best movies i have ever seen. Its depiction of the German war was absolutely brilliant, very detailed and well directed. A powerful and inspirational movie that shows the struggles of the Jews and the Atrocity of the Germans. Followed up by brilliant performances from Liam Neeson, Depicting the role of Oscar Schindler brilliantly, his acting was flawless and without a doubt the best i have seen. Also as brilliant as ever Ben Kingsley played Itzhak Stern and completely mastered the character. Ralph Fiennes also brilliantly characterized the role of Amon Goeth and nailed it. Overall the movie was a excellent example a masterpiece and to have a Director like Steven Spielberg, with his enormous experience and brilliant directing took the movie to the next level.

    During World War 2nd, Nazi was persecuting Hebrew. In such a situation, there was a man. Though he was German, he sheltered a lot of Hebrew by employing them as workers of his factory. He is Oskar Schindler. This film shows the story about him and what we must not forget forever. I have watched this film three times. When I did for the first time, I was an elementary school student. So then I couldn't understand anything about the film. But now I can and think it is worth watching so much, because it teaches us a lot of things that we should know. What Nazi did, of course, is very cruel and must not be repeated. We has to remember not only this but also people who did something merciful to help someone on the edge of death. They stand for justice, I think. The film has a lot of terrible scenes, so it is hard to see them. But they represent what happened in the real. Therefore I tried not to miss the portraits and remember them. Oskar Schindler is one of the people I really respect. If you don't know him, please watch this film.

    This is an amazing movie! It shows the hardship of the Jewish people during the holocaust. The movie shows the real brutality of the Nazi leaders and soldiers. Being in black and white it adds emotion to the movie. No one better than Liam Neeson could have acted the part of Oskar Schindler! Schindler's list is such a good movie I could easily watch it over and over. The only downside is it would have been interesting to see the movie in color but I do understand the reason why the movie is what it is. If you have not watched this movie and you are reading this review, you must watch it right away! This is also a good movie that would be good to show to teenagers in high school, to educate them about the holocaust.

    The film Schindler's List is a powerfully film, its one that give back so much more than just a film would. The actor Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler gives a performance of his life. Playing the role, as Oskar Schindler can be not small task, this film plays a big part in telling his story behind the man that saved so many lives. World War II was a very important part of history it took a brave to save all those people with the help of Itzhak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Schindler had made it so the Jews were put on a train and taken to his factory to work in order to save their lives. Schindler's List is set in the time of Would War II at the time when German Nazis soldiers under the command of Hitler. Oskar Schindler was a pretentious and materialistic German businessman who had becomes an unbelievable humanitarian amongst the brutal Nazi reign. When he feels compelled to turn his factory into a save haven for Jews. This is where he saved about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp or being gunned down. The film is done were tastefully in the black and white style except for one little girl that you see twice in this film. She is wearing a red coat the first time she is running down the road and then the second time in a wheelbarrow. This make a very large impact to the film in the way the meaning behind it being that she is alive in one scene and the next dead because she is a Jew. At this point Schindler knows that he most do something and something big. He had started off small and then wanted more. He felt that he never did enough he felt that he could have saved more. This film is done as tastefully as can be with the film showing what would happen to Jews in the time of World War II. With girls be raped and forced to do things that is wrong on so many different levels. Children being ripped away from there parents and forced in to slave labor, whose who were not able to work killed. Then so much more if the Jews would hide or try to run away being killed on the spot. That this time so many people wanted to do something but would not in fear of being killed, Schindler was the man who saved the most and wanted to help in the vastest way. This is a must see film and should be shown in school while teaching about World War II.

    Steven Spielberg won a well-deserved Academy Award(as did the film itself) for directing this emotionally shattering, dramatically devastating film about opportunistic businessman Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson in a superb performance) who goes into business with the Nazis, and Amon Goeth(Ralph Fiennes, unforgettable performance) the death camp commandant who supplies him with imprisoned Jews for his factories. Ben Kingsly plays Itzhak Stern, his secretary who helps Schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the Nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives. Masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the Jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite John Williams score), and Amon Goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid. The ending to the film when Schindler breaks down, and the Jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the Coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever. A stunning achievement for all concerned, especially Mr. Spielberg.

    Schindler's List is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline that takes its time telling a very long story but never fails to be interesting.The films cast is pitch perfect,its without a doubt one of Liam Neeson's most impressive performances,but I think the best performance has to go to Ralph Fiennes,his performance as Amon Goeth was unbelievably inspired and he put a lot of heart in to it.Obviously a lot of credit for making this film so beautiful is Steven Spielberg,easily one of the best directors of all time,he clearly has a huge interest in World War 2 and puts so much heart and effort into every film he makes.If your a fan of war and biography films and just a moviegoer in general,Schindler's List should not be missed. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson),a man sent out to exploit Jewish labor,finds himself unexpectedly risking everything to save lives.

    This film is an extraordinary tale of 1 man saving 1200 lives of persecuted Jews during the Holocaust. Oskar Schindler is shown initially as an opportunist industrialist who is out to make the most of the war.But as the war continues and as he witnesses the atrocities, he focuses of saving as many Jews as he can. The film has one of the most gripping and heart-touching portrayals of the Holocaust. The Nazi soldier Goeth is another character the viewer would find intriguing. The Jewish saying "Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire",is a pivotal element of the plot. The value of Human life is unequaled. The direction by Steven Spielberg,in combination with spectacular performances from Liam Neeson,Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes makes this movie an Epic to cherish.The B&W touch in the cinematography transcends the viewing experience to another plane.The score,which materializes the horrors and tragedy of the Holocaust,by John Williams deserves special mention.

    Seriously talking, when I first tried to watch this movie I was surprised by the length (Over 3 hours) and that too in Black and White motion picture. I thought of leaving this movie. Then I thought of giving it a try taking into account that this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, a legend. I gave this movie two-three tries to watch but after watching 10 minutes I was taken aback every time due to its length. Finally, I thought of giving it a final try. That day me and my very good friend both started watching the movie at their own houses. After watching the initial 15 minutes, I was so engrossed in the movie I forgot everything that whether its in Black and White or its length. The complete 3 hours+ was a roller-coaster ride where I was spell bounded by the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and not to forget Ralph Fiennes. I was completely lost for the next few days only thinking about this movie, the direction of the Genius, Spielberg, the writers, etc. After watching the movie that night, Me and my friend talked over the phone and we both were speechless, watching this masterclass. A movie over Jews and Nazis during world war II, cannot be portrayed in a more beautiful way than this one. Some scenes will leave you stunned and might even cause you to lose faith over mankind. I will recommend this masterpiece to every movie lover who sees movie from their heart and loves watching masterpiece like these. This will for sure remain the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I love to watch it again and again. A full 10/10 for this one, as I don't see any flaw in this movie and Hats-Off for the legend STEVEN SPIELBERG!!! #Respect

    I cried throughout this entire film the first time I watched it. It was so moving and powerful. The ash from burning bodies raining down from the sky, and the little children hiding in the cesspit, and the men and women running around naked during the medial inspection in the courtyard. I just sat there and cried. And after the movie was finished I ran out and bought it on DVD but have not been able to watch it again. I just can't bring myself to watch it. I have had it for 6 years now still in the wrapper. This is how much the movie moved me. I am still in my 20's and like many have only read about the holocaust and it's hard to imagine what the Jews might have gone through, well this movie will paint a very clear picture for anyone who watches it. Spielberg is a genius on so many levels and he has been for some time now. I hope he continues to educate us with his many works of art.

    Everything about this film is amazing. From the acting to the cinematography... all of it is visually pleasing. More importantly the story itself is moving, and disturbing. while watching Schlinder's List, I found myself continuously (and unsuccessfully I might add) fighting back tears. I think this is a film that should be shown in film schools to illustrate how to make a great film. I applaud the Director Steven Spielberg for his incredible vision and brilliant story telling. The performance of each of actor the made me believe and feel their individual truths. Special credit goes to Liam Neeson for the transformation in his performance. The man is amazing!
