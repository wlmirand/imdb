 <sinopse>
  A playboy becomes interested in the daughter of his family's chauffeur. But it's his more serious brother who would be the better man for her.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Linus and David Larrabee are the two sons of a very wealthy family. Linus is all work -- busily running the family corporate empire with no time for a wife and family. David is all play -- technically employed in the family business but never showing up for work, spending all his time entertaining, and having been married and divorced three times. Sabrina Fairchild is the young, shy, and awkward daughter of the household chauffeur, who has been infatuated with David all her life, but whom David hardly notices till she goes away to Paris for two years and returns an elegant, sophisticated, beautiful woman. Suddenly, she finds she's captured David's attention, but just as she does so, she finds herself also falling in love with Linus, and she finds that Linus is also falling in love with her.

    This movie is mostly for Hepburn fans, less so for Wilder acolytes, and has little if anything for Bogieists or Holdenites. Wilder is milder here than anywhere else (except maybe his other Audrey, Love in the Afternoon), leaving a little wit and cynicism scattered about to remind viewers who sat next to the camera. Bogie is uninvolved and uninvolving, reads his lines dutifully, and has NO chemistry with Hepburn. The only advantage of his casting (as opposed to Grant) is that the romance isn't a foregone conclusion--Bogie's romantic days were behind him. And shoulda stayed there. Holden is 10 years and several previous Wilders too old for his carefree playboy--the bad bleach job just makes him look older. At least he and AH have some on-screen chemistry (and a lot more off-screen). Not much of a comedy, all in all, and no romance. Audrey carries it, and carries it off, both with ease

    In terms of the plot and story, the movie is good, it develops slowly and while often things appear to be strange, they do make sense at the end. Light entertaining movie, Audry Hepburn, anyone will fall in love with her! I am rating it 4, because the movie seemed to be ordinary, and just found the ending sick. Please don't read from here, if don't want to know the climax. Just because, someone is rich, caring, doesn't mean he can become a husband. He's fatherly for her. His demeanor, personality, and shrewdness is often cheap and while looking at the role of 22-years old Audry Hepburn, he doesn't seem to be suitable for her. On this count, the movie did disappointed and left a bitter feeling at the end. Even if they could have shown it, her leaving David (and Linus too), that would have appeared more graceful. It would have portrayed the feelings of female pride, independence, yet tender nature.

    SABRINA I thought it was not a bad movie. It is the kind of movie that is nice to put on on a wet Sunday afternoon. I only recorded this movie from the TV because it has Audrey Hepburn in it. She was a great actress. I have not seen many of her movies, but I intend to watch more. Sabrina is played by Audrey. She is a chauffeur's daughter who has loved the son of her fathers rich employer since she was a little girl. The only problem, he looks right past her and takes no notice of her, until... she leaves for Paris to get over him. But when she comes back 2 years later... he is smitten. But so is his brother. I thought the story was quite good and the acting was good also. But then it should have. It had some big names from it's time. Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart & William Holden. Like I said... this movie is good for a wet weekend... but it is not really a film I could watch over and over. I will probably watch this again in a few years when I have forgotten it. For Audrey... out of the 3 films I have seen of hers so far... this is the worst. But it is still good. I will give this film a 6 out of 10. Roman Holiday for me is still her best.

    Long Island is the place where the wealthy Larabees live. The family consists of four people, father and mother and two sons, David and Linus. They have anything you can imagine at their mansion, big rooms, sports grounds, luxurious cars, and so on. Life there is like life in paradise. They have a chauffeur called Fairchild who has a shy, awkward, very young daughter called Sabrina. Sabrina has been in love with David, the younger boy, all her life. David is a playboy who has been married three times and divorced every time. She is afraid of telling him about her feelings towards him. She is supposed to be sent to Paris to learn how to cook. The night before her journey to Paris, she sees David dancing with a girl and decides to commit suicide, but Linus stops her. On her journey to Paris, she learns how to live and love instead of learning how to cook, and she decides to take part in life instead of watching it. So she comes back as a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. David, who hardly noticed her existence at Long Island falls in love with her. Naturally his family objects to this relationship and Linus, David's brother, plans something to get rid of this situation. He tries to make her fall in love with him himself, and they really fall in love. Sabrina who has been in pain and agony of David's love all her life finally finds a cure, but she has to deal with the cure now. It seems the cure for a love is another love, so love is incurable and inevitable. As she says herself " I don't want to run away from life any more." David finds out about her and his brother. Then he, who knows much more about love than his bother who has been working on business all his life and never felt such feelings, decides to help them get to each other. Finally Sabrina goes back to Paris, where she found how to love, with her love.

    "Sabrina" (1954) and "Roman Holiday" (1953) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    When I watch this film, I'm a little sad that Humphrey Bogart spent so much of his career -- particularly in the 1930s -- on rather shallow thug roles. The forties were his heyday with a number of outstanding parts, and in the 1950s there were a few particularly impressive films -- "The Caine Mutiny" and "The African Queen"...both favorites of mine. But perhaps I enjoy Bogart even more in this film because he is cast against type -- it's a rather gentle, light comedy/drama role. And he is so very good here! I also tend to think that one of the reasons he fit so nicely in this role was that in his youth he was somewhat privileged, his family living in New York's fashionable Upper West Side, and summering at a 55 acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in New York State -- just 12 miles from my home town. This is one of a handful of films (including those previously mentioned, along with "Casablanca") that if not made with Bogart would have made his filmography weaker. But this film also belongs to Audrey Hepburn...one of her earliest major roles. And, she shines it it...particularly in terms of at the beginning of the film playing a girl who then grows up and becomes very sophisticated while in Paris. A wonderful, wonderful role...and I say that as not a particular fan of Hepburn. And then there's William Holden, who comes off third in this film, though he does so pleasantly. He's very likable here, although he had many other films that were much stronger for hi. The supporting cast is excellent, as well. Worth noting are character actors Walter Hampden and John Williams. They add much to the production. I rarely give an "8", but here I will. This is a gem, and it's definitely on my DVD shelf!

    There are a lot of great reviews posted about this movie -- Don't trust them. I am a big fan of Audrey Hepburn, and a fan of Bogart and Billy Wilder.. Sabrina does none of them justice. In Sabrina (played by Audrey Hepburn) the title character has the emotional maturity of a 13 year old girl. That's okay in a sense, because films are about growing as a person.. but her character only ever grows in superficial ways, entirely subject to the whims of circumstance. No one in this film really knows what they want. The characters are all extremely weak. There are only about 3 or 4 lines where Bogart sounds like himself. It's kind of slow and a little boring. Honestly I only finished watching this movie because I know that Billy Wilder can deliver, and I'm glad I finished it. The ending was good, but overall this movie was definitely below average. There are many films out there I've found to be a lot more satisfying. Charade, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 7 year itch were all better.

    What an incredible cast for this movie! You have Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, AND Bill Holden?? How could this not be a wonderful film? So much better than "Sabrina" with Harrison Ford back in the 90's. This was, and always will be the original. And it is. If you like classic romantic comedy, or you love Audrey Hepburn, you will certainly enjoy this one. It is not an overly subtle movie, and the characters sometimes change their whole outlook quite suddenly, but this is fairly common of the genre, and is not a particular flaw of this movie. If you are more interested in classics or Audrey Hepburn than romantic comedy, then you probably won't like the 1995 remake. If, however, you enjoy romantic comedy in general, and are willing to accept that they are not the same movie, I believe you may enjoy the remake even more than the original. I did, and I adore Audrey Hepburn.

    The scenario is set up whereby a well to do Long Island Family, with all the social register trappings of success and prominence, wind up purporting their New York societal clout through lavish parties! These parties exude a facade of pecuniary omnipotence from the benevolent aristocracy, via the Larabee family. Amidst all the accoutrement of the wealthy Larabee household, are a chauffeur and his daughter who live above the garage of this domicile which houses eight beautiful cars. Now what? The daughter (Audrey Hepburn) develops a precocious crush on one of the Larabees, David (William Holden). All of this is very natural for a susceptible, barely out of adolescence, emotionally distraught female. She is fixated on a young, good looking, devil may care bachelor of a plutocratic offspring. The initial dilemma for Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is that David does not really even notice her, however, after she spends two years in Paris, she returns, and, David becomes seriously intrigued with the woman, Sabrina, as opposed to the girl, Sabrina, he knew a couple of years back, whom he never paid attention to. Therefore, Sabrina's love interest of idealism with David has resonated to fruition, thus making Sabrina's childhood heart throb,her potentially significant other.. "Isn't it Romantic?" (Just like the song which was ubiquitously playing throughout the film). So, what's the glitch to this entire panacea? Meet the brother.. Linus,(Humphrey Bogart), and now, for Sabrina, it becomes a proverbial instance of choosing between impetuous passion vs debenture bonds. At first, the fiscally responsible brother, who is running the Larabee empire, Linus Larabee, (Humphrey Bogart) escorts Sabrina around, only in a perfunctory capacity as a result of David's hapless absence. Invariably, a relationship manifests itself between Linus and Sabrina, (Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart), however, it does not involve hanky-panky, it merely entails a largess of candid conversation: The gist of these conversations being along the line of " You saved me from being ravaged by carbon monoxide": "All I can think about is the plastics' merger": "I can make a souffl&eacute; out of oyster crackers": "What's French for where's my sister's yellow pencil?": "Paris is the city for lovers, that's why I spent only 35 minutes there"; and finally, "If you caught in the rain in Paris, leave your hat and umbrella at home". Sabrina is afflicted by an impressionable infatuation, for David, and for Paris, however, the acutely insightful reality pertaining to the relationship she has with Linus, (Humphrey Bogart) ultimately puts infatuation in its proper perspective. Romance games lose out to the auspicious necessity of cultivating a simple human understanding of one another. Such a characteristic is an indelible element in human behavior which establishes the ultimate foundation for true love! This film, "Sabrina", contains a wealth of talent both on and off the screen. It stars: Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and Wiliam Holden. Writers and directors are listed as follows: Samuel Taylor (Writer of the stage play, "Sabrina") Ernest Lehman (Known for works such as; "North By Northwest", "The Sweet Smell of Success" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") and last ,and most importantly: Billy Wilder (Known for a bevy of classics, including "Sunset Boulevard" and "Double Indemnity"). This film is a fabulously witty romantic comedy! The remake with Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear was testament to the fact that "Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery". When it comes to the precarious remora of relationships, many encompassing aspects include; money, intense lovemaking, and dangerously idealistic cavorting.. "Isn't it Romantic?", Yet, when it comes to truly being in love: "Isn't it Utterly Human?". I give this film: Five Stars- An absolutely, emphatically, perfect ten flick!

    Girl loves boy. Boy ignores girl. Girl returns home. Boy lusts over girl. You get the picture. It may sound unoriginal, but there's a little darkness floating throughout Sabrina that makes it gripping. Not every love story starts with a suicide attempt. Nor does the girl become attracted to the more sensible, if less fun, of two brothers. Sabrina is a comedy that deals with social class, but not in a patronizing way. She isn't the poor little flower generously allowed into the family. She's a hardworking girl and the men realise how lucky they are. Bogart is slightly miscast (mostly due to his age), but the trio of him, Hepburn, and Holden is miraculous, despite rumors of offscreen tension. Holden is charming, and comes across as a lusty younger man, rather than the complete sleaze many could perceive him as. Bogart is logical, smart, with a slight cruel sense of humor. It amounts to a brotherly relationship full of love, but also a bit of rivalry and hate. The film works by removing any antagonist, and making love the antagonist itself. This means we are watching people wrestle for attention and admiration and, as the audience, we generally want people to make the right choices and be happy. Another great Hepburn classic.

But perhaps I enjoy Bogart even more in this film because he is cast against type -- it's a rather gentle, light comedy/drama role. And he is so very good here! I also tend to think that one of the reasons he fit so nicely in this role was that in his youth he was somewhat privileged, his family living in New York's fashionable Upper West Side, and summering at a 55 acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in New York State -- just 12 miles from my home town. This is one of a handful of films (including those previously mentioned, along with "Casablanca") that if not made with Bogart would have made his filmography weaker. But this film also belongs to Audrey Hepburn...one of her earliest major roles. And, she shines it it...particularly in terms of at the beginning of the film playing a girl who then grows up and becomes very sophisticated while in Paris. A wonderful, wonderful role...and I say that as not a particular fan of Hepburn. And then there's William Holden, who comes off third in this film, though he does so pleasantly. He's very likable here, although he had many other films that were much stronger for hi. The supporting cast is excellent, as well. Worth noting are character actors Walter Hampden and John Williams. They add much to the production. I rarely give an "8", but here I will. This is a gem, and it's definitely on my DVD shelf!

    There are a lot of great reviews posted about this movie -- Don't trust them. I am a big fan of Audrey Hepburn, and a fan of Bogart and Billy Wilder.. Sabrina does none of them justice. In Sabrina (played by Audrey Hepburn) the title character has the emotional maturity of a 13 year old girl. That's okay in a sense, because films are about growing as a person.. but her character only ever grows in superficial ways, entirely subject to the whims of circumstance. No one in this film really knows what they want. The characters are all extremely weak. There are only about 3 or 4 lines where Bogart sounds like himself. It's kind of slow and a little boring. Honestly I only finished watching this movie because I know that Billy Wilder can deliver, and I'm glad I finished it. The ending was good, but overall this movie was definitely below average. There are many films out there I've found to be a lot more satisfying. Charade, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 7 year itch were all better.

    What an incredible cast for this movie! You have Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, AND Bill Holden?? How could this not be a wonderful film? So much better than "Sabrina" with Harrison Ford back in the 90's. This was, and always will be the original. And it is. If you like classic romantic comedy, or you love Audrey Hepburn, you will certainly enjoy this one. It is not an overly subtle movie, and the characters sometimes change their whole outlook quite suddenly, but this is fairly common of the genre, and is not a particular flaw of this movie. If you are more interested in classics or Audrey Hepburn than romantic comedy, then you probably won't like the 1995 remake. If, however, you enjoy romantic comedy in general, and are willing to accept that they are not the same movie, I believe you may enjoy the remake even more than the original. I did, and I adore Audrey Hepburn.

    The scenario is set up whereby a well to do Long Island Family, with all the social register trappings of success and prominence, wind up purporting their New York societal clout through lavish parties! These parties exude a facade of pecuniary omnipotence from the benevolent aristocracy, via the Larabee family. Amidst all the accoutrement of the wealthy Larabee household, are a chauffeur and his daughter who live above the garage of this domicile which houses eight beautiful cars. Now what? The daughter (Audrey Hepburn) develops a precocious crush on one of the Larabees, David (William Holden). All of this is very natural for a susceptible, barely out of adolescence, emotionally distraught female. She is fixated on a young, good looking, devil may care bachelor of a plutocratic offspring. The initial dilemma for Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is that David does not really even notice her, however, after she spends two years in Paris, she returns, and, David becomes seriously intrigued with the woman, Sabrina, as opposed to the girl, Sabrina, he knew a couple of years back, whom he never paid attention to. Therefore, Sabrina's love interest of idealism with David has resonated to fruition, thus making Sabrina's childhood heart throb,her potentially significant other.. "Isn't it Romantic?" (Just like the song which was ubiquitously playing throughout the film). So, what's the glitch to this entire panacea? Meet the brother.. Linus,(Humphrey Bogart), and now, for Sabrina, it becomes a proverbial instance of choosing between impetuous passion vs debenture bonds. At first, the fiscally responsible brother, who is running the Larabee empire, Linus Larabee, (Humphrey Bogart) escorts Sabrina around, only in a perfunctory capacity as a result of David's hapless absence. Invariably, a relationship manifests itself between Linus and Sabrina, (Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart), however, it does not involve hanky-panky, it merely entails a largess of candid conversation: The gist of these conversations being along the line of " You saved me from being ravaged by carbon monoxide": "All I can think about is the plastics' merger": "I can make a souffl&eacute; out of oyster crackers": "What's French for where's my sister's yellow pencil?": "Paris is the city for lovers, that's why I spent only 35 minutes there"; and finally, "If you caught in the rain in Paris, leave your hat and umbrella at home". Sabrina is afflicted by an impressionable infatuation, for David, and for Paris, however, the acutely insightful reality pertaining to the relationship she has with Linus, (Humphrey Bogart) ultimately puts infatuation in its proper perspective. Romance games lose out to the auspicious necessity of cultivating a simple human understanding of one another. Such a characteristic is an indelible element in human behavior which establishes the ultimate foundation for true love! This film, "Sabrina", contains a wealth of talent both on and off the screen. It stars: Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and Wiliam Holden. Writers and directors are listed as follows: Samuel Taylor (Writer of the stage play, "Sabrina") Ernest Lehman (Known for works such as; "North By Northwest", "The Sweet Smell of Success" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") and last ,and most importantly: Billy Wilder (Known for a bevy of classics, including "Sunset Boulevard" and "Double Indemnity"). This film is a fabulously witty romantic comedy! The remake with Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear was testament to the fact that "Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery". When it comes to the precarious remora of relationships, many encompassing aspects include; money, intense lovemaking, and dangerously idealistic cavorting.. "Isn't it Romantic?", Yet, when it comes to truly being in love: "Isn't it Utterly Human?". I give this film: Five Stars- An absolutely, emphatically, perfect ten flick!

    Girl loves boy. Boy ignores girl. Girl returns home. Boy lusts over girl. You get the picture. It may sound unoriginal, but there's a little darkness floating throughout Sabrina that makes it gripping. Not every love story starts with a suicide attempt. Nor does the girl become attracted to the more sensible, if less fun, of two brothers. Sabrina is a comedy that deals with social class, but not in a patronizing way. She isn't the poor little flower generously allowed into the family. She's a hardworking girl and the men realise how lucky they are. Bogart is slightly miscast (mostly due to his age), but the trio of him, Hepburn, and Holden is miraculous, despite rumors of offscreen tension. Holden is charming, and comes across as a lusty younger man, rather than the complete sleaze many could perceive him as. Bogart is logical, smart, with a slight cruel sense of humor. It amounts to a brotherly relationship full of love, but also a bit of rivalry and hate. The film works by removing any antagonist, and making love the antagonist itself. This means we are watching people wrestle for attention and admiration and, as the audience, we generally want people to make the right choices and be happy. Another great Hepburn classic.

    This movie is mostly for Hepburn fans, less so for Wilder acolytes, and has little if anything for Bogieists or Holdenites. Wilder is milder here than anywhere else (except maybe his other Audrey, Love in the Afternoon), leaving a little wit and cynicism scattered about to remind viewers who sat next to the camera. Bogie is uninvolved and uninvolving, reads his lines dutifully, and has NO chemistry with Hepburn. The only advantage of his casting (as opposed to Grant) is that the romance isn't a foregone conclusion--Bogie's romantic days were behind him. And shoulda stayed there. Holden is 10 years and several previous Wilders too old for his carefree playboy--the bad bleach job just makes him look older. At least he and AH have some on-screen chemistry (and a lot more off-screen). Not much of a comedy, all in all, and no romance. Audrey carries it, and carries it off, both with ease

    In terms of the plot and story, the movie is good, it develops slowly and while often things appear to be strange, they do make sense at the end. Light entertaining movie, Audry Hepburn, anyone will fall in love with her! I am rating it 4, because the movie seemed to be ordinary, and just found the ending sick. Please don't read from here, if don't want to know the climax. Just because, someone is rich, caring, doesn't mean he can become a husband. He's fatherly for her. His demeanor, personality, and shrewdness is often cheap and while looking at the role of 22-years old Audry Hepburn, he doesn't seem to be suitable for her. On this count, the movie did disappointed and left a bitter feeling at the end. Even if they could have shown it, her leaving David (and Linus too), that would have appeared more graceful. It would have portrayed the feelings of female pride, independence, yet tender nature.

    SABRINA I thought it was not a bad movie. It is the kind of movie that is nice to put on on a wet Sunday afternoon. I only recorded this movie from the TV because it has Audrey Hepburn in it. She was a great actress. I have not seen many of her movies, but I intend to watch more. Sabrina is played by Audrey. She is a chauffeur's daughter who has loved the son of her fathers rich employer since she was a little girl. The only problem, he looks right past her and takes no notice of her, until... she leaves for Paris to get over him. But when she comes back 2 years later... he is smitten. But so is his brother. I thought the story was quite good and the acting was good also. But then it should have. It had some big names from it's time. Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart & William Holden. Like I said... this movie is good for a wet weekend... but it is not really a film I could watch over and over. I will probably watch this again in a few years when I have forgotten it. For Audrey... out of the 3 films I have seen of hers so far... this is the worst. But it is still good. I will give this film a 6 out of 10. Roman Holiday for me is still her best.

    Long Island is the place where the wealthy Larabees live. The family consists of four people, father and mother and two sons, David and Linus. They have anything you can imagine at their mansion, big rooms, sports grounds, luxurious cars, and so on. Life there is like life in paradise. They have a chauffeur called Fairchild who has a shy, awkward, very young daughter called Sabrina. Sabrina has been in love with David, the younger boy, all her life. David is a playboy who has been married three times and divorced every time. She is afraid of telling him about her feelings towards him. She is supposed to be sent to Paris to learn how to cook. The night before her journey to Paris, she sees David dancing with a girl and decides to commit suicide, but Linus stops her. On her journey to Paris, she learns how to live and love instead of learning how to cook, and she decides to take part in life instead of watching it. So she comes back as a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. David, who hardly noticed her existence at Long Island falls in love with her. Naturally his family objects to this relationship and Linus, David's brother, plans something to get rid of this situation. He tries to make her fall in love with him himself, and they really fall in love. Sabrina who has been in pain and agony of David's love all her life finally finds a cure, but she has to deal with the cure now. It seems the cure for a love is another love, so love is incurable and inevitable. As she says herself " I don't want to run away from life any more." David finds out about her and his brother. Then he, who knows much more about love than his bother who has been working on business all his life and never felt such feelings, decides to help them get to each other. Finally Sabrina goes back to Paris, where she found how to love, with her love.

    "Sabrina" (1954) and "Roman Holiday" (1953) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

She was a great actress. I have not seen many of her movies, but I intend to watch more. Sabrina is played by Audrey. She is a chauffeur's daughter who has loved the son of her fathers rich employer since she was a little girl. The only problem, he looks right past her and takes no notice of her, until... she leaves for Paris to get over him. But when she comes back 2 years later... he is smitten. But so is his brother. I thought the story was quite good and the acting was good also. But then it should have. It had some big names from it's time. Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart & William Holden. Like I said... this movie is good for a wet weekend... but it is not really a film I could watch over and over. I will probably watch this again in a few years when I have forgotten it. For Audrey... out of the 3 films I have seen of hers so far... this is the worst. But it is still good. I will give this film a 6 out of 10. Roman Holiday for me is still her best.

    Long Island is the place where the wealthy Larabees live. The family consists of four people, father and mother and two sons, David and Linus. They have anything you can imagine at their mansion, big rooms, sports grounds, luxurious cars, and so on. Life there is like life in paradise. They have a chauffeur called Fairchild who has a shy, awkward, very young daughter called Sabrina. Sabrina has been in love with David, the younger boy, all her life. David is a playboy who has been married three times and divorced every time. She is afraid of telling him about her feelings towards him. She is supposed to be sent to Paris to learn how to cook. The night before her journey to Paris, she sees David dancing with a girl and decides to commit suicide, but Linus stops her. On her journey to Paris, she learns how to live and love instead of learning how to cook, and she decides to take part in life instead of watching it. So she comes back as a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. David, who hardly noticed her existence at Long Island falls in love with her. Naturally his family objects to this relationship and Linus, David's brother, plans something to get rid of this situation. He tries to make her fall in love with him himself, and they really fall in love. Sabrina who has been in pain and agony of David's love all her life finally finds a cure, but she has to deal with the cure now. It seems the cure for a love is another love, so love is incurable and inevitable. As she says herself " I don't want to run away from life any more." David finds out about her and his brother. Then he, who knows much more about love than his bother who has been working on business all his life and never felt such feelings, decides to help them get to each other. Finally Sabrina goes back to Paris, where she found how to love, with her love.

    "Sabrina" (1954) and "Roman Holiday" (1953) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    When I watch this film, I'm a little sad that Humphrey Bogart spent so much of his career -- particularly in the 1930s -- on rather shallow thug roles. The forties were his heyday with a number of outstanding parts, and in the 1950s there were a few particularly impressive films -- "The Caine Mutiny" and "The African Queen"...both favorites of mine. But perhaps I enjoy Bogart even more in this film because he is cast against type -- it's a rather gentle, light comedy/drama role. And he is so very good here! I also tend to think that one of the reasons he fit so nicely in this role was that in his youth he was somewhat privileged, his family living in New York's fashionable Upper West Side, and summering at a 55 acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in New York State -- just 12 miles from my home town. This is one of a handful of films (including those previously mentioned, along with "Casablanca") that if not made with Bogart would have made his filmography weaker. But this film also belongs to Audrey Hepburn...one of her earliest major roles. And, she shines it it...particularly in terms of at the beginning of the film playing a girl who then grows up and becomes very sophisticated while in Paris. A wonderful, wonderful role...and I say that as not a particular fan of Hepburn. And then there's William Holden, who comes off third in this film, though he does so pleasantly. He's very likable here, although he had many other films that were much stronger for hi. The supporting cast is excellent, as well. Worth noting are character actors Walter Hampden and John Williams. They add much to the production. I rarely give an "8", but here I will. This is a gem, and it's definitely on my DVD shelf!

    There are a lot of great reviews posted about this movie -- Don't trust them. I am a big fan of Audrey Hepburn, and a fan of Bogart and Billy Wilder.. Sabrina does none of them justice. In Sabrina (played by Audrey Hepburn) the title character has the emotional maturity of a 13 year old girl. That's okay in a sense, because films are about growing as a person.. but her character only ever grows in superficial ways, entirely subject to the whims of circumstance. No one in this film really knows what they want. The characters are all extremely weak. There are only about 3 or 4 lines where Bogart sounds like himself. It's kind of slow and a little boring. Honestly I only finished watching this movie because I know that Billy Wilder can deliver, and I'm glad I finished it. The ending was good, but overall this movie was definitely below average. There are many films out there I've found to be a lot more satisfying. Charade, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 7 year itch were all better.

    What an incredible cast for this movie! You have Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, AND Bill Holden?? How could this not be a wonderful film? So much better than "Sabrina" with Harrison Ford back in the 90's. This was, and always will be the original. And it is. If you like classic romantic comedy, or you love Audrey Hepburn, you will certainly enjoy this one. It is not an overly subtle movie, and the characters sometimes change their whole outlook quite suddenly, but this is fairly common of the genre, and is not a particular flaw of this movie. If you are more interested in classics or Audrey Hepburn than romantic comedy, then you probably won't like the 1995 remake. If, however, you enjoy romantic comedy in general, and are willing to accept that they are not the same movie, I believe you may enjoy the remake even more than the original. I did, and I adore Audrey Hepburn.

    The scenario is set up whereby a well to do Long Island Family, with all the social register trappings of success and prominence, wind up purporting their New York societal clout through lavish parties! These parties exude a facade of pecuniary omnipotence from the benevolent aristocracy, via the Larabee family. Amidst all the accoutrement of the wealthy Larabee household, are a chauffeur and his daughter who live above the garage of this domicile which houses eight beautiful cars. Now what? The daughter (Audrey Hepburn) develops a precocious crush on one of the Larabees, David (William Holden). All of this is very natural for a susceptible, barely out of adolescence, emotionally distraught female. She is fixated on a young, good looking, devil may care bachelor of a plutocratic offspring. The initial dilemma for Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is that David does not really even notice her, however, after she spends two years in Paris, she returns, and, David becomes seriously intrigued with the woman, Sabrina, as opposed to the girl, Sabrina, he knew a couple of years back, whom he never paid attention to. Therefore, Sabrina's love interest of idealism with David has resonated to fruition, thus making Sabrina's childhood heart throb,her potentially significant other.. "Isn't it Romantic?" (Just like the song which was ubiquitously playing throughout the film). So, what's the glitch to this entire panacea? Meet the brother.. Linus,(Humphrey Bogart), and now, for Sabrina, it becomes a proverbial instance of choosing between impetuous passion vs debenture bonds. At first, the fiscally responsible brother, who is running the Larabee empire, Linus Larabee, (Humphrey Bogart) escorts Sabrina around, only in a perfunctory capacity as a result of David's hapless absence. Invariably, a relationship manifests itself between Linus and Sabrina, (Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart), however, it does not involve hanky-panky, it merely entails a largess of candid conversation: The gist of these conversations being along the line of " You saved me from being ravaged by carbon monoxide": "All I can think about is the plastics' merger": "I can make a souffl&eacute; out of oyster crackers": "What's French for where's my sister's yellow pencil?": "Paris is the city for lovers, that's why I spent only 35 minutes there"; and finally, "If you caught in the rain in Paris, leave your hat and umbrella at home". Sabrina is afflicted by an impressionable infatuation, for David, and for Paris, however, the acutely insightful reality pertaining to the relationship she has with Linus, (Humphrey Bogart) ultimately puts infatuation in its proper perspective. Romance games lose out to the auspicious necessity of cultivating a simple human understanding of one another. Such a characteristic is an indelible element in human behavior which establishes the ultimate foundation for true love! This film, "Sabrina", contains a wealth of talent both on and off the screen. It stars: Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and Wiliam Holden. Writers and directors are listed as follows: Samuel Taylor (Writer of the stage play, "Sabrina") Ernest Lehman (Known for works such as; "North By Northwest", "The Sweet Smell of Success" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") and last ,and most importantly: Billy Wilder (Known for a bevy of classics, including "Sunset Boulevard" and "Double Indemnity"). This film is a fabulously witty romantic comedy! The remake with Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear was testament to the fact that "Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery". When it comes to the precarious remora of relationships, many encompassing aspects include; money, intense lovemaking, and dangerously idealistic cavorting.. "Isn't it Romantic?", Yet, when it comes to truly being in love: "Isn't it Utterly Human?". I give this film: Five Stars- An absolutely, emphatically, perfect ten flick!

    Girl loves boy. Boy ignores girl. Girl returns home. Boy lusts over girl. You get the picture. It may sound unoriginal, but there's a little darkness floating throughout Sabrina that makes it gripping. Not every love story starts with a suicide attempt. Nor does the girl become attracted to the more sensible, if less fun, of two brothers. Sabrina is a comedy that deals with social class, but not in a patronizing way. She isn't the poor little flower generously allowed into the family. She's a hardworking girl and the men realise how lucky they are. Bogart is slightly miscast (mostly due to his age), but the trio of him, Hepburn, and Holden is miraculous, despite rumors of offscreen tension. Holden is charming, and comes across as a lusty younger man, rather than the complete sleaze many could perceive him as. Bogart is logical, smart, with a slight cruel sense of humor. It amounts to a brotherly relationship full of love, but also a bit of rivalry and hate. The film works by removing any antagonist, and making love the antagonist itself. This means we are watching people wrestle for attention and admiration and, as the audience, we generally want people to make the right choices and be happy. Another great Hepburn classic.

    This movie is mostly for Hepburn fans, less so for Wilder acolytes, and has little if anything for Bogieists or Holdenites. Wilder is milder here than anywhere else (except maybe his other Audrey, Love in the Afternoon), leaving a little wit and cynicism scattered about to remind viewers who sat next to the camera. Bogie is uninvolved and uninvolving, reads his lines dutifully, and has NO chemistry with Hepburn. The only advantage of his casting (as opposed to Grant) is that the romance isn't a foregone conclusion--Bogie's romantic days were behind him. And shoulda stayed there. Holden is 10 years and several previous Wilders too old for his carefree playboy--the bad bleach job just makes him look older. At least he and AH have some on-screen chemistry (and a lot more off-screen). Not much of a comedy, all in all, and no romance. Audrey carries it, and carries it off, both with ease

    In terms of the plot and story, the movie is good, it develops slowly and while often things appear to be strange, they do make sense at the end. Light entertaining movie, Audry Hepburn, anyone will fall in love with her! I am rating it 4, because the movie seemed to be ordinary, and just found the ending sick. Please don't read from here, if don't want to know the climax. Just because, someone is rich, caring, doesn't mean he can become a husband. He's fatherly for her. His demeanor, personality, and shrewdness is often cheap and while looking at the role of 22-years old Audry Hepburn, he doesn't seem to be suitable for her. On this count, the movie did disappointed and left a bitter feeling at the end. Even if they could have shown it, her leaving David (and Linus too), that would have appeared more graceful. It would have portrayed the feelings of female pride, independence, yet tender nature.

Linus,(Humphrey Bogart), and now, for Sabrina, it becomes a proverbial instance of choosing between impetuous passion vs debenture bonds. At first, the fiscally responsible brother, who is running the Larabee empire, Linus Larabee, (Humphrey Bogart) escorts Sabrina around, only in a perfunctory capacity as a result of David's hapless absence. Invariably, a relationship manifests itself between Linus and Sabrina, (Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart), however, it does not involve hanky-panky, it merely entails a largess of candid conversation: The gist of these conversations being along the line of " You saved me from being ravaged by carbon monoxide": "All I can think about is the plastics' merger": "I can make a souffl&eacute; out of oyster crackers": "What's French for where's my sister's yellow pencil?": "Paris is the city for lovers, that's why I spent only 35 minutes there"; and finally, "If you caught in the rain in Paris, leave your hat and umbrella at home". Sabrina is afflicted by an impressionable infatuation, for David, and for Paris, however, the acutely insightful reality pertaining to the relationship she has with Linus, (Humphrey Bogart) ultimately puts infatuation in its proper perspective. Romance games lose out to the auspicious necessity of cultivating a simple human understanding of one another. Such a characteristic is an indelible element in human behavior which establishes the ultimate foundation for true love! This film, "Sabrina", contains a wealth of talent both on and off the screen. It stars: Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and Wiliam Holden. Writers and directors are listed as follows: Samuel Taylor (Writer of the stage play, "Sabrina") Ernest Lehman (Known for works such as; "North By Northwest", "The Sweet Smell of Success" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") and last ,and most importantly: Billy Wilder (Known for a bevy of classics, including "Sunset Boulevard" and "Double Indemnity"). This film is a fabulously witty romantic comedy! The remake with Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear was testament to the fact that "Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery". When it comes to the precarious remora of relationships, many encompassing aspects include; money, intense lovemaking, and dangerously idealistic cavorting.. "Isn't it Romantic?", Yet, when it comes to truly being in love: "Isn't it Utterly Human?". I give this film: Five Stars- An absolutely, emphatically, perfect ten flick!

    Girl loves boy. Boy ignores girl. Girl returns home. Boy lusts over girl. You get the picture. It may sound unoriginal, but there's a little darkness floating throughout Sabrina that makes it gripping. Not every love story starts with a suicide attempt. Nor does the girl become attracted to the more sensible, if less fun, of two brothers. Sabrina is a comedy that deals with social class, but not in a patronizing way. She isn't the poor little flower generously allowed into the family. She's a hardworking girl and the men realise how lucky they are. Bogart is slightly miscast (mostly due to his age), but the trio of him, Hepburn, and Holden is miraculous, despite rumors of offscreen tension. Holden is charming, and comes across as a lusty younger man, rather than the complete sleaze many could perceive him as. Bogart is logical, smart, with a slight cruel sense of humor. It amounts to a brotherly relationship full of love, but also a bit of rivalry and hate. The film works by removing any antagonist, and making love the antagonist itself. This means we are watching people wrestle for attention and admiration and, as the audience, we generally want people to make the right choices and be happy. Another great Hepburn classic.

    This movie is mostly for Hepburn fans, less so for Wilder acolytes, and has little if anything for Bogieists or Holdenites. Wilder is milder here than anywhere else (except maybe his other Audrey, Love in the Afternoon), leaving a little wit and cynicism scattered about to remind viewers who sat next to the camera. Bogie is uninvolved and uninvolving, reads his lines dutifully, and has NO chemistry with Hepburn. The only advantage of his casting (as opposed to Grant) is that the romance isn't a foregone conclusion--Bogie's romantic days were behind him. And shoulda stayed there. Holden is 10 years and several previous Wilders too old for his carefree playboy--the bad bleach job just makes him look older. At least he and AH have some on-screen chemistry (and a lot more off-screen). Not much of a comedy, all in all, and no romance. Audrey carries it, and carries it off, both with ease

    In terms of the plot and story, the movie is good, it develops slowly and while often things appear to be strange, they do make sense at the end. Light entertaining movie, Audry Hepburn, anyone will fall in love with her! I am rating it 4, because the movie seemed to be ordinary, and just found the ending sick. Please don't read from here, if don't want to know the climax. Just because, someone is rich, caring, doesn't mean he can become a husband. He's fatherly for her. His demeanor, personality, and shrewdness is often cheap and while looking at the role of 22-years old Audry Hepburn, he doesn't seem to be suitable for her. On this count, the movie did disappointed and left a bitter feeling at the end. Even if they could have shown it, her leaving David (and Linus too), that would have appeared more graceful. It would have portrayed the feelings of female pride, independence, yet tender nature.

    SABRINA I thought it was not a bad movie. It is the kind of movie that is nice to put on on a wet Sunday afternoon. I only recorded this movie from the TV because it has Audrey Hepburn in it. She was a great actress. I have not seen many of her movies, but I intend to watch more. Sabrina is played by Audrey. She is a chauffeur's daughter who has loved the son of her fathers rich employer since she was a little girl. The only problem, he looks right past her and takes no notice of her, until... she leaves for Paris to get over him. But when she comes back 2 years later... he is smitten. But so is his brother. I thought the story was quite good and the acting was good also. But then it should have. It had some big names from it's time. Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart & William Holden. Like I said... this movie is good for a wet weekend... but it is not really a film I could watch over and over. I will probably watch this again in a few years when I have forgotten it. For Audrey... out of the 3 films I have seen of hers so far... this is the worst. But it is still good. I will give this film a 6 out of 10. Roman Holiday for me is still her best.

    Long Island is the place where the wealthy Larabees live. The family consists of four people, father and mother and two sons, David and Linus. They have anything you can imagine at their mansion, big rooms, sports grounds, luxurious cars, and so on. Life there is like life in paradise. They have a chauffeur called Fairchild who has a shy, awkward, very young daughter called Sabrina. Sabrina has been in love with David, the younger boy, all her life. David is a playboy who has been married three times and divorced every time. She is afraid of telling him about her feelings towards him. She is supposed to be sent to Paris to learn how to cook. The night before her journey to Paris, she sees David dancing with a girl and decides to commit suicide, but Linus stops her. On her journey to Paris, she learns how to live and love instead of learning how to cook, and she decides to take part in life instead of watching it. So she comes back as a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. David, who hardly noticed her existence at Long Island falls in love with her. Naturally his family objects to this relationship and Linus, David's brother, plans something to get rid of this situation. He tries to make her fall in love with him himself, and they really fall in love. Sabrina who has been in pain and agony of David's love all her life finally finds a cure, but she has to deal with the cure now. It seems the cure for a love is another love, so love is incurable and inevitable. As she says herself " I don't want to run away from life any more." David finds out about her and his brother. Then he, who knows much more about love than his bother who has been working on business all his life and never felt such feelings, decides to help them get to each other. Finally Sabrina goes back to Paris, where she found how to love, with her love.

    "Sabrina" (1954) and "Roman Holiday" (1953) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    When I watch this film, I'm a little sad that Humphrey Bogart spent so much of his career -- particularly in the 1930s -- on rather shallow thug roles. The forties were his heyday with a number of outstanding parts, and in the 1950s there were a few particularly impressive films -- "The Caine Mutiny" and "The African Queen"...both favorites of mine. But perhaps I enjoy Bogart even more in this film because he is cast against type -- it's a rather gentle, light comedy/drama role. And he is so very good here! I also tend to think that one of the reasons he fit so nicely in this role was that in his youth he was somewhat privileged, his family living in New York's fashionable Upper West Side, and summering at a 55 acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in New York State -- just 12 miles from my home town. This is one of a handful of films (including those previously mentioned, along with "Casablanca") that if not made with Bogart would have made his filmography weaker. But this film also belongs to Audrey Hepburn...one of her earliest major roles. And, she shines it it...particularly in terms of at the beginning of the film playing a girl who then grows up and becomes very sophisticated while in Paris. A wonderful, wonderful role...and I say that as not a particular fan of Hepburn. And then there's William Holden, who comes off third in this film, though he does so pleasantly. He's very likable here, although he had many other films that were much stronger for hi. The supporting cast is excellent, as well. Worth noting are character actors Walter Hampden and John Williams. They add much to the production. I rarely give an "8", but here I will. This is a gem, and it's definitely on my DVD shelf!

    There are a lot of great reviews posted about this movie -- Don't trust them. I am a big fan of Audrey Hepburn, and a fan of Bogart and Billy Wilder.. Sabrina does none of them justice. In Sabrina (played by Audrey Hepburn) the title character has the emotional maturity of a 13 year old girl. That's okay in a sense, because films are about growing as a person.. but her character only ever grows in superficial ways, entirely subject to the whims of circumstance. No one in this film really knows what they want. The characters are all extremely weak. There are only about 3 or 4 lines where Bogart sounds like himself. It's kind of slow and a little boring. Honestly I only finished watching this movie because I know that Billy Wilder can deliver, and I'm glad I finished it. The ending was good, but overall this movie was definitely below average. There are many films out there I've found to be a lot more satisfying. Charade, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 7 year itch were all better.

    What an incredible cast for this movie! You have Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, AND Bill Holden?? How could this not be a wonderful film? So much better than "Sabrina" with Harrison Ford back in the 90's. This was, and always will be the original. And it is. If you like classic romantic comedy, or you love Audrey Hepburn, you will certainly enjoy this one. It is not an overly subtle movie, and the characters sometimes change their whole outlook quite suddenly, but this is fairly common of the genre, and is not a particular flaw of this movie. If you are more interested in classics or Audrey Hepburn than romantic comedy, then you probably won't like the 1995 remake. If, however, you enjoy romantic comedy in general, and are willing to accept that they are not the same movie, I believe you may enjoy the remake even more than the original. I did, and I adore Audrey Hepburn.

    The scenario is set up whereby a well to do Long Island Family, with all the social register trappings of success and prominence, wind up purporting their New York societal clout through lavish parties! These parties exude a facade of pecuniary omnipotence from the benevolent aristocracy, via the Larabee family. Amidst all the accoutrement of the wealthy Larabee household, are a chauffeur and his daughter who live above the garage of this domicile which houses eight beautiful cars. Now what? The daughter (Audrey Hepburn) develops a precocious crush on one of the Larabees, David (William Holden). All of this is very natural for a susceptible, barely out of adolescence, emotionally distraught female. She is fixated on a young, good looking, devil may care bachelor of a plutocratic offspring. The initial dilemma for Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is that David does not really even notice her, however, after she spends two years in Paris, she returns, and, David becomes seriously intrigued with the woman, Sabrina, as opposed to the girl, Sabrina, he knew a couple of years back, whom he never paid attention to. Therefore, Sabrina's love interest of idealism with David has resonated to fruition, thus making Sabrina's childhood heart throb,her potentially significant other.. "Isn't it Romantic?" (Just like the song which was ubiquitously playing throughout the film). So, what's the glitch to this entire panacea? Meet the brother.. Linus,(Humphrey Bogart), and now, for Sabrina, it becomes a proverbial instance of choosing between impetuous passion vs debenture bonds. At first, the fiscally responsible brother, who is running the Larabee empire, Linus Larabee, (Humphrey Bogart) escorts Sabrina around, only in a perfunctory capacity as a result of David's hapless absence.

But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    When I watch this film, I'm a little sad that Humphrey Bogart spent so much of his career -- particularly in the 1930s -- on rather shallow thug roles. The forties were his heyday with a number of outstanding parts, and in the 1950s there were a few particularly impressive films -- "The Caine Mutiny" and "The African Queen"...both favorites of mine. But perhaps I enjoy Bogart even more in this film because he is cast against type -- it's a rather gentle, light comedy/drama role. And he is so very good here! I also tend to think that one of the reasons he fit so nicely in this role was that in his youth he was somewhat privileged, his family living in New York's fashionable Upper West Side, and summering at a 55 acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in New York State -- just 12 miles from my home town. This is one of a handful of films (including those previously mentioned, along with "Casablanca") that if not made with Bogart would have made his filmography weaker. But this film also belongs to Audrey Hepburn...one of her earliest major roles. And, she shines it it...particularly in terms of at the beginning of the film playing a girl who then grows up and becomes very sophisticated while in Paris. A wonderful, wonderful role...and I say that as not a particular fan of Hepburn. And then there's William Holden, who comes off third in this film, though he does so pleasantly. He's very likable here, although he had many other films that were much stronger for hi. The supporting cast is excellent, as well. Worth noting are character actors Walter Hampden and John Williams. They add much to the production. I rarely give an "8", but here I will. This is a gem, and it's definitely on my DVD shelf!

    There are a lot of great reviews posted about this movie -- Don't trust them. I am a big fan of Audrey Hepburn, and a fan of Bogart and Billy Wilder.. Sabrina does none of them justice. In Sabrina (played by Audrey Hepburn) the title character has the emotional maturity of a 13 year old girl. That's okay in a sense, because films are about growing as a person.. but her character only ever grows in superficial ways, entirely subject to the whims of circumstance. No one in this film really knows what they want. The characters are all extremely weak. There are only about 3 or 4 lines where Bogart sounds like himself. It's kind of slow and a little boring. Honestly I only finished watching this movie because I know that Billy Wilder can deliver, and I'm glad I finished it. The ending was good, but overall this movie was definitely below average. There are many films out there I've found to be a lot more satisfying. Charade, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 7 year itch were all better.

    What an incredible cast for this movie! You have Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, AND Bill Holden?? How could this not be a wonderful film? So much better than "Sabrina" with Harrison Ford back in the 90's. This was, and always will be the original. And it is. If you like classic romantic comedy, or you love Audrey Hepburn, you will certainly enjoy this one. It is not an overly subtle movie, and the characters sometimes change their whole outlook quite suddenly, but this is fairly common of the genre, and is not a particular flaw of this movie. If you are more interested in classics or Audrey Hepburn than romantic comedy, then you probably won't like the 1995 remake. If, however, you enjoy romantic comedy in general, and are willing to accept that they are not the same movie, I believe you may enjoy the remake even more than the original. I did, and I adore Audrey Hepburn.

    The scenario is set up whereby a well to do Long Island Family, with all the social register trappings of success and prominence, wind up purporting their New York societal clout through lavish parties! These parties exude a facade of pecuniary omnipotence from the benevolent aristocracy, via the Larabee family. Amidst all the accoutrement of the wealthy Larabee household, are a chauffeur and his daughter who live above the garage of this domicile which houses eight beautiful cars. Now what? The daughter (Audrey Hepburn) develops a precocious crush on one of the Larabees, David (William Holden). All of this is very natural for a susceptible, barely out of adolescence, emotionally distraught female. She is fixated on a young, good looking, devil may care bachelor of a plutocratic offspring. The initial dilemma for Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is that David does not really even notice her, however, after she spends two years in Paris, she returns, and, David becomes seriously intrigued with the woman, Sabrina, as opposed to the girl, Sabrina, he knew a couple of years back, whom he never paid attention to. Therefore, Sabrina's love interest of idealism with David has resonated to fruition, thus making Sabrina's childhood heart throb,her potentially significant other.. "Isn't it Romantic?" (Just like the song which was ubiquitously playing throughout the film). So, what's the glitch to this entire panacea? Meet the brother.. Linus,(Humphrey Bogart), and now, for Sabrina, it becomes a proverbial instance of choosing between impetuous passion vs debenture bonds. At first, the fiscally responsible brother, who is running the Larabee empire, Linus Larabee, (Humphrey Bogart) escorts Sabrina around, only in a perfunctory capacity as a result of David's hapless absence. Invariably, a relationship manifests itself between Linus and Sabrina, (Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart), however, it does not involve hanky-panky, it merely entails a largess of candid conversation: The gist of these conversations being along the line of " You saved me from being ravaged by carbon monoxide": "All I can think about is the plastics' merger": "I can make a souffl&eacute; out of oyster crackers": "What's French for where's my sister's yellow pencil?": "Paris is the city for lovers, that's why I spent only 35 minutes there"; and finally, "If you caught in the rain in Paris, leave your hat and umbrella at home". Sabrina is afflicted by an impressionable infatuation, for David, and for Paris, however, the acutely insightful reality pertaining to the relationship she has with Linus, (Humphrey Bogart) ultimately puts infatuation in its proper perspective. Romance games lose out to the auspicious necessity of cultivating a simple human understanding of one another. Such a characteristic is an indelible element in human behavior which establishes the ultimate foundation for true love! This film, "Sabrina", contains a wealth of talent both on and off the screen. It stars: Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and Wiliam Holden. Writers and directors are listed as follows: Samuel Taylor (Writer of the stage play, "Sabrina") Ernest Lehman (Known for works such as; "North By Northwest", "The Sweet Smell of Success" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") and last ,and most importantly: Billy Wilder (Known for a bevy of classics, including "Sunset Boulevard" and "Double Indemnity"). This film is a fabulously witty romantic comedy! The remake with Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear was testament to the fact that "Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery". When it comes to the precarious remora of relationships, many encompassing aspects include; money, intense lovemaking, and dangerously idealistic cavorting.. "Isn't it Romantic?", Yet, when it comes to truly being in love: "Isn't it Utterly Human?". I give this film: Five Stars- An absolutely, emphatically, perfect ten flick!

    Girl loves boy. Boy ignores girl. Girl returns home. Boy lusts over girl. You get the picture. It may sound unoriginal, but there's a little darkness floating throughout Sabrina that makes it gripping. Not every love story starts with a suicide attempt. Nor does the girl become attracted to the more sensible, if less fun, of two brothers. Sabrina is a comedy that deals with social class, but not in a patronizing way. She isn't the poor little flower generously allowed into the family. She's a hardworking girl and the men realise how lucky they are. Bogart is slightly miscast (mostly due to his age), but the trio of him, Hepburn, and Holden is miraculous, despite rumors of offscreen tension. Holden is charming, and comes across as a lusty younger man, rather than the complete sleaze many could perceive him as. Bogart is logical, smart, with a slight cruel sense of humor. It amounts to a brotherly relationship full of love, but also a bit of rivalry and hate. The film works by removing any antagonist, and making love the antagonist itself. This means we are watching people wrestle for attention and admiration and, as the audience, we generally want people to make the right choices and be happy. Another great Hepburn classic.

    This movie is mostly for Hepburn fans, less so for Wilder acolytes, and has little if anything for Bogieists or Holdenites. Wilder is milder here than anywhere else (except maybe his other Audrey, Love in the Afternoon), leaving a little wit and cynicism scattered about to remind viewers who sat next to the camera. Bogie is uninvolved and uninvolving, reads his lines dutifully, and has NO chemistry with Hepburn. The only advantage of his casting (as opposed to Grant) is that the romance isn't a foregone conclusion--Bogie's romantic days were behind him. And shoulda stayed there. Holden is 10 years and several previous Wilders too old for his carefree playboy--the bad bleach job just makes him look older. At least he and AH have some on-screen chemistry (and a lot more off-screen). Not much of a comedy, all in all, and no romance. Audrey carries it, and carries it off, both with ease

    In terms of the plot and story, the movie is good, it develops slowly and while often things appear to be strange, they do make sense at the end. Light entertaining movie, Audry Hepburn, anyone will fall in love with her! I am rating it 4, because the movie seemed to be ordinary, and just found the ending sick. Please don't read from here, if don't want to know the climax. Just because, someone is rich, caring, doesn't mean he can become a husband. He's fatherly for her. His demeanor, personality, and shrewdness is often cheap and while looking at the role of 22-years old Audry Hepburn, he doesn't seem to be suitable for her. On this count, the movie did disappointed and left a bitter feeling at the end. Even if they could have shown it, her leaving David (and Linus too), that would have appeared more graceful. It would have portrayed the feelings of female pride, independence, yet tender nature.

    SABRINA I thought it was not a bad movie. It is the kind of movie that is nice to put on on a wet Sunday afternoon. I only recorded this movie from the TV because it has Audrey Hepburn in it. She was a great actress. I have not seen many of her movies, but I intend to watch more. Sabrina is played by Audrey. She is a chauffeur's daughter who has loved the son of her fathers rich employer since she was a little girl. The only problem, he looks right past her and takes no notice of her, until... she leaves for Paris to get over him. But when she comes back 2 years later... he is smitten. But so is his brother. I thought the story was quite good and the acting was good also. But then it should have. It had some big names from it's time. Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart & William Holden. Like I said... this movie is good for a wet weekend... but it is not really a film I could watch over and over. I will probably watch this again in a few years when I have forgotten it. For Audrey... out of the 3 films I have seen of hers so far... this is the worst. But it is still good. I will give this film a 6 out of 10. Roman Holiday for me is still her best.

    Long Island is the place where the wealthy Larabees live. The family consists of four people, father and mother and two sons, David and Linus. They have anything you can imagine at their mansion, big rooms, sports grounds, luxurious cars, and so on. Life there is like life in paradise. They have a chauffeur called Fairchild who has a shy, awkward, very young daughter called Sabrina. Sabrina has been in love with David, the younger boy, all her life. David is a playboy who has been married three times and divorced every time. She is afraid of telling him about her feelings towards him. She is supposed to be sent to Paris to learn how to cook. The night before her journey to Paris, she sees David dancing with a girl and decides to commit suicide, but Linus stops her. On her journey to Paris, she learns how to live and love instead of learning how to cook, and she decides to take part in life instead of watching it. So she comes back as a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. David, who hardly noticed her existence at Long Island falls in love with her. Naturally his family objects to this relationship and Linus, David's brother, plans something to get rid of this situation. He tries to make her fall in love with him himself, and they really fall in love. Sabrina who has been in pain and agony of David's love all her life finally finds a cure, but she has to deal with the cure now. It seems the cure for a love is another love, so love is incurable and inevitable. As she says herself " I don't want to run away from life any more." David finds out about her and his brother. Then he, who knows much more about love than his bother who has been working on business all his life and never felt such feelings, decides to help them get to each other. Finally Sabrina goes back to Paris, where she found how to love, with her love.

    "Sabrina" (1954) and "Roman Holiday" (1953) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

Light entertaining movie, Audry Hepburn, anyone will fall in love with her! I am rating it 4, because the movie seemed to be ordinary, and just found the ending sick. Please don't read from here, if don't want to know the climax. Just because, someone is rich, caring, doesn't mean he can become a husband. He's fatherly for her. His demeanor, personality, and shrewdness is often cheap and while looking at the role of 22-years old Audry Hepburn, he doesn't seem to be suitable for her. On this count, the movie did disappointed and left a bitter feeling at the end. Even if they could have shown it, her leaving David (and Linus too), that would have appeared more graceful. It would have portrayed the feelings of female pride, independence, yet tender nature.

    SABRINA I thought it was not a bad movie. It is the kind of movie that is nice to put on on a wet Sunday afternoon. I only recorded this movie from the TV because it has Audrey Hepburn in it. She was a great actress. I have not seen many of her movies, but I intend to watch more. Sabrina is played by Audrey. She is a chauffeur's daughter who has loved the son of her fathers rich employer since she was a little girl. The only problem, he looks right past her and takes no notice of her, until... she leaves for Paris to get over him. But when she comes back 2 years later... he is smitten. But so is his brother. I thought the story was quite good and the acting was good also. But then it should have. It had some big names from it's time. Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart & William Holden. Like I said... this movie is good for a wet weekend... but it is not really a film I could watch over and over. I will probably watch this again in a few years when I have forgotten it. For Audrey... out of the 3 films I have seen of hers so far... this is the worst. But it is still good. I will give this film a 6 out of 10. Roman Holiday for me is still her best.

    Long Island is the place where the wealthy Larabees live. The family consists of four people, father and mother and two sons, David and Linus. They have anything you can imagine at their mansion, big rooms, sports grounds, luxurious cars, and so on. Life there is like life in paradise. They have a chauffeur called Fairchild who has a shy, awkward, very young daughter called Sabrina. Sabrina has been in love with David, the younger boy, all her life. David is a playboy who has been married three times and divorced every time. She is afraid of telling him about her feelings towards him. She is supposed to be sent to Paris to learn how to cook. The night before her journey to Paris, she sees David dancing with a girl and decides to commit suicide, but Linus stops her. On her journey to Paris, she learns how to live and love instead of learning how to cook, and she decides to take part in life instead of watching it. So she comes back as a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. David, who hardly noticed her existence at Long Island falls in love with her. Naturally his family objects to this relationship and Linus, David's brother, plans something to get rid of this situation. He tries to make her fall in love with him himself, and they really fall in love. Sabrina who has been in pain and agony of David's love all her life finally finds a cure, but she has to deal with the cure now. It seems the cure for a love is another love, so love is incurable and inevitable. As she says herself " I don't want to run away from life any more." David finds out about her and his brother. Then he, who knows much more about love than his bother who has been working on business all his life and never felt such feelings, decides to help them get to each other. Finally Sabrina goes back to Paris, where she found how to love, with her love.

    "Sabrina" (1954) and "Roman Holiday" (1953) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    When I watch this film, I'm a little sad that Humphrey Bogart spent so much of his career -- particularly in the 1930s -- on rather shallow thug roles. The forties were his heyday with a number of outstanding parts, and in the 1950s there were a few particularly impressive films -- "The Caine Mutiny" and "The African Queen"...both favorites of mine. But perhaps I enjoy Bogart even more in this film because he is cast against type -- it's a rather gentle, light comedy/drama role. And he is so very good here! I also tend to think that one of the reasons he fit so nicely in this role was that in his youth he was somewhat privileged, his family living in New York's fashionable Upper West Side, and summering at a 55 acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in New York State -- just 12 miles from my home town. This is one of a handful of films (including those previously mentioned, along with "Casablanca") that if not made with Bogart would have made his filmography weaker. But this film also belongs to Audrey Hepburn...one of her earliest major roles. And, she shines it it...particularly in terms of at the beginning of the film playing a girl who then grows up and becomes very sophisticated while in Paris. A wonderful, wonderful role...and I say that as not a particular fan of Hepburn. And then there's William Holden, who comes off third in this film, though he does so pleasantly. He's very likable here, although he had many other films that were much stronger for hi. The supporting cast is excellent, as well. Worth noting are character actors Walter Hampden and John Williams. They add much to the production. I rarely give an "8", but here I will. This is a gem, and it's definitely on my DVD shelf!

    There are a lot of great reviews posted about this movie -- Don't trust them. I am a big fan of Audrey Hepburn, and a fan of Bogart and Billy Wilder.. Sabrina does none of them justice. In Sabrina (played by Audrey Hepburn) the title character has the emotional maturity of a 13 year old girl. That's okay in a sense, because films are about growing as a person.. but her character only ever grows in superficial ways, entirely subject to the whims of circumstance. No one in this film really knows what they want. The characters are all extremely weak. There are only about 3 or 4 lines where Bogart sounds like himself. It's kind of slow and a little boring. Honestly I only finished watching this movie because I know that Billy Wilder can deliver, and I'm glad I finished it. The ending was good, but overall this movie was definitely below average. There are many films out there I've found to be a lot more satisfying. Charade, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 7 year itch were all better.

    What an incredible cast for this movie! You have Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, AND Bill Holden?? How could this not be a wonderful film? So much better than "Sabrina" with Harrison Ford back in the 90's. This was, and always will be the original. And it is. If you like classic romantic comedy, or you love Audrey Hepburn, you will certainly enjoy this one. It is not an overly subtle movie, and the characters sometimes change their whole outlook quite suddenly, but this is fairly common of the genre, and is not a particular flaw of this movie. If you are more interested in classics or Audrey Hepburn than romantic comedy, then you probably won't like the 1995 remake. If, however, you enjoy romantic comedy in general, and are willing to accept that they are not the same movie, I believe you may enjoy the remake even more than the original. I did, and I adore Audrey Hepburn.

    The scenario is set up whereby a well to do Long Island Family, with all the social register trappings of success and prominence, wind up purporting their New York societal clout through lavish parties! These parties exude a facade of pecuniary omnipotence from the benevolent aristocracy, via the Larabee family. Amidst all the accoutrement of the wealthy Larabee household, are a chauffeur and his daughter who live above the garage of this domicile which houses eight beautiful cars. Now what? The daughter (Audrey Hepburn) develops a precocious crush on one of the Larabees, David (William Holden). All of this is very natural for a susceptible, barely out of adolescence, emotionally distraught female. She is fixated on a young, good looking, devil may care bachelor of a plutocratic offspring. The initial dilemma for Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is that David does not really even notice her, however, after she spends two years in Paris, she returns, and, David becomes seriously intrigued with the woman, Sabrina, as opposed to the girl, Sabrina, he knew a couple of years back, whom he never paid attention to. Therefore, Sabrina's love interest of idealism with David has resonated to fruition, thus making Sabrina's childhood heart throb,her potentially significant other.. "Isn't it Romantic?" (Just like the song which was ubiquitously playing throughout the film). So, what's the glitch to this entire panacea? Meet the brother.. Linus,(Humphrey Bogart), and now, for Sabrina, it becomes a proverbial instance of choosing between impetuous passion vs debenture bonds. At first, the fiscally responsible brother, who is running the Larabee empire, Linus Larabee, (Humphrey Bogart) escorts Sabrina around, only in a perfunctory capacity as a result of David's hapless absence. Invariably, a relationship manifests itself between Linus and Sabrina, (Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart), however, it does not involve hanky-panky, it merely entails a largess of candid conversation: The gist of these conversations being along the line of " You saved me from being ravaged by carbon monoxide": "All I can think about is the plastics' merger": "I can make a souffl&eacute; out of oyster crackers": "What's French for where's my sister's yellow pencil?": "Paris is the city for lovers, that's why I spent only 35 minutes there"; and finally, "If you caught in the rain in Paris, leave your hat and umbrella at home". Sabrina is afflicted by an impressionable infatuation, for David, and for Paris, however, the acutely insightful reality pertaining to the relationship she has with Linus, (Humphrey Bogart) ultimately puts infatuation in its proper perspective. Romance games lose out to the auspicious necessity of cultivating a simple human understanding of one another. Such a characteristic is an indelible element in human behavior which establishes the ultimate foundation for true love! This film, "Sabrina", contains a wealth of talent both on and off the screen. It stars: Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and Wiliam Holden. Writers and directors are listed as follows: Samuel Taylor (Writer of the stage play, "Sabrina") Ernest Lehman (Known for works such as; "North By Northwest", "The Sweet Smell of Success" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") and last ,and most importantly: Billy Wilder (Known for a bevy of classics, including "Sunset Boulevard" and "Double Indemnity"). This film is a fabulously witty romantic comedy! The remake with Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear was testament to the fact that "Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery". When it comes to the precarious remora of relationships, many encompassing aspects include; money, intense lovemaking, and dangerously idealistic cavorting.. "Isn't it Romantic?", Yet, when it comes to truly being in love: "Isn't it Utterly Human?". I give this film: Five Stars- An absolutely, emphatically, perfect ten flick!

    Girl loves boy. Boy ignores girl. Girl returns home. Boy lusts over girl. You get the picture. It may sound unoriginal, but there's a little darkness floating throughout Sabrina that makes it gripping. Not every love story starts with a suicide attempt. Nor does the girl become attracted to the more sensible, if less fun, of two brothers. Sabrina is a comedy that deals with social class, but not in a patronizing way. She isn't the poor little flower generously allowed into the family. She's a hardworking girl and the men realise how lucky they are. Bogart is slightly miscast (mostly due to his age), but the trio of him, Hepburn, and Holden is miraculous, despite rumors of offscreen tension. Holden is charming, and comes across as a lusty younger man, rather than the complete sleaze many could perceive him as. Bogart is logical, smart, with a slight cruel sense of humor. It amounts to a brotherly relationship full of love, but also a bit of rivalry and hate. The film works by removing any antagonist, and making love the antagonist itself. This means we are watching people wrestle for attention and admiration and, as the audience, we generally want people to make the right choices and be happy. Another great Hepburn classic.

    This movie is mostly for Hepburn fans, less so for Wilder acolytes, and has little if anything for Bogieists or Holdenites. Wilder is milder here than anywhere else (except maybe his other Audrey, Love in the Afternoon), leaving a little wit and cynicism scattered about to remind viewers who sat next to the camera. Bogie is uninvolved and uninvolving, reads his lines dutifully, and has NO chemistry with Hepburn. The only advantage of his casting (as opposed to Grant) is that the romance isn't a foregone conclusion--Bogie's romantic days were behind him. And shoulda stayed there. Holden is 10 years and several previous Wilders too old for his carefree playboy--the bad bleach job just makes him look older. At least he and AH have some on-screen chemistry (and a lot more off-screen). Not much of a comedy, all in all, and no romance. Audrey carries it, and carries it off, both with ease

    The scenario is set up whereby a well to do Long Island Family, with all the social register trappings of success and prominence, wind up purporting their New York societal clout through lavish parties! These parties exude a facade of pecuniary omnipotence from the benevolent aristocracy, via the Larabee family. Amidst all the accoutrement of the wealthy Larabee household, are a chauffeur and his daughter who live above the garage of this domicile which houses eight beautiful cars. Now what? The daughter (Audrey Hepburn) develops a precocious crush on one of the Larabees, David (William Holden). All of this is very natural for a susceptible, barely out of adolescence, emotionally distraught female. She is fixated on a young, good looking, devil may care bachelor of a plutocratic offspring. The initial dilemma for Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is that David does not really even notice her, however, after she spends two years in Paris, she returns, and, David becomes seriously intrigued with the woman, Sabrina, as opposed to the girl, Sabrina, he knew a couple of years back, whom he never paid attention to. Therefore, Sabrina's love interest of idealism with David has resonated to fruition, thus making Sabrina's childhood heart throb,her potentially significant other.. "Isn't it Romantic?" (Just like the song which was ubiquitously playing throughout the film). So, what's the glitch to this entire panacea? Meet the brother.. Linus,(Humphrey Bogart), and now, for Sabrina, it becomes a proverbial instance of choosing between impetuous passion vs debenture bonds. At first, the fiscally responsible brother, who is running the Larabee empire, Linus Larabee, (Humphrey Bogart) escorts Sabrina around, only in a perfunctory capacity as a result of David's hapless absence. Invariably, a relationship manifests itself between Linus and Sabrina, (Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart), however, it does not involve hanky-panky, it merely entails a largess of candid conversation: The gist of these conversations being along the line of " You saved me from being ravaged by carbon monoxide": "All I can think about is the plastics' merger": "I can make a souffl&eacute; out of oyster crackers": "What's French for where's my sister's yellow pencil?": "Paris is the city for lovers, that's why I spent only 35 minutes there"; and finally, "If you caught in the rain in Paris, leave your hat and umbrella at home". Sabrina is afflicted by an impressionable infatuation, for David, and for Paris, however, the acutely insightful reality pertaining to the relationship she has with Linus, (Humphrey Bogart) ultimately puts infatuation in its proper perspective. Romance games lose out to the auspicious necessity of cultivating a simple human understanding of one another. Such a characteristic is an indelible element in human behavior which establishes the ultimate foundation for true love! This film, "Sabrina", contains a wealth of talent both on and off the screen. It stars: Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and Wiliam Holden. Writers and directors are listed as follows: Samuel Taylor (Writer of the stage play, "Sabrina") Ernest Lehman (Known for works such as; "North By Northwest", "The Sweet Smell of Success" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") and last ,and most importantly: Billy Wilder (Known for a bevy of classics, including "Sunset Boulevard" and "Double Indemnity"). This film is a fabulously witty romantic comedy! The remake with Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear was testament to the fact that "Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery". When it comes to the precarious remora of relationships, many encompassing aspects include; money, intense lovemaking, and dangerously idealistic cavorting.. "Isn't it Romantic?", Yet, when it comes to truly being in love: "Isn't it Utterly Human?". I give this film: Five Stars- An absolutely, emphatically, perfect ten flick!

    Girl loves boy. Boy ignores girl. Girl returns home. Boy lusts over girl. You get the picture. It may sound unoriginal, but there's a little darkness floating throughout Sabrina that makes it gripping. Not every love story starts with a suicide attempt. Nor does the girl become attracted to the more sensible, if less fun, of two brothers. Sabrina is a comedy that deals with social class, but not in a patronizing way. She isn't the poor little flower generously allowed into the family. She's a hardworking girl and the men realise how lucky they are. Bogart is slightly miscast (mostly due to his age), but the trio of him, Hepburn, and Holden is miraculous, despite rumors of offscreen tension. Holden is charming, and comes across as a lusty younger man, rather than the complete sleaze many could perceive him as. Bogart is logical, smart, with a slight cruel sense of humor. It amounts to a brotherly relationship full of love, but also a bit of rivalry and hate. The film works by removing any antagonist, and making love the antagonist itself. This means we are watching people wrestle for attention and admiration and, as the audience, we generally want people to make the right choices and be happy. Another great Hepburn classic.
