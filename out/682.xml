    (Plot) Four good looking teens commit inadvertent manslaughter after a night of celebrating, and there lives change forever one year later after people start turning up dead. I enjoy this film a lot for what it is. There I said it. I'm not ashamed to admit it to you either. After Scream came out and redefined the genre, many crappy slashers followed in pursuit to try and replicate it. It did have a few that were fun, and this badboy is one of them. This movie is very, very slick. The killer himself isn't all that imposing. A man with a hoodie and a hook just doesn't cut it for me. They really should have picked a killer that looked menacing. The stalk sequences make up for it though. They are consummate and highly suspenseful. The lengthy stalk sequence between The Fisherman & Helen (Gellar) was something else. It was stylish and had me on the edge of my seat like I was waiting for Jennifer Love Hewitt to arrive to be my date. Speaking of JLH. The woman is serious scream queen material. I don't know if it was fear of typecasting or what, but she hasn't done a whole lot of horror since these movies. Granted, the sequel is atrocious, but I felt she was very solid here. She was likable, and screamed like a champ. She had the acting chops, the looks, and everything else. I loved how vulnerable her character became and how leery she was due to guilt. She pulled it off perfectly. Freddie Prinze Jr. is another story. Man, was he awful. Has he ever heard of acting classes? He should really take one. He was pretty bad to say the least. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a hottie, and likable to boot. She's involved in one of my favorite scenes in this film "the hair cutting" scene. Ryan Phillippe plays a great jock. His character was a real jerk, and he excelled at it, but I couldn't help but like him. Bridgette Wilson plays snotty to a T. Not much more to it than that. My only real complaints are is that Anne Heche's role is completely disposable. What was the point of her in this movie again? I also thought the ending was way too cheesy. It's like they were pressured to give the people a quick jolt at the end, and to setup the sequel. I deem it completely unnecessary. Final Thoughts: I'm probably gonna get a lot of dirty looks after people read this review, but oh, well. I like it a lot and that's all there is to it. For an era of crappy slashers, this is one I can always go back to and have a blast. If you haven't seen it, to quote Jennifer Love Hewitt in this film "WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??" 6.3/10

    Yay! A horror movie that is actually a little scary! I only watched this because Johnny Galecki was from "Roseanne", and Sarah Michelle Gellar. But it was really good! Great acting. Now, whenever I see Jennifer Love Hewitt on a commercial or something, I think, "Hey! It's that girl from 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'!" This movie is very original and a good adaptation of a book, one of the best. Great movie and not a bad sequel. It is, rated R for horror violence and language. Very creepy movie and very suspenseful, and I recommend buying or watching this movie. Very good.

    A lot of people liked this movie when it came out but even when it first came out I thought it was garbage and not even the slighest bit scary and I was about nine years old. The acting was terrible the plot was silly and all over the place. Just not a very good attempt not even worth watching. This movie is about a group of friends while out one night partying, drinking and driving they hit a man. They check on him and assume he is dead so they throw him into the ocean so not to get in trouble by the cops. Even though they were the only ones there but then they start getting harassed by someone saying I know what you did last summer. This movie was not good at all. I will never understand why people justify making a slasher horror movie PG-13 like give me a break give this movie an R and a new cast and it might be something watchable.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer is a horror mystery slasher film based loosely off the book by Lois Duncan of the same name. The film stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr., and features Anne Heche and Bridgette Wilson in supporting roles. The screenplay was written by Kevin Williamson and directed by Jim Gillespie. During the annual July 4th festivities in a North Carolina fishing town, Helen wins a local beauty contest and departs with her boyfriend Barry and pals Julie and Ray. On their way back home, Ray hits a fisherman with her car. The teens panic, drop the body in the water, and abandon the scene. Many months later when Julie returns from college, she gets an anonymous note,"I know what you did last summer." The four teens suspect the note was written by their classmate Max, but then Max is murdered and the terror begins. Teasing and taut, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a teen horror flick with a different kind of kick to it.It is a smart, sharply drawn horror genre film with a moral center and a solid cast which provides a fun, energetic and scary movie.No wonder it was a big hit during the 90's.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHNMkUwKxbI (Modernized Re-Cut Teaser) Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Barry (Ryan Phillipe) are four friends that make a grave mistake when they choose to cover up their hit and run of a town local on the July 4th weekend. One year later, Julie receives an ominous letter that reunites the four friends, however not for long when they realize that secret that they buried, wasn't actually dead... The thing that annoys me the most about this movie has nothing to do with the movie, it's the audience. A 5.5 star rating is a ridiculous for a great suspenseful Slasher flick like this. It easily tops all of the other Scream inspired slashers and is it's own film, without overdosing on movie references. IKWYDLS has a great script written by Kevin Williamson, John Debney's direction is great and the cinematography looks superb. The suspense is built through the magnificent score thanks to Shirley Walker in scenes such as Gellar's chase scene and Love-Hewitt's body in the trunk sequence. The film has an interesting concept that by now you've seen or read a few times, but it is still an interesting concept nonetheless. The film's villain, The Fisherman, creates a great feeling of lurking dread. His on screen appearance is quite menacing, bearing a fisherman's black coat and a deadly slicker. The biggest downfall ultimately of this movie is the casting of the lead roles. Sarah Michelle Gellar undeniably steals the show from Jennifer Love-Hewitt in her role as Helen Shivers, the beauty queen with the shattered dream. Even Ryan Phillipe as Barry Cox who is the arrogant typical rich jock is far superior than Freddie Prinze Jr., who might I add, has a cringe worthy performance. Jennifer plays her character well, but alongside Gellar she really was the lesser character and actor. I'm not saying the two should of switched roles, but a more compelling actor should have been chose for Julie's character, same for the character of Ray who was upstaged by the character the audience was supposed to loathe. The best scene of the film was definitely Helen's chase scene, it was suspenseful, frightening and scary. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and was sad to see the movie's gem bite the dust. It will be a memorable Horror scene for years to come, if only Gellar applied herself to more Horror orientated roles, she'd sure give Jamie Lee Curtis a run for her money. All in all, I believe 30% of this film's audience was disappointed in how unfaithful the movie was to the book. I was able to look past this fact, putting aside the miscasting of roles and was able to accept this movie as the underrated brilliant Slasher flick that it is. 8/10, B+.

    15 years after this movie came out, I watched this movie. Not out of fear, if anything scared me, I was afraid that this would be Dawson's Creek with serial killers and on a personal note that is scarier that ANY horror movie icon could ever be, but I digress, let's get to it. Basic Story Guide (contains a few spoilers) After attending a beauty pageant, Julie James, Helen Shivers, Ray Bronson, and Barry Cox, are driving home after celebrating their last year together. As Barry's drink falls on Ray (who is driving), they all hear a THUD! the sound of a high velocity impact. Upon inspecting the car, and suspecting that it may have been an animal, Julie makes a horrifying discovery: a boot. A few feet away, they find the mutilated remains of a man. After debating on going to the police, the four decide that the best course of action is to dump the man in the river, and NEVER speaking of this again. One year later, Julie receives a message that only contains seven words: "I know what you did last summer." Before I give you the verdict I will say this, I am fan of 90's slashers and 90's horror movies. The Craft, The Faculity, Sleepy Hollow, Urban Legend, Scream even Scary Movie (a parody of 90's slasher movies so I love it), etc. So my opinion of this maybe a little bias but I will give you my honest opinion from how I feel about it. Verdict: Other than a few plot holes and numerous clich&eacute;s, over all it's a solid 90's horror movie. Well acted, and good energy between four main characters. Descent tension but a little weak on scares. And it contains one the best chase scenes. Sarah Michelle Geller sells it well. Overall 7/10

    There's no doubt that writer Kevin Williamson has a talent for this genre. Although he he describes cruel murders much better then he describes characters, that can' t be contested. Williamson is not able to to unravel the story as well as he has done before - and after this movie. It started out well, but was taken down to earth too quickly, director Jim Gillespie it not too known to me, so I can' t really on his abilities. This seems to be the perfect movie for young people who love horror movies. It looks like this particular resipe has became a trend in the last years, just like in the 70s and the 80s. Pretty young people in a horror scenario of dimensions, a mad killer on the loose with his bloody hook. The movie is realtive creepy, and has several hard hitting surprise along the way. There may be too many stereotypes though, and the young cries vigor related to an extreme evil murderer wasn' t especially credible - nor original. But the plot and effects still kept it interesting and tense - so I couldn't expect more from a movie in this genre. Good horror, but the characters were disappointing.

    Do you know what you did last summer? Well Jennifer Love Hewitt (Julie James), Freddie Prinze Jr. (Ray Bronson), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Helen Shivers) and Ryan Phillipe (Barry Cox)remember what they did in the summer of 1997. They played four teenagers who accidentally ran over a man on the road and dumped his body over a cliff into the sea. A year after the accident, Julie receives a note telling her that someone knows their secret from the year before. Soon a murderous fisherman with a hook begins stalking them and murdering those around the four to get to the four teens. The acting in this film is not the greatest that any of the four principals in the film as they are picked off one by one. The plot is based on the young adult novel by Lois Duncan, but there are differences however I can't tell what they are if you have not read the book. The suspense in the film is lacking as you can usually predict when the killer is going to strike or when a body is going to be found. But if you want want to see this movie, then by all means do so.

    Not seen this movie for years and really enjoyed it on my last watch. I found this movie very entertaining and never found it boring, it did not bother me that was no real fun factor that the scream series had but still enjoyed it. I did like some of the kills scenes were decent but nothing compare to past slasher movies like Ghost face as they went not gory or memorable as them however there was some blood moments in the movie. The acting from the well know cast was outstanding and there were one or two tense moment in this movie, which I thought really good and made the killer fish man look bit scary at least. The twist was a little disappointing as you can see coming, I going to give this movie 7 out of 10

    Hewitt, Gellar, Hech, Phillippe, Freddie Prinze Jr., Bridgette Wilson- Sampras, and Johnny Galecki show you how entertaining a great cast can make a decent slasher script. Gellar and Phillippe were so good together, they were reunited two years later in another classic, Cruel Intentions. This film's general concept is cool, and I appreciate the unexpected resolution of some of the scenes, but too many of the other scenes are run-of-the-mill, some of the stunts are hokey, and some of the dialogue is cheesy. Still, I'm a fan of this cast and the hook-man urban legend, so I consider this flick a slasher classic. Your life won't be incomplete if you never see this movie, but it's worth watching if you ever stumble across it. On a final note, if you're trying to get your squeamish girlfriend to watch a horror film with you, this movie is a great set of training wheels. It is one of the mildest slasher flicks I've seen. I'm actually surprised it got an R rating.

There may be too many stereotypes though, and the young cries vigor related to an extreme evil murderer wasn' t especially credible - nor original. But the plot and effects still kept it interesting and tense - so I couldn't expect more from a movie in this genre. Good horror, but the characters were disappointing.

    Do you know what you did last summer? Well Jennifer Love Hewitt (Julie James), Freddie Prinze Jr. (Ray Bronson), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Helen Shivers) and Ryan Phillipe (Barry Cox)remember what they did in the summer of 1997. They played four teenagers who accidentally ran over a man on the road and dumped his body over a cliff into the sea. A year after the accident, Julie receives a note telling her that someone knows their secret from the year before. Soon a murderous fisherman with a hook begins stalking them and murdering those around the four to get to the four teens. The acting in this film is not the greatest that any of the four principals in the film as they are picked off one by one. The plot is based on the young adult novel by Lois Duncan, but there are differences however I can't tell what they are if you have not read the book. The suspense in the film is lacking as you can usually predict when the killer is going to strike or when a body is going to be found. But if you want want to see this movie, then by all means do so.

    Not seen this movie for years and really enjoyed it on my last watch. I found this movie very entertaining and never found it boring, it did not bother me that was no real fun factor that the scream series had but still enjoyed it. I did like some of the kills scenes were decent but nothing compare to past slasher movies like Ghost face as they went not gory or memorable as them however there was some blood moments in the movie. The acting from the well know cast was outstanding and there were one or two tense moment in this movie, which I thought really good and made the killer fish man look bit scary at least. The twist was a little disappointing as you can see coming, I going to give this movie 7 out of 10

    Hewitt, Gellar, Hech, Phillippe, Freddie Prinze Jr., Bridgette Wilson- Sampras, and Johnny Galecki show you how entertaining a great cast can make a decent slasher script. Gellar and Phillippe were so good together, they were reunited two years later in another classic, Cruel Intentions. This film's general concept is cool, and I appreciate the unexpected resolution of some of the scenes, but too many of the other scenes are run-of-the-mill, some of the stunts are hokey, and some of the dialogue is cheesy. Still, I'm a fan of this cast and the hook-man urban legend, so I consider this flick a slasher classic. Your life won't be incomplete if you never see this movie, but it's worth watching if you ever stumble across it. On a final note, if you're trying to get your squeamish girlfriend to watch a horror film with you, this movie is a great set of training wheels. It is one of the mildest slasher flicks I've seen. I'm actually surprised it got an R rating.

    (Plot) Four good looking teens commit inadvertent manslaughter after a night of celebrating, and there lives change forever one year later after people start turning up dead. I enjoy this film a lot for what it is. There I said it. I'm not ashamed to admit it to you either. After Scream came out and redefined the genre, many crappy slashers followed in pursuit to try and replicate it. It did have a few that were fun, and this badboy is one of them. This movie is very, very slick. The killer himself isn't all that imposing. A man with a hoodie and a hook just doesn't cut it for me. They really should have picked a killer that looked menacing. The stalk sequences make up for it though. They are consummate and highly suspenseful. The lengthy stalk sequence between The Fisherman & Helen (Gellar) was something else. It was stylish and had me on the edge of my seat like I was waiting for Jennifer Love Hewitt to arrive to be my date. Speaking of JLH. The woman is serious scream queen material. I don't know if it was fear of typecasting or what, but she hasn't done a whole lot of horror since these movies. Granted, the sequel is atrocious, but I felt she was very solid here. She was likable, and screamed like a champ. She had the acting chops, the looks, and everything else. I loved how vulnerable her character became and how leery she was due to guilt. She pulled it off perfectly. Freddie Prinze Jr. is another story. Man, was he awful. Has he ever heard of acting classes? He should really take one. He was pretty bad to say the least. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a hottie, and likable to boot. She's involved in one of my favorite scenes in this film "the hair cutting" scene. Ryan Phillippe plays a great jock. His character was a real jerk, and he excelled at it, but I couldn't help but like him. Bridgette Wilson plays snotty to a T. Not much more to it than that. My only real complaints are is that Anne Heche's role is completely disposable. What was the point of her in this movie again? I also thought the ending was way too cheesy. It's like they were pressured to give the people a quick jolt at the end, and to setup the sequel. I deem it completely unnecessary. Final Thoughts: I'm probably gonna get a lot of dirty looks after people read this review, but oh, well. I like it a lot and that's all there is to it. For an era of crappy slashers, this is one I can always go back to and have a blast. If you haven't seen it, to quote Jennifer Love Hewitt in this film "WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??" 6.3/10

    Yay! A horror movie that is actually a little scary! I only watched this because Johnny Galecki was from "Roseanne", and Sarah Michelle Gellar. But it was really good! Great acting. Now, whenever I see Jennifer Love Hewitt on a commercial or something, I think, "Hey! It's that girl from 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'!" This movie is very original and a good adaptation of a book, one of the best. Great movie and not a bad sequel. It is, rated R for horror violence and language. Very creepy movie and very suspenseful, and I recommend buying or watching this movie. Very good.

    A lot of people liked this movie when it came out but even when it first came out I thought it was garbage and not even the slighest bit scary and I was about nine years old. The acting was terrible the plot was silly and all over the place. Just not a very good attempt not even worth watching. This movie is about a group of friends while out one night partying, drinking and driving they hit a man. They check on him and assume he is dead so they throw him into the ocean so not to get in trouble by the cops. Even though they were the only ones there but then they start getting harassed by someone saying I know what you did last summer. This movie was not good at all. I will never understand why people justify making a slasher horror movie PG-13 like give me a break give this movie an R and a new cast and it might be something watchable.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer is a horror mystery slasher film based loosely off the book by Lois Duncan of the same name. The film stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr., and features Anne Heche and Bridgette Wilson in supporting roles. The screenplay was written by Kevin Williamson and directed by Jim Gillespie. During the annual July 4th festivities in a North Carolina fishing town, Helen wins a local beauty contest and departs with her boyfriend Barry and pals Julie and Ray. On their way back home, Ray hits a fisherman with her car. The teens panic, drop the body in the water, and abandon the scene. Many months later when Julie returns from college, she gets an anonymous note,"I know what you did last summer." The four teens suspect the note was written by their classmate Max, but then Max is murdered and the terror begins. Teasing and taut, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a teen horror flick with a different kind of kick to it.It is a smart, sharply drawn horror genre film with a moral center and a solid cast which provides a fun, energetic and scary movie.No wonder it was a big hit during the 90's.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHNMkUwKxbI (Modernized Re-Cut Teaser) Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Barry (Ryan Phillipe) are four friends that make a grave mistake when they choose to cover up their hit and run of a town local on the July 4th weekend. One year later, Julie receives an ominous letter that reunites the four friends, however not for long when they realize that secret that they buried, wasn't actually dead... The thing that annoys me the most about this movie has nothing to do with the movie, it's the audience. A 5.5 star rating is a ridiculous for a great suspenseful Slasher flick like this. It easily tops all of the other Scream inspired slashers and is it's own film, without overdosing on movie references. IKWYDLS has a great script written by Kevin Williamson, John Debney's direction is great and the cinematography looks superb. The suspense is built through the magnificent score thanks to Shirley Walker in scenes such as Gellar's chase scene and Love-Hewitt's body in the trunk sequence. The film has an interesting concept that by now you've seen or read a few times, but it is still an interesting concept nonetheless. The film's villain, The Fisherman, creates a great feeling of lurking dread. His on screen appearance is quite menacing, bearing a fisherman's black coat and a deadly slicker. The biggest downfall ultimately of this movie is the casting of the lead roles. Sarah Michelle Gellar undeniably steals the show from Jennifer Love-Hewitt in her role as Helen Shivers, the beauty queen with the shattered dream. Even Ryan Phillipe as Barry Cox who is the arrogant typical rich jock is far superior than Freddie Prinze Jr., who might I add, has a cringe worthy performance. Jennifer plays her character well, but alongside Gellar she really was the lesser character and actor. I'm not saying the two should of switched roles, but a more compelling actor should have been chose for Julie's character, same for the character of Ray who was upstaged by the character the audience was supposed to loathe. The best scene of the film was definitely Helen's chase scene, it was suspenseful, frightening and scary. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and was sad to see the movie's gem bite the dust. It will be a memorable Horror scene for years to come, if only Gellar applied herself to more Horror orientated roles, she'd sure give Jamie Lee Curtis a run for her money. All in all, I believe 30% of this film's audience was disappointed in how unfaithful the movie was to the book. I was able to look past this fact, putting aside the miscasting of roles and was able to accept this movie as the underrated brilliant Slasher flick that it is. 8/10, B+.

    15 years after this movie came out, I watched this movie. Not out of fear, if anything scared me, I was afraid that this would be Dawson's Creek with serial killers and on a personal note that is scarier that ANY horror movie icon could ever be, but I digress, let's get to it. Basic Story Guide (contains a few spoilers) After attending a beauty pageant, Julie James, Helen Shivers, Ray Bronson, and Barry Cox, are driving home after celebrating their last year together. As Barry's drink falls on Ray (who is driving), they all hear a THUD! the sound of a high velocity impact. Upon inspecting the car, and suspecting that it may have been an animal, Julie makes a horrifying discovery: a boot. A few feet away, they find the mutilated remains of a man. After debating on going to the police, the four decide that the best course of action is to dump the man in the river, and NEVER speaking of this again. One year later, Julie receives a message that only contains seven words: "I know what you did last summer." Before I give you the verdict I will say this, I am fan of 90's slashers and 90's horror movies. The Craft, The Faculity, Sleepy Hollow, Urban Legend, Scream even Scary Movie (a parody of 90's slasher movies so I love it), etc. So my opinion of this maybe a little bias but I will give you my honest opinion from how I feel about it. Verdict: Other than a few plot holes and numerous clich&eacute;s, over all it's a solid 90's horror movie. Well acted, and good energy between four main characters. Descent tension but a little weak on scares. And it contains one the best chase scenes. Sarah Michelle Geller sells it well. Overall 7/10

    There's no doubt that writer Kevin Williamson has a talent for this genre. Although he he describes cruel murders much better then he describes characters, that can' t be contested. Williamson is not able to to unravel the story as well as he has done before - and after this movie. It started out well, but was taken down to earth too quickly, director Jim Gillespie it not too known to me, so I can' t really on his abilities. This seems to be the perfect movie for young people who love horror movies. It looks like this particular resipe has became a trend in the last years, just like in the 70s and the 80s. Pretty young people in a horror scenario of dimensions, a mad killer on the loose with his bloody hook. The movie is realtive creepy, and has several hard hitting surprise along the way. There may be too many stereotypes though, and the young cries vigor related to an extreme evil murderer wasn' t especially credible - nor original. But the plot and effects still kept it interesting and tense - so I couldn't expect more from a movie in this genre. Good horror, but the characters were disappointing.

As Barry's drink falls on Ray (who is driving), they all hear a THUD! the sound of a high velocity impact. Upon inspecting the car, and suspecting that it may have been an animal, Julie makes a horrifying discovery: a boot. A few feet away, they find the mutilated remains of a man. After debating on going to the police, the four decide that the best course of action is to dump the man in the river, and NEVER speaking of this again. One year later, Julie receives a message that only contains seven words: "I know what you did last summer." Before I give you the verdict I will say this, I am fan of 90's slashers and 90's horror movies. The Craft, The Faculity, Sleepy Hollow, Urban Legend, Scream even Scary Movie (a parody of 90's slasher movies so I love it), etc. So my opinion of this maybe a little bias but I will give you my honest opinion from how I feel about it. Verdict: Other than a few plot holes and numerous clich&eacute;s, over all it's a solid 90's horror movie. Well acted, and good energy between four main characters. Descent tension but a little weak on scares. And it contains one the best chase scenes. Sarah Michelle Geller sells it well. Overall 7/10

    There's no doubt that writer Kevin Williamson has a talent for this genre. Although he he describes cruel murders much better then he describes characters, that can' t be contested. Williamson is not able to to unravel the story as well as he has done before - and after this movie. It started out well, but was taken down to earth too quickly, director Jim Gillespie it not too known to me, so I can' t really on his abilities. This seems to be the perfect movie for young people who love horror movies. It looks like this particular resipe has became a trend in the last years, just like in the 70s and the 80s. Pretty young people in a horror scenario of dimensions, a mad killer on the loose with his bloody hook. The movie is realtive creepy, and has several hard hitting surprise along the way. There may be too many stereotypes though, and the young cries vigor related to an extreme evil murderer wasn' t especially credible - nor original. But the plot and effects still kept it interesting and tense - so I couldn't expect more from a movie in this genre. Good horror, but the characters were disappointing.

    Do you know what you did last summer? Well Jennifer Love Hewitt (Julie James), Freddie Prinze Jr. (Ray Bronson), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Helen Shivers) and Ryan Phillipe (Barry Cox)remember what they did in the summer of 1997. They played four teenagers who accidentally ran over a man on the road and dumped his body over a cliff into the sea. A year after the accident, Julie receives a note telling her that someone knows their secret from the year before. Soon a murderous fisherman with a hook begins stalking them and murdering those around the four to get to the four teens. The acting in this film is not the greatest that any of the four principals in the film as they are picked off one by one. The plot is based on the young adult novel by Lois Duncan, but there are differences however I can't tell what they are if you have not read the book. The suspense in the film is lacking as you can usually predict when the killer is going to strike or when a body is going to be found. But if you want want to see this movie, then by all means do so.

    Not seen this movie for years and really enjoyed it on my last watch. I found this movie very entertaining and never found it boring, it did not bother me that was no real fun factor that the scream series had but still enjoyed it. I did like some of the kills scenes were decent but nothing compare to past slasher movies like Ghost face as they went not gory or memorable as them however there was some blood moments in the movie. The acting from the well know cast was outstanding and there were one or two tense moment in this movie, which I thought really good and made the killer fish man look bit scary at least. The twist was a little disappointing as you can see coming, I going to give this movie 7 out of 10

    Hewitt, Gellar, Hech, Phillippe, Freddie Prinze Jr., Bridgette Wilson- Sampras, and Johnny Galecki show you how entertaining a great cast can make a decent slasher script. Gellar and Phillippe were so good together, they were reunited two years later in another classic, Cruel Intentions. This film's general concept is cool, and I appreciate the unexpected resolution of some of the scenes, but too many of the other scenes are run-of-the-mill, some of the stunts are hokey, and some of the dialogue is cheesy. Still, I'm a fan of this cast and the hook-man urban legend, so I consider this flick a slasher classic. Your life won't be incomplete if you never see this movie, but it's worth watching if you ever stumble across it. On a final note, if you're trying to get your squeamish girlfriend to watch a horror film with you, this movie is a great set of training wheels. It is one of the mildest slasher flicks I've seen. I'm actually surprised it got an R rating.

    (Plot) Four good looking teens commit inadvertent manslaughter after a night of celebrating, and there lives change forever one year later after people start turning up dead. I enjoy this film a lot for what it is. There I said it. I'm not ashamed to admit it to you either. After Scream came out and redefined the genre, many crappy slashers followed in pursuit to try and replicate it. It did have a few that were fun, and this badboy is one of them. This movie is very, very slick. The killer himself isn't all that imposing. A man with a hoodie and a hook just doesn't cut it for me. They really should have picked a killer that looked menacing. The stalk sequences make up for it though. They are consummate and highly suspenseful. The lengthy stalk sequence between The Fisherman & Helen (Gellar) was something else. It was stylish and had me on the edge of my seat like I was waiting for Jennifer Love Hewitt to arrive to be my date. Speaking of JLH. The woman is serious scream queen material. I don't know if it was fear of typecasting or what, but she hasn't done a whole lot of horror since these movies. Granted, the sequel is atrocious, but I felt she was very solid here. She was likable, and screamed like a champ. She had the acting chops, the looks, and everything else. I loved how vulnerable her character became and how leery she was due to guilt. She pulled it off perfectly. Freddie Prinze Jr. is another story. Man, was he awful. Has he ever heard of acting classes? He should really take one. He was pretty bad to say the least. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a hottie, and likable to boot. She's involved in one of my favorite scenes in this film "the hair cutting" scene. Ryan Phillippe plays a great jock. His character was a real jerk, and he excelled at it, but I couldn't help but like him. Bridgette Wilson plays snotty to a T. Not much more to it than that. My only real complaints are is that Anne Heche's role is completely disposable. What was the point of her in this movie again? I also thought the ending was way too cheesy. It's like they were pressured to give the people a quick jolt at the end, and to setup the sequel. I deem it completely unnecessary. Final Thoughts: I'm probably gonna get a lot of dirty looks after people read this review, but oh, well. I like it a lot and that's all there is to it. For an era of crappy slashers, this is one I can always go back to and have a blast. If you haven't seen it, to quote Jennifer Love Hewitt in this film "WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??" 6.3/10

    Yay! A horror movie that is actually a little scary! I only watched this because Johnny Galecki was from "Roseanne", and Sarah Michelle Gellar. But it was really good! Great acting. Now, whenever I see Jennifer Love Hewitt on a commercial or something, I think, "Hey! It's that girl from 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'!" This movie is very original and a good adaptation of a book, one of the best. Great movie and not a bad sequel. It is, rated R for horror violence and language. Very creepy movie and very suspenseful, and I recommend buying or watching this movie. Very good.

    A lot of people liked this movie when it came out but even when it first came out I thought it was garbage and not even the slighest bit scary and I was about nine years old. The acting was terrible the plot was silly and all over the place. Just not a very good attempt not even worth watching. This movie is about a group of friends while out one night partying, drinking and driving they hit a man. They check on him and assume he is dead so they throw him into the ocean so not to get in trouble by the cops. Even though they were the only ones there but then they start getting harassed by someone saying I know what you did last summer. This movie was not good at all. I will never understand why people justify making a slasher horror movie PG-13 like give me a break give this movie an R and a new cast and it might be something watchable.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer is a horror mystery slasher film based loosely off the book by Lois Duncan of the same name. The film stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr., and features Anne Heche and Bridgette Wilson in supporting roles. The screenplay was written by Kevin Williamson and directed by Jim Gillespie. During the annual July 4th festivities in a North Carolina fishing town, Helen wins a local beauty contest and departs with her boyfriend Barry and pals Julie and Ray. On their way back home, Ray hits a fisherman with her car. The teens panic, drop the body in the water, and abandon the scene. Many months later when Julie returns from college, she gets an anonymous note,"I know what you did last summer." The four teens suspect the note was written by their classmate Max, but then Max is murdered and the terror begins. Teasing and taut, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a teen horror flick with a different kind of kick to it.It is a smart, sharply drawn horror genre film with a moral center and a solid cast which provides a fun, energetic and scary movie.No wonder it was a big hit during the 90's.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHNMkUwKxbI (Modernized Re-Cut Teaser) Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Barry (Ryan Phillipe) are four friends that make a grave mistake when they choose to cover up their hit and run of a town local on the July 4th weekend. One year later, Julie receives an ominous letter that reunites the four friends, however not for long when they realize that secret that they buried, wasn't actually dead... The thing that annoys me the most about this movie has nothing to do with the movie, it's the audience. A 5.5 star rating is a ridiculous for a great suspenseful Slasher flick like this. It easily tops all of the other Scream inspired slashers and is it's own film, without overdosing on movie references. IKWYDLS has a great script written by Kevin Williamson, John Debney's direction is great and the cinematography looks superb. The suspense is built through the magnificent score thanks to Shirley Walker in scenes such as Gellar's chase scene and Love-Hewitt's body in the trunk sequence. The film has an interesting concept that by now you've seen or read a few times, but it is still an interesting concept nonetheless. The film's villain, The Fisherman, creates a great feeling of lurking dread. His on screen appearance is quite menacing, bearing a fisherman's black coat and a deadly slicker. The biggest downfall ultimately of this movie is the casting of the lead roles. Sarah Michelle Gellar undeniably steals the show from Jennifer Love-Hewitt in her role as Helen Shivers, the beauty queen with the shattered dream. Even Ryan Phillipe as Barry Cox who is the arrogant typical rich jock is far superior than Freddie Prinze Jr., who might I add, has a cringe worthy performance. Jennifer plays her character well, but alongside Gellar she really was the lesser character and actor. I'm not saying the two should of switched roles, but a more compelling actor should have been chose for Julie's character, same for the character of Ray who was upstaged by the character the audience was supposed to loathe. The best scene of the film was definitely Helen's chase scene, it was suspenseful, frightening and scary. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and was sad to see the movie's gem bite the dust. It will be a memorable Horror scene for years to come, if only Gellar applied herself to more Horror orientated roles, she'd sure give Jamie Lee Curtis a run for her money. All in all, I believe 30% of this film's audience was disappointed in how unfaithful the movie was to the book. I was able to look past this fact, putting aside the miscasting of roles and was able to accept this movie as the underrated brilliant Slasher flick that it is. 8/10, B+.

    15 years after this movie came out, I watched this movie. Not out of fear, if anything scared me, I was afraid that this would be Dawson's Creek with serial killers and on a personal note that is scarier that ANY horror movie icon could ever be, but I digress, let's get to it. Basic Story Guide (contains a few spoilers) After attending a beauty pageant, Julie James, Helen Shivers, Ray Bronson, and Barry Cox, are driving home after celebrating their last year together. As Barry's drink falls on Ray (who is driving), they all hear a THUD! the sound of a high velocity impact. Upon inspecting the car, and suspecting that it may have been an animal, Julie makes a horrifying discovery: a boot. A few feet away, they find the mutilated remains of a man. After debating on going to the police, the four decide that the best course of action is to dump the man in the river, and NEVER speaking of this again. One year later, Julie receives a message that only contains seven words: "I know what you did last summer." Before I give you the verdict I will say this, I am fan of 90's slashers and 90's horror movies. The Craft, The Faculity, Sleepy Hollow, Urban Legend, Scream even Scary Movie (a parody of 90's slasher movies so I love it), etc. So my opinion of this maybe a little bias but I will give you my honest opinion from how I feel about it. Verdict: Other than a few plot holes and numerous clich&eacute;s, over all it's a solid 90's horror movie. Well acted, and good energy between four main characters. Descent tension but a little weak on scares. And it contains one the best chase scenes. Sarah Michelle Geller sells it well. Overall 7/10

The film's villain, The Fisherman, creates a great feeling of lurking dread. His on screen appearance is quite menacing, bearing a fisherman's black coat and a deadly slicker. The biggest downfall ultimately of this movie is the casting of the lead roles. Sarah Michelle Gellar undeniably steals the show from Jennifer Love-Hewitt in her role as Helen Shivers, the beauty queen with the shattered dream. Even Ryan Phillipe as Barry Cox who is the arrogant typical rich jock is far superior than Freddie Prinze Jr., who might I add, has a cringe worthy performance. Jennifer plays her character well, but alongside Gellar she really was the lesser character and actor. I'm not saying the two should of switched roles, but a more compelling actor should have been chose for Julie's character, same for the character of Ray who was upstaged by the character the audience was supposed to loathe. The best scene of the film was definitely Helen's chase scene, it was suspenseful, frightening and scary. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and was sad to see the movie's gem bite the dust. It will be a memorable Horror scene for years to come, if only Gellar applied herself to more Horror orientated roles, she'd sure give Jamie Lee Curtis a run for her money. All in all, I believe 30% of this film's audience was disappointed in how unfaithful the movie was to the book. I was able to look past this fact, putting aside the miscasting of roles and was able to accept this movie as the underrated brilliant Slasher flick that it is. 8/10, B+.

    15 years after this movie came out, I watched this movie. Not out of fear, if anything scared me, I was afraid that this would be Dawson's Creek with serial killers and on a personal note that is scarier that ANY horror movie icon could ever be, but I digress, let's get to it. Basic Story Guide (contains a few spoilers) After attending a beauty pageant, Julie James, Helen Shivers, Ray Bronson, and Barry Cox, are driving home after celebrating their last year together. As Barry's drink falls on Ray (who is driving), they all hear a THUD! the sound of a high velocity impact. Upon inspecting the car, and suspecting that it may have been an animal, Julie makes a horrifying discovery: a boot. A few feet away, they find the mutilated remains of a man. After debating on going to the police, the four decide that the best course of action is to dump the man in the river, and NEVER speaking of this again. One year later, Julie receives a message that only contains seven words: "I know what you did last summer." Before I give you the verdict I will say this, I am fan of 90's slashers and 90's horror movies. The Craft, The Faculity, Sleepy Hollow, Urban Legend, Scream even Scary Movie (a parody of 90's slasher movies so I love it), etc. So my opinion of this maybe a little bias but I will give you my honest opinion from how I feel about it. Verdict: Other than a few plot holes and numerous clich&eacute;s, over all it's a solid 90's horror movie. Well acted, and good energy between four main characters. Descent tension but a little weak on scares. And it contains one the best chase scenes. Sarah Michelle Geller sells it well. Overall 7/10

    There's no doubt that writer Kevin Williamson has a talent for this genre. Although he he describes cruel murders much better then he describes characters, that can' t be contested. Williamson is not able to to unravel the story as well as he has done before - and after this movie. It started out well, but was taken down to earth too quickly, director Jim Gillespie it not too known to me, so I can' t really on his abilities. This seems to be the perfect movie for young people who love horror movies. It looks like this particular resipe has became a trend in the last years, just like in the 70s and the 80s. Pretty young people in a horror scenario of dimensions, a mad killer on the loose with his bloody hook. The movie is realtive creepy, and has several hard hitting surprise along the way. There may be too many stereotypes though, and the young cries vigor related to an extreme evil murderer wasn' t especially credible - nor original. But the plot and effects still kept it interesting and tense - so I couldn't expect more from a movie in this genre. Good horror, but the characters were disappointing.

    Do you know what you did last summer? Well Jennifer Love Hewitt (Julie James), Freddie Prinze Jr. (Ray Bronson), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Helen Shivers) and Ryan Phillipe (Barry Cox)remember what they did in the summer of 1997. They played four teenagers who accidentally ran over a man on the road and dumped his body over a cliff into the sea. A year after the accident, Julie receives a note telling her that someone knows their secret from the year before. Soon a murderous fisherman with a hook begins stalking them and murdering those around the four to get to the four teens. The acting in this film is not the greatest that any of the four principals in the film as they are picked off one by one. The plot is based on the young adult novel by Lois Duncan, but there are differences however I can't tell what they are if you have not read the book. The suspense in the film is lacking as you can usually predict when the killer is going to strike or when a body is going to be found. But if you want want to see this movie, then by all means do so.

    Not seen this movie for years and really enjoyed it on my last watch. I found this movie very entertaining and never found it boring, it did not bother me that was no real fun factor that the scream series had but still enjoyed it. I did like some of the kills scenes were decent but nothing compare to past slasher movies like Ghost face as they went not gory or memorable as them however there was some blood moments in the movie. The acting from the well know cast was outstanding and there were one or two tense moment in this movie, which I thought really good and made the killer fish man look bit scary at least. The twist was a little disappointing as you can see coming, I going to give this movie 7 out of 10

    Hewitt, Gellar, Hech, Phillippe, Freddie Prinze Jr., Bridgette Wilson- Sampras, and Johnny Galecki show you how entertaining a great cast can make a decent slasher script. Gellar and Phillippe were so good together, they were reunited two years later in another classic, Cruel Intentions. This film's general concept is cool, and I appreciate the unexpected resolution of some of the scenes, but too many of the other scenes are run-of-the-mill, some of the stunts are hokey, and some of the dialogue is cheesy. Still, I'm a fan of this cast and the hook-man urban legend, so I consider this flick a slasher classic. Your life won't be incomplete if you never see this movie, but it's worth watching if you ever stumble across it. On a final note, if you're trying to get your squeamish girlfriend to watch a horror film with you, this movie is a great set of training wheels. It is one of the mildest slasher flicks I've seen. I'm actually surprised it got an R rating.

    (Plot) Four good looking teens commit inadvertent manslaughter after a night of celebrating, and there lives change forever one year later after people start turning up dead. I enjoy this film a lot for what it is. There I said it. I'm not ashamed to admit it to you either. After Scream came out and redefined the genre, many crappy slashers followed in pursuit to try and replicate it. It did have a few that were fun, and this badboy is one of them. This movie is very, very slick. The killer himself isn't all that imposing. A man with a hoodie and a hook just doesn't cut it for me. They really should have picked a killer that looked menacing. The stalk sequences make up for it though. They are consummate and highly suspenseful. The lengthy stalk sequence between The Fisherman & Helen (Gellar) was something else. It was stylish and had me on the edge of my seat like I was waiting for Jennifer Love Hewitt to arrive to be my date. Speaking of JLH. The woman is serious scream queen material. I don't know if it was fear of typecasting or what, but she hasn't done a whole lot of horror since these movies. Granted, the sequel is atrocious, but I felt she was very solid here. She was likable, and screamed like a champ. She had the acting chops, the looks, and everything else. I loved how vulnerable her character became and how leery she was due to guilt. She pulled it off perfectly. Freddie Prinze Jr. is another story. Man, was he awful. Has he ever heard of acting classes? He should really take one. He was pretty bad to say the least. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a hottie, and likable to boot. She's involved in one of my favorite scenes in this film "the hair cutting" scene. Ryan Phillippe plays a great jock. His character was a real jerk, and he excelled at it, but I couldn't help but like him. Bridgette Wilson plays snotty to a T. Not much more to it than that. My only real complaints are is that Anne Heche's role is completely disposable. What was the point of her in this movie again? I also thought the ending was way too cheesy. It's like they were pressured to give the people a quick jolt at the end, and to setup the sequel. I deem it completely unnecessary. Final Thoughts: I'm probably gonna get a lot of dirty looks after people read this review, but oh, well. I like it a lot and that's all there is to it. For an era of crappy slashers, this is one I can always go back to and have a blast. If you haven't seen it, to quote Jennifer Love Hewitt in this film "WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??" 6.3/10

    Yay! A horror movie that is actually a little scary! I only watched this because Johnny Galecki was from "Roseanne", and Sarah Michelle Gellar. But it was really good! Great acting. Now, whenever I see Jennifer Love Hewitt on a commercial or something, I think, "Hey! It's that girl from 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'!" This movie is very original and a good adaptation of a book, one of the best. Great movie and not a bad sequel. It is, rated R for horror violence and language. Very creepy movie and very suspenseful, and I recommend buying or watching this movie. Very good.

    A lot of people liked this movie when it came out but even when it first came out I thought it was garbage and not even the slighest bit scary and I was about nine years old. The acting was terrible the plot was silly and all over the place. Just not a very good attempt not even worth watching. This movie is about a group of friends while out one night partying, drinking and driving they hit a man. They check on him and assume he is dead so they throw him into the ocean so not to get in trouble by the cops. Even though they were the only ones there but then they start getting harassed by someone saying I know what you did last summer. This movie was not good at all. I will never understand why people justify making a slasher horror movie PG-13 like give me a break give this movie an R and a new cast and it might be something watchable.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer is a horror mystery slasher film based loosely off the book by Lois Duncan of the same name. The film stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr., and features Anne Heche and Bridgette Wilson in supporting roles. The screenplay was written by Kevin Williamson and directed by Jim Gillespie. During the annual July 4th festivities in a North Carolina fishing town, Helen wins a local beauty contest and departs with her boyfriend Barry and pals Julie and Ray. On their way back home, Ray hits a fisherman with her car. The teens panic, drop the body in the water, and abandon the scene. Many months later when Julie returns from college, she gets an anonymous note,"I know what you did last summer." The four teens suspect the note was written by their classmate Max, but then Max is murdered and the terror begins. Teasing and taut, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a teen horror flick with a different kind of kick to it.It is a smart, sharply drawn horror genre film with a moral center and a solid cast which provides a fun, energetic and scary movie.No wonder it was a big hit during the 90's.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHNMkUwKxbI (Modernized Re-Cut Teaser) Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Barry (Ryan Phillipe) are four friends that make a grave mistake when they choose to cover up their hit and run of a town local on the July 4th weekend. One year later, Julie receives an ominous letter that reunites the four friends, however not for long when they realize that secret that they buried, wasn't actually dead... The thing that annoys me the most about this movie has nothing to do with the movie, it's the audience. A 5.5 star rating is a ridiculous for a great suspenseful Slasher flick like this. It easily tops all of the other Scream inspired slashers and is it's own film, without overdosing on movie references. IKWYDLS has a great script written by Kevin Williamson, John Debney's direction is great and the cinematography looks superb. The suspense is built through the magnificent score thanks to Shirley Walker in scenes such as Gellar's chase scene and Love-Hewitt's body in the trunk sequence. The film has an interesting concept that by now you've seen or read a few times, but it is still an interesting concept nonetheless. The film's villain, The Fisherman, creates a great feeling of lurking dread. His on screen appearance is quite menacing, bearing a fisherman's black coat and a deadly slicker. The biggest downfall ultimately of this movie is the casting of the lead roles. Sarah Michelle Gellar undeniably steals the show from Jennifer Love-Hewitt in her role as Helen Shivers, the beauty queen with the shattered dream. Even Ryan Phillipe as Barry Cox who is the arrogant typical rich jock is far superior than Freddie Prinze Jr., who might I add, has a cringe worthy performance. Jennifer plays her character well, but alongside Gellar she really was the lesser character and actor. I'm not saying the two should of switched roles, but a more compelling actor should have been chose for Julie's character, same for the character of Ray who was upstaged by the character the audience was supposed to loathe. The best scene of the film was definitely Helen's chase scene, it was suspenseful, frightening and scary. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and was sad to see the movie's gem bite the dust. It will be a memorable Horror scene for years to come, if only Gellar applied herself to more Horror orientated roles, she'd sure give Jamie Lee Curtis a run for her money. All in all, I believe 30% of this film's audience was disappointed in how unfaithful the movie was to the book. I was able to look past this fact, putting aside the miscasting of roles and was able to accept this movie as the underrated brilliant Slasher flick that it is. 8/10, B+.

On their way back home, Ray hits a fisherman with her car. The teens panic, drop the body in the water, and abandon the scene. Many months later when Julie returns from college, she gets an anonymous note,"I know what you did last summer." The four teens suspect the note was written by their classmate Max, but then Max is murdered and the terror begins. Teasing and taut, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a teen horror flick with a different kind of kick to it.It is a smart, sharply drawn horror genre film with a moral center and a solid cast which provides a fun, energetic and scary movie.No wonder it was a big hit during the 90's.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHNMkUwKxbI (Modernized Re-Cut Teaser) Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Barry (Ryan Phillipe) are four friends that make a grave mistake when they choose to cover up their hit and run of a town local on the July 4th weekend. One year later, Julie receives an ominous letter that reunites the four friends, however not for long when they realize that secret that they buried, wasn't actually dead... The thing that annoys me the most about this movie has nothing to do with the movie, it's the audience. A 5.5 star rating is a ridiculous for a great suspenseful Slasher flick like this. It easily tops all of the other Scream inspired slashers and is it's own film, without overdosing on movie references. IKWYDLS has a great script written by Kevin Williamson, John Debney's direction is great and the cinematography looks superb. The suspense is built through the magnificent score thanks to Shirley Walker in scenes such as Gellar's chase scene and Love-Hewitt's body in the trunk sequence. The film has an interesting concept that by now you've seen or read a few times, but it is still an interesting concept nonetheless. The film's villain, The Fisherman, creates a great feeling of lurking dread. His on screen appearance is quite menacing, bearing a fisherman's black coat and a deadly slicker. The biggest downfall ultimately of this movie is the casting of the lead roles. Sarah Michelle Gellar undeniably steals the show from Jennifer Love-Hewitt in her role as Helen Shivers, the beauty queen with the shattered dream. Even Ryan Phillipe as Barry Cox who is the arrogant typical rich jock is far superior than Freddie Prinze Jr., who might I add, has a cringe worthy performance. Jennifer plays her character well, but alongside Gellar she really was the lesser character and actor. I'm not saying the two should of switched roles, but a more compelling actor should have been chose for Julie's character, same for the character of Ray who was upstaged by the character the audience was supposed to loathe. The best scene of the film was definitely Helen's chase scene, it was suspenseful, frightening and scary. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and was sad to see the movie's gem bite the dust. It will be a memorable Horror scene for years to come, if only Gellar applied herself to more Horror orientated roles, she'd sure give Jamie Lee Curtis a run for her money. All in all, I believe 30% of this film's audience was disappointed in how unfaithful the movie was to the book. I was able to look past this fact, putting aside the miscasting of roles and was able to accept this movie as the underrated brilliant Slasher flick that it is. 8/10, B+.

    15 years after this movie came out, I watched this movie. Not out of fear, if anything scared me, I was afraid that this would be Dawson's Creek with serial killers and on a personal note that is scarier that ANY horror movie icon could ever be, but I digress, let's get to it. Basic Story Guide (contains a few spoilers) After attending a beauty pageant, Julie James, Helen Shivers, Ray Bronson, and Barry Cox, are driving home after celebrating their last year together. As Barry's drink falls on Ray (who is driving), they all hear a THUD! the sound of a high velocity impact. Upon inspecting the car, and suspecting that it may have been an animal, Julie makes a horrifying discovery: a boot. A few feet away, they find the mutilated remains of a man. After debating on going to the police, the four decide that the best course of action is to dump the man in the river, and NEVER speaking of this again. One year later, Julie receives a message that only contains seven words: "I know what you did last summer." Before I give you the verdict I will say this, I am fan of 90's slashers and 90's horror movies. The Craft, The Faculity, Sleepy Hollow, Urban Legend, Scream even Scary Movie (a parody of 90's slasher movies so I love it), etc. So my opinion of this maybe a little bias but I will give you my honest opinion from how I feel about it. Verdict: Other than a few plot holes and numerous clich&eacute;s, over all it's a solid 90's horror movie. Well acted, and good energy between four main characters. Descent tension but a little weak on scares. And it contains one the best chase scenes. Sarah Michelle Geller sells it well. Overall 7/10

    There's no doubt that writer Kevin Williamson has a talent for this genre. Although he he describes cruel murders much better then he describes characters, that can' t be contested. Williamson is not able to to unravel the story as well as he has done before - and after this movie. It started out well, but was taken down to earth too quickly, director Jim Gillespie it not too known to me, so I can' t really on his abilities. This seems to be the perfect movie for young people who love horror movies. It looks like this particular resipe has became a trend in the last years, just like in the 70s and the 80s. Pretty young people in a horror scenario of dimensions, a mad killer on the loose with his bloody hook. The movie is realtive creepy, and has several hard hitting surprise along the way. There may be too many stereotypes though, and the young cries vigor related to an extreme evil murderer wasn' t especially credible - nor original. But the plot and effects still kept it interesting and tense - so I couldn't expect more from a movie in this genre. Good horror, but the characters were disappointing.

    Do you know what you did last summer? Well Jennifer Love Hewitt (Julie James), Freddie Prinze Jr. (Ray Bronson), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Helen Shivers) and Ryan Phillipe (Barry Cox)remember what they did in the summer of 1997. They played four teenagers who accidentally ran over a man on the road and dumped his body over a cliff into the sea. A year after the accident, Julie receives a note telling her that someone knows their secret from the year before. Soon a murderous fisherman with a hook begins stalking them and murdering those around the four to get to the four teens. The acting in this film is not the greatest that any of the four principals in the film as they are picked off one by one. The plot is based on the young adult novel by Lois Duncan, but there are differences however I can't tell what they are if you have not read the book. The suspense in the film is lacking as you can usually predict when the killer is going to strike or when a body is going to be found. But if you want want to see this movie, then by all means do so.

    Not seen this movie for years and really enjoyed it on my last watch. I found this movie very entertaining and never found it boring, it did not bother me that was no real fun factor that the scream series had but still enjoyed it. I did like some of the kills scenes were decent but nothing compare to past slasher movies like Ghost face as they went not gory or memorable as them however there was some blood moments in the movie. The acting from the well know cast was outstanding and there were one or two tense moment in this movie, which I thought really good and made the killer fish man look bit scary at least. The twist was a little disappointing as you can see coming, I going to give this movie 7 out of 10

    Hewitt, Gellar, Hech, Phillippe, Freddie Prinze Jr., Bridgette Wilson- Sampras, and Johnny Galecki show you how entertaining a great cast can make a decent slasher script. Gellar and Phillippe were so good together, they were reunited two years later in another classic, Cruel Intentions. This film's general concept is cool, and I appreciate the unexpected resolution of some of the scenes, but too many of the other scenes are run-of-the-mill, some of the stunts are hokey, and some of the dialogue is cheesy. Still, I'm a fan of this cast and the hook-man urban legend, so I consider this flick a slasher classic. Your life won't be incomplete if you never see this movie, but it's worth watching if you ever stumble across it. On a final note, if you're trying to get your squeamish girlfriend to watch a horror film with you, this movie is a great set of training wheels. It is one of the mildest slasher flicks I've seen. I'm actually surprised it got an R rating.

    (Plot) Four good looking teens commit inadvertent manslaughter after a night of celebrating, and there lives change forever one year later after people start turning up dead. I enjoy this film a lot for what it is. There I said it. I'm not ashamed to admit it to you either. After Scream came out and redefined the genre, many crappy slashers followed in pursuit to try and replicate it. It did have a few that were fun, and this badboy is one of them. This movie is very, very slick. The killer himself isn't all that imposing. A man with a hoodie and a hook just doesn't cut it for me. They really should have picked a killer that looked menacing. The stalk sequences make up for it though. They are consummate and highly suspenseful. The lengthy stalk sequence between The Fisherman & Helen (Gellar) was something else. It was stylish and had me on the edge of my seat like I was waiting for Jennifer Love Hewitt to arrive to be my date. Speaking of JLH. The woman is serious scream queen material. I don't know if it was fear of typecasting or what, but she hasn't done a whole lot of horror since these movies. Granted, the sequel is atrocious, but I felt she was very solid here. She was likable, and screamed like a champ. She had the acting chops, the looks, and everything else. I loved how vulnerable her character became and how leery she was due to guilt. She pulled it off perfectly. Freddie Prinze Jr. is another story. Man, was he awful. Has he ever heard of acting classes? He should really take one. He was pretty bad to say the least. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a hottie, and likable to boot. She's involved in one of my favorite scenes in this film "the hair cutting" scene. Ryan Phillippe plays a great jock. His character was a real jerk, and he excelled at it, but I couldn't help but like him. Bridgette Wilson plays snotty to a T. Not much more to it than that. My only real complaints are is that Anne Heche's role is completely disposable. What was the point of her in this movie again? I also thought the ending was way too cheesy. It's like they were pressured to give the people a quick jolt at the end, and to setup the sequel. I deem it completely unnecessary. Final Thoughts: I'm probably gonna get a lot of dirty looks after people read this review, but oh, well. I like it a lot and that's all there is to it. For an era of crappy slashers, this is one I can always go back to and have a blast. If you haven't seen it, to quote Jennifer Love Hewitt in this film "WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??" 6.3/10

    Yay! A horror movie that is actually a little scary! I only watched this because Johnny Galecki was from "Roseanne", and Sarah Michelle Gellar. But it was really good! Great acting. Now, whenever I see Jennifer Love Hewitt on a commercial or something, I think, "Hey! It's that girl from 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'!" This movie is very original and a good adaptation of a book, one of the best. Great movie and not a bad sequel. It is, rated R for horror violence and language. Very creepy movie and very suspenseful, and I recommend buying or watching this movie. Very good.

    A lot of people liked this movie when it came out but even when it first came out I thought it was garbage and not even the slighest bit scary and I was about nine years old. The acting was terrible the plot was silly and all over the place. Just not a very good attempt not even worth watching. This movie is about a group of friends while out one night partying, drinking and driving they hit a man. They check on him and assume he is dead so they throw him into the ocean so not to get in trouble by the cops. Even though they were the only ones there but then they start getting harassed by someone saying I know what you did last summer. This movie was not good at all. I will never understand why people justify making a slasher horror movie PG-13 like give me a break give this movie an R and a new cast and it might be something watchable.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer is a horror mystery slasher film based loosely off the book by Lois Duncan of the same name. The film stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr., and features Anne Heche and Bridgette Wilson in supporting roles. The screenplay was written by Kevin Williamson and directed by Jim Gillespie. During the annual July 4th festivities in a North Carolina fishing town, Helen wins a local beauty contest and departs with her boyfriend Barry and pals Julie and Ray. On their way back home, Ray hits a fisherman with her car. The teens panic, drop the body in the water, and abandon the scene. Many months later when Julie returns from college, she gets an anonymous note,"I know what you did last summer." The four teens suspect the note was written by their classmate Max, but then Max is murdered and the terror begins. Teasing and taut, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a teen horror flick with a different kind of kick to it.It is a smart, sharply drawn horror genre film with a moral center and a solid cast which provides a fun, energetic and scary movie.No wonder it was a big hit during the 90's.

Very creepy movie and very suspenseful, and I recommend buying or watching this movie. Very good.

    A lot of people liked this movie when it came out but even when it first came out I thought it was garbage and not even the slighest bit scary and I was about nine years old. The acting was terrible the plot was silly and all over the place. Just not a very good attempt not even worth watching. This movie is about a group of friends while out one night partying, drinking and driving they hit a man. They check on him and assume he is dead so they throw him into the ocean so not to get in trouble by the cops. Even though they were the only ones there but then they start getting harassed by someone saying I know what you did last summer. This movie was not good at all. I will never understand why people justify making a slasher horror movie PG-13 like give me a break give this movie an R and a new cast and it might be something watchable.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer is a horror mystery slasher film based loosely off the book by Lois Duncan of the same name. The film stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr., and features Anne Heche and Bridgette Wilson in supporting roles. The screenplay was written by Kevin Williamson and directed by Jim Gillespie. During the annual July 4th festivities in a North Carolina fishing town, Helen wins a local beauty contest and departs with her boyfriend Barry and pals Julie and Ray. On their way back home, Ray hits a fisherman with her car. The teens panic, drop the body in the water, and abandon the scene. Many months later when Julie returns from college, she gets an anonymous note,"I know what you did last summer." The four teens suspect the note was written by their classmate Max, but then Max is murdered and the terror begins. Teasing and taut, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a teen horror flick with a different kind of kick to it.It is a smart, sharply drawn horror genre film with a moral center and a solid cast which provides a fun, energetic and scary movie.No wonder it was a big hit during the 90's.

    I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHNMkUwKxbI (Modernized Re-Cut Teaser) Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Barry (Ryan Phillipe) are four friends that make a grave mistake when they choose to cover up their hit and run of a town local on the July 4th weekend. One year later, Julie receives an ominous letter that reunites the four friends, however not for long when they realize that secret that they buried, wasn't actually dead... The thing that annoys me the most about this movie has nothing to do with the movie, it's the audience. A 5.5 star rating is a ridiculous for a great suspenseful Slasher flick like this. It easily tops all of the other Scream inspired slashers and is it's own film, without overdosing on movie references. IKWYDLS has a great script written by Kevin Williamson, John Debney's direction is great and the cinematography looks superb. The suspense is built through the magnificent score thanks to Shirley Walker in scenes such as Gellar's chase scene and Love-Hewitt's body in the trunk sequence. The film has an interesting concept that by now you've seen or read a few times, but it is still an interesting concept nonetheless. The film's villain, The Fisherman, creates a great feeling of lurking dread. His on screen appearance is quite menacing, bearing a fisherman's black coat and a deadly slicker. The biggest downfall ultimately of this movie is the casting of the lead roles. Sarah Michelle Gellar undeniably steals the show from Jennifer Love-Hewitt in her role as Helen Shivers, the beauty queen with the shattered dream. Even Ryan Phillipe as Barry Cox who is the arrogant typical rich jock is far superior than Freddie Prinze Jr., who might I add, has a cringe worthy performance. Jennifer plays her character well, but alongside Gellar she really was the lesser character and actor. I'm not saying the two should of switched roles, but a more compelling actor should have been chose for Julie's character, same for the character of Ray who was upstaged by the character the audience was supposed to loathe. The best scene of the film was definitely Helen's chase scene, it was suspenseful, frightening and scary. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and was sad to see the movie's gem bite the dust. It will be a memorable Horror scene for years to come, if only Gellar applied herself to more Horror orientated roles, she'd sure give Jamie Lee Curtis a run for her money. All in all, I believe 30% of this film's audience was disappointed in how unfaithful the movie was to the book. I was able to look past this fact, putting aside the miscasting of roles and was able to accept this movie as the underrated brilliant Slasher flick that it is. 8/10, B+.

    15 years after this movie came out, I watched this movie. Not out of fear, if anything scared me, I was afraid that this would be Dawson's Creek with serial killers and on a personal note that is scarier that ANY horror movie icon could ever be, but I digress, let's get to it. Basic Story Guide (contains a few spoilers) After attending a beauty pageant, Julie James, Helen Shivers, Ray Bronson, and Barry Cox, are driving home after celebrating their last year together. As Barry's drink falls on Ray (who is driving), they all hear a THUD! the sound of a high velocity impact. Upon inspecting the car, and suspecting that it may have been an animal, Julie makes a horrifying discovery: a boot. A few feet away, they find the mutilated remains of a man. After debating on going to the police, the four decide that the best course of action is to dump the man in the river, and NEVER speaking of this again. One year later, Julie receives a message that only contains seven words: "I know what you did last summer." Before I give you the verdict I will say this, I am fan of 90's slashers and 90's horror movies. The Craft, The Faculity, Sleepy Hollow, Urban Legend, Scream even Scary Movie (a parody of 90's slasher movies so I love it), etc. So my opinion of this maybe a little bias but I will give you my honest opinion from how I feel about it. Verdict: Other than a few plot holes and numerous clich&eacute;s, over all it's a solid 90's horror movie. Well acted, and good energy between four main characters. Descent tension but a little weak on scares. And it contains one the best chase scenes. Sarah Michelle Geller sells it well. Overall 7/10

    There's no doubt that writer Kevin Williamson has a talent for this genre. Although he he describes cruel murders much better then he describes characters, that can' t be contested. Williamson is not able to to unravel the story as well as he has done before - and after this movie. It started out well, but was taken down to earth too quickly, director Jim Gillespie it not too known to me, so I can' t really on his abilities. This seems to be the perfect movie for young people who love horror movies. It looks like this particular resipe has became a trend in the last years, just like in the 70s and the 80s. Pretty young people in a horror scenario of dimensions, a mad killer on the loose with his bloody hook. The movie is realtive creepy, and has several hard hitting surprise along the way. There may be too many stereotypes though, and the young cries vigor related to an extreme evil murderer wasn' t especially credible - nor original. But the plot and effects still kept it interesting and tense - so I couldn't expect more from a movie in this genre. Good horror, but the characters were disappointing.

    Do you know what you did last summer? Well Jennifer Love Hewitt (Julie James), Freddie Prinze Jr. (Ray Bronson), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Helen Shivers) and Ryan Phillipe (Barry Cox)remember what they did in the summer of 1997. They played four teenagers who accidentally ran over a man on the road and dumped his body over a cliff into the sea. A year after the accident, Julie receives a note telling her that someone knows their secret from the year before. Soon a murderous fisherman with a hook begins stalking them and murdering those around the four to get to the four teens. The acting in this film is not the greatest that any of the four principals in the film as they are picked off one by one. The plot is based on the young adult novel by Lois Duncan, but there are differences however I can't tell what they are if you have not read the book. The suspense in the film is lacking as you can usually predict when the killer is going to strike or when a body is going to be found. But if you want want to see this movie, then by all means do so.

    Not seen this movie for years and really enjoyed it on my last watch. I found this movie very entertaining and never found it boring, it did not bother me that was no real fun factor that the scream series had but still enjoyed it. I did like some of the kills scenes were decent but nothing compare to past slasher movies like Ghost face as they went not gory or memorable as them however there was some blood moments in the movie. The acting from the well know cast was outstanding and there were one or two tense moment in this movie, which I thought really good and made the killer fish man look bit scary at least. The twist was a little disappointing as you can see coming, I going to give this movie 7 out of 10

    Hewitt, Gellar, Hech, Phillippe, Freddie Prinze Jr., Bridgette Wilson- Sampras, and Johnny Galecki show you how entertaining a great cast can make a decent slasher script. Gellar and Phillippe were so good together, they were reunited two years later in another classic, Cruel Intentions. This film's general concept is cool, and I appreciate the unexpected resolution of some of the scenes, but too many of the other scenes are run-of-the-mill, some of the stunts are hokey, and some of the dialogue is cheesy. Still, I'm a fan of this cast and the hook-man urban legend, so I consider this flick a slasher classic. Your life won't be incomplete if you never see this movie, but it's worth watching if you ever stumble across it. On a final note, if you're trying to get your squeamish girlfriend to watch a horror film with you, this movie is a great set of training wheels. It is one of the mildest slasher flicks I've seen. I'm actually surprised it got an R rating.
