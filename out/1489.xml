    Those two words describe this movie best. I served in the Navy for 20 years, as an enlisted man, with a father who was also in the Navy and served in a Brig Recovery Unit. Bad acting coupled with failed attempts at humor are the watchwords for this film. Plus the numerous inaccuracies make watching it as a Sailor unbearable. One reviewer posted that this was a good example of how life is in the Navy . . . the French Navy perhaps, but not the United States Navy. Want a good Navy brig movie, watch the Last Detail. Want a good Navy comedy, watch Operation Petticoat or Down Periscope or even the horrible McHale's Navy movie. Why not 1 out of 10 . . . Erika Eleniak is good looking.

    "Chasers" vacillates wildly between military drama, and frat slobs on vacation silliness. There is a steady slide downhill in believability. The acting is only average, and the script well below that. Nevertheless, the movie is watchable, mainly because of the interesting supporting cast. The best scenes are with Gary Busey, Crispin Glover, and Dennis Hopper. The real problem is that the film doesn't have a flow, with sex scenes giving way to cartoon-like silliness, kung fu fighting, and ridiculous romance. I suppose if you can throw logic out the window, there might be enough here to interest some, but that's a long shot at best. - MERK

    no movie with dennis hopper, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu henner deserves a rating under 5 on here. This is a poor mans version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless Midnight run except the prisoner being transported here is the very easy on the eye Ms.Eleniak. Tom Berenger plays another gruff, maverick military type well and William Mcnamara plays his rookie-about to be discharged foil well. The plot on the face of it is absurd because I lost count of the times Eleniak should have and could have escaped but this is an entertaining feel-good movie and there are good cameos from all of the above actors that keep the movie rolling. This isn't really a family movie as there is some swearing and a rare nude scene with eleniak but this is a lot better than some of the other guff that came out around this time.

    **DEFINITE SPOILERS** Two Navy guys--gruff, old, mean Rock Reilly (Tom Berenger) and young, handsome, fun-loving Eddie Devane (William McNamara)--are assigned to transport a prisoner. Turns out she's a young beautiful blonde named Toni (Erika Eleniak). While driving her she tries to escape repeatedly. This leads to "comic" mishaps. However it turns out she really isn't a mean girl (just misunderstood)--Reilly becomes lovable--Devane falls in love with her (and vice versa)--and it all leads to a ridiculously improbable ending. As you can see the plot is just ridiculous (and predictable) and this is NOT a good movie--but I sort of liked it. Berenger and McNamara are very good and play off each other very well. Eleniak is beautiful and sexy and (surprisingly) not a bad actress. The situations they end up in are totally unbelievable and almost always unfunny but I laughed a few times. If you're watching this for t&a--forget it. It's about 50 minutes until Eleniak is in her underwear and another 20 minutes or so before she has a quick nude scene. As a gay guy I had no interest. Anyways McNamara shows more skin than her--he has a few scenes wearing nothing but underpants and once is totally nude. He's handsome and has a smooth, nicely toned body. As it is him and Eleniak became a couple after meeting in this movie. Also there are some familiar faces in small roles--Dean Stockwell, Crispin Glover, Seymour Cassel, Gary Busey, Frederic Forrest and Marilu Henner. Even director Dennis Hopper pops up in multiple roles! So, not a good movie but the acting is on target, there are funny moments and it has female AND male nudity. A pleasant time waster.

    ... so I thought I'd throw in a few words about William McNamara. Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities -- it's obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them -- or less. There's an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies. There's a nice bit where he has to chase after Miss Eleniak in the buff, with only his hands cupped over his groin. William McNamara is naturally a little on the skinny side, but he has a nice, generous handful of a booty. Also, there's a moment when he's getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada. If you're inclined to do so, and come on, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about Navy men on a "road trip" are. I'd just like thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity. Can William McNamara act? Heck if I know.

    The movie is not that bad if you are a fan of Erika Eleniak. Just to see her made my day. So if you think like me, is worth watching it. Tom Berenger a veteran navy officer assigned to escort young and beautiful Erika Eleniak on her way to base brig for assault and going AWOL. William McNamara, a navy officer? to help Tom on his tough commission aka duty. She tries to escape a few times "to no avail", then her master mind goes after William slaved already of her charms (and we get to watch the whole thing) Will she get away with it? Well you will just have to watch for yourself; no spoilers allowed or... Good actors in this movie even if they don't have to try hard on their play and ... by the way, this is an R rated movie in the U.S.A. Again, is worth watching.

    If you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor, then you will enjoy this flick. I don't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy this one. Take it for what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh. It ain't Shakespeare, but it is well done. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one - Better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows a knack for subtle humor. Too bad she hasn't had many opportunities to expand on that. Tom Berenger fits his role of "real Navy" perfectly and William McNamara does a solid job as a hustler. Throw in a walk-on by Hopper in the middle of the chase for "the Cherry on this Sundae" and you've got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing. I bought this one as soon as it was available. Brain-candy.

    Chasers is billed as a comedy-which would be fine-if it were a comedy.in reality it's more like a drama/slash action film with some humour sparsely sprinkled here and there.very sparsely sprinkled.it is mildly entertaining,but not worth watching more than once-at least for a long time.that says a lot,considering the fact that Erica Eleniak is in it.alas even she cannot elevate this movie to anything beyond average.Dennis Hopper directed this movie-why i'm not sure.yes there is some action and Hopper himself has a completely ridiculous and pointless cameo.if you have nothing better to do,you could use up 101 minutes of your life on this movie.it's not the worst movie you've seen or will see.but it is ,put simply-blah.in other words a completely forgettable movie. 5 * because of Erica

    Navy officials Berenger and McNamara are assigned to escort prisoner Eliniak to start serving time but their trip doesn't go all that smoothly. Despite the presence of the terribly annoying William McNamara, Chasers is really an O.K. way to spend less than two hours. Obviously it's not as good as 1973's The Last Detail but it has it's moments. Tom Berenger and Erika Eliniak compensate for McNamara and deliver good performances but the array of good cameos are sorely misused. Gary Busey and Crispin Glover provide a few chuckles but Dennis Hopper, Dean Stockwell and Marilu Henner have nothing to do here. Still, if you're in a forgiving frame of mind and keep your expectations low this film quite alright.

    Is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works by now, pretty woman is introduced in to a picture, someone has to fall in love with her. I think this film does follow some typical story lines, but that doesn't say anything about the content. There are great scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Busey, although short. Some things didn't make sense, such as the need to get in to random fights, but it is entertaining to watch, the fights were actually well done. This is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it. The humor is well balanced, you won't hurt your stomach on this, but you will keep a smile. There is a little bit of steamy action, so not one for the kids.

As it is him and Eleniak became a couple after meeting in this movie. Also there are some familiar faces in small roles--Dean Stockwell, Crispin Glover, Seymour Cassel, Gary Busey, Frederic Forrest and Marilu Henner. Even director Dennis Hopper pops up in multiple roles! So, not a good movie but the acting is on target, there are funny moments and it has female AND male nudity. A pleasant time waster.

    ... so I thought I'd throw in a few words about William McNamara. Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities -- it's obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them -- or less. There's an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies. There's a nice bit where he has to chase after Miss Eleniak in the buff, with only his hands cupped over his groin. William McNamara is naturally a little on the skinny side, but he has a nice, generous handful of a booty. Also, there's a moment when he's getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada. If you're inclined to do so, and come on, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about Navy men on a "road trip" are. I'd just like thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity. Can William McNamara act? Heck if I know.

    The movie is not that bad if you are a fan of Erika Eleniak. Just to see her made my day. So if you think like me, is worth watching it. Tom Berenger a veteran navy officer assigned to escort young and beautiful Erika Eleniak on her way to base brig for assault and going AWOL. William McNamara, a navy officer? to help Tom on his tough commission aka duty. She tries to escape a few times "to no avail", then her master mind goes after William slaved already of her charms (and we get to watch the whole thing) Will she get away with it? Well you will just have to watch for yourself; no spoilers allowed or... Good actors in this movie even if they don't have to try hard on their play and ... by the way, this is an R rated movie in the U.S.A. Again, is worth watching.

    If you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor, then you will enjoy this flick. I don't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy this one. Take it for what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh. It ain't Shakespeare, but it is well done. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one - Better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows a knack for subtle humor. Too bad she hasn't had many opportunities to expand on that. Tom Berenger fits his role of "real Navy" perfectly and William McNamara does a solid job as a hustler. Throw in a walk-on by Hopper in the middle of the chase for "the Cherry on this Sundae" and you've got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing. I bought this one as soon as it was available. Brain-candy.

    Chasers is billed as a comedy-which would be fine-if it were a comedy.in reality it's more like a drama/slash action film with some humour sparsely sprinkled here and there.very sparsely sprinkled.it is mildly entertaining,but not worth watching more than once-at least for a long time.that says a lot,considering the fact that Erica Eleniak is in it.alas even she cannot elevate this movie to anything beyond average.Dennis Hopper directed this movie-why i'm not sure.yes there is some action and Hopper himself has a completely ridiculous and pointless cameo.if you have nothing better to do,you could use up 101 minutes of your life on this movie.it's not the worst movie you've seen or will see.but it is ,put simply-blah.in other words a completely forgettable movie. 5 * because of Erica

    Navy officials Berenger and McNamara are assigned to escort prisoner Eliniak to start serving time but their trip doesn't go all that smoothly. Despite the presence of the terribly annoying William McNamara, Chasers is really an O.K. way to spend less than two hours. Obviously it's not as good as 1973's The Last Detail but it has it's moments. Tom Berenger and Erika Eliniak compensate for McNamara and deliver good performances but the array of good cameos are sorely misused. Gary Busey and Crispin Glover provide a few chuckles but Dennis Hopper, Dean Stockwell and Marilu Henner have nothing to do here. Still, if you're in a forgiving frame of mind and keep your expectations low this film quite alright.

    Is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works by now, pretty woman is introduced in to a picture, someone has to fall in love with her. I think this film does follow some typical story lines, but that doesn't say anything about the content. There are great scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Busey, although short. Some things didn't make sense, such as the need to get in to random fights, but it is entertaining to watch, the fights were actually well done. This is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it. The humor is well balanced, you won't hurt your stomach on this, but you will keep a smile. There is a little bit of steamy action, so not one for the kids.
