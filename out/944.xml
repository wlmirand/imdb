    Penny Marshall supplies yet another average movie in a filmography strewn with them (Big being the exception) but it's certainly far from the worst thing you could watch, even if it is a little overlong. Danny DeVito plays the failed ad exec (and failed husband, failing father . . . . general failure) who is eventually given a new job after some time claiming unemployment benefits. The snag is that his new job is on a military base, educating young soldiers who are lacking in some areas of basic comprehension (who call themselves the "double Ds" meaning dumb as dogs*-**). As he struggles to find a way to connect with them and actually teach them he also tries to sort his own life out, which includes lining up a new job. Of course, we all know that what he really needs to do is concentrate on his job in hand and also learn from the kids as much as they learn from him. Oh yes. So far so Dead Poet's Society/Dangerous Minds and the film never strays too far from that template. It's all about learning from each other, appreciating the differences as much as the similarities and . . . Hamlet. DeVito is good in the lead role, providing his usual mix of seriousness and smart-ass sass. The kids are all okay too (to pick a few examples, Lillo Brancato is as great as ever, Wahlberg does fine and the lovely Stacey Dash is lovely once again) but their characters are all typical archetypes such as the trailer-trash boy, the girl escaping her troubled youth, the smartmouth, the . . . . narcoleptic, etc. Thankfully, things are picked up by the adult characters on screen. The ever-watchable James Remar is eminently watchable once again and just superb while Gregory Hines plays a decent hardass who really has the best interests of his kids at heart. There ARE a few decent twists in here that you might not expect but, overall, it's business as usual for this type of movie and you're not going to see anything you haven't seen before. Comfort food for the masses, which can be quite bland at times if you're trying to please everyone. See this if you like: Dead Poet's Society, Dangerous Minds, Danny DeVito.

    Movies with story about one teacher/one messenger are so many. I think it got no certain time to flourish or to be a common fashion. As the cinematic and the TV movies have to deal with the matter of one-loyal-messenger-whom-sent-to-rectify- young-underachievers quite yearly, maybe because it's a forever catchy touching subject, maybe because education still an exploding case in the USA, or maybe for both reasons. In a school, a playground, or in the army, the story is all one. And the great thing about it is not that it works every time but that it has a messenger who's teaching and studying at the same time, to change and be changed also. Here..(DeVito) at his best, it's a nice polished atmosphere, tranquil rhythm, smooth photography, and great soundtrack that summarized the personality of the movie as a very simple sweet one. However it doesn't utilize a lot of what it brings up, or characters it presents. The drama wasn't hot whereas the alterations have been perfected so easily, for instance : (Gregory Sporleder) as Pvt. Melvin, a unique invalid character that beats his family problems and frustrations by sleeping, became suddenly one smart student at the end who understands Shakespeare brilliantly ! You'd find a misused character and I mean for sure (Gregory Hines)'s, I didn't just grasp what was the need of his character Sergeant Cass ?!, simply he could be a part of the duel as the one who, one way or another, hampers the mission of the hero, or maybe the one who represents the violent side of the military whom excessively may be unable to see the meaning of this mission in the first place. Actually the final result was that yet in so idiot way !, (Hines) was totally wasted in scenes where he looked so kind and supporting at the physical drills !. So when (Hines) listens to the Shakespearean monologue to turn into more soft person, more estimator for (DeVito)'s efforts you have to ask yourself what he was turning from basically ! And to tell you the truth according to all what we saw till this moment, (DeVito) was the one who needs to show more respect to (Hines), he was the wrong one with him not the other way around. Making that Sergeant that mild from the very start weakened it, along with the duel, and made his alteration, if there is any, kind of naive. As for the dialogue I felt bad while the scene of the students read "why I joined the army" whereas they were all poets, and so eloquent. Or correctly speaking in the same eloquent poetic way ! I didn't like the whole scene of (DeVito)'s descending the wall. It wasn't to demonstrate how further that teacher may go to apologize to his students, but to have a scene which (Danny DeVito) the short fat guy hanging over a long sharp vertical board. It was absurd and fabricated. ..Speaking of which, how all the military forgot about honoring a formal hero of it (the father of the neat private) ?, to have that sentimental scene at the end with the fatherly teary eyes (Cliff Robertson) decorates the young man. In fact this is a rare time not to condemn the "System" in a one teacher/one messenger's movie ! I think that writer (Jim Burnstein) with director (Penny Marshall) wanted nothing but a fine dream out of so dark subject, to show it in plainly lovely way (more than discuss it openly and deeply) through that small world which's close to bonbon where Shakespeare solves everything ! Despite all of that, it is optimistic movie that makes you love to watch it, to give you hope that Renaissance is not an impossible thing to achieve, and Hamlet can be a wonderful rap song after all. So it is simple and sweet before being weak at parts.

    One of the most moving experiences in cinema I had during the Nineties was watching Renaissance Man. It's more than a comedy about underachievers realizing their potential. It's about the man who makes them realize their worth as human beings getting quite an education about life himself. Danny DeVito is that man in a role about as far removed as you can get from Louis DePalma in Taxi and Lawrence Garfield in Other People's Money. He's an advertising man who loses a couple of big clients while getting stuck in traffic and gets bounced from his job. Needing an income while looking for a job, the Michigan Unemployment Department gives him an interesting job, a civilian remedial education teacher for the United States Army. He's assigned to a class of eight trainees who might wash out if they don't shape up. It's their mental attitudes that need adjusting. A little trial and error and DeVito hits upon the idea to use Shakespeare, specifically Hamlet as a teaching tool. Interpreting and learning life's lesson from one of the greatest works of literature in the English language apparently works and in ways far beyond making these trainees get through basic training. This is my favorite film with Danny DeVito and he's not an easy fit into army life. Cliff Robertson, James Remar, and Gregory Hines are some of the army people he deals with. But the eight trainees are the heart of the film. Mark Wahlberg, Lillo Brancato, Kadeem Hardison, Richard Jones, Khalil Kain, Gregory Sporleto, Stacey Dash are seven of them. One of them doesn't make it through and ironically because of an act of kindness. But my favorite in the film is Peter Simmons who plays Private Brian Davis from Grand Forks, North Dakota. It's young men like him and his father before him in Vietnam who was killed in action who keep this country safe and secure. He gets the best recognition possible at the end of the film and you are guaranteed not to have a dry eye when you see it. Renaissance Man is a beautifully crafted film from Penny Marshall and should not be missed when broadcast.

    While trite in some ways, this is still a very enjoyable movie. The relationship between the teacher and the drill sergeant is wonderful, and Danny DeVito is great. While the ending is predictable, the misfits DeVito is tasked with teaching are a terrific mix of characters. I can watch this movie over and over for one scene, the speech by the kind of nerdy soldier who gives the sergeant the "We few, we band of brothers" speech. His movement during the speech as he switches from a "soldier in the rain" to an actor reciting Shakespeare is hilarious. And Danny Devito climbing the tower is priceless. Watch the movie.

    Renaissance Man is directed by Penny Marshall and stars Danny DeVito, Gregory Hines, James Remar, Mark Wahlberg, Stacey Dash and Kadeem Hardison. Hans Zimmer scores the film and it's written by Jim Burnstein. The story sees DeVito as Bill Rago, a divorced advertising executive who loses his job and finds himself unemployed. Not only that, but the relationship with his daughter has started to feel the financial strain. However, the unemployment agency find him a short time position at U.S. Army training base, Fort McClane. The position entails him to teach basic comprehension to a class of academic under achievers. Initially he's not enthused by the job, nor are the class particularly responsive to his civilian status. But just maybe this odd coupling may turn out to be good for both parties? That is if Drill Sergeant Cass (Hines) lets them that is? A box office flop that was first marketed as a comedy, then as a drama {it's very much both}, Renaissance Man holds no surprises what so ever. The formula remains the same as every other piece featuring a teacher and an unruly/troubled/under educated class. So with that in mind, and considering the film has largely been kicked by the professional critics, I'm not here to sell this movie to anyone, because sometimes you have to acknowledge that a film can hit a spot of your own personal psyche, yet at the same time be a million miles away from someone else's. The choices we make dictate the life we lead For me personally, Renaissance Man is one such film. It was one dark rainy night back in the mid 90s and I had the blues, I popped over to the video store to see what was available, I couldn't find anything that remotely sounded like something to lift me out of the stupor I was in. I then spied a copy of Renaissance Man, a film I hadn't heard anything about, and although I took that as a bad sign, Danny DeVito's beaming smile on the cover of the box lured me in. I was thinking how much I had enjoyed him in Twins at the back end of 1988, so to me it didn't seem such a bad gamble to take. I was expecting a comedy and I got one, but the bonus was that what I also got was a very uplifting dramatic tale about the human condition, people learning from each other, a tale that shows the power of artistry and how it can unite and lift people. A tale that shows that maybe some folk aren't as clever as others, but if they can grasp a straw and be all that they can be, then their heads will be well and truly held up high. Renaissance Man, I believe, is a sadly undervalued film on this, or any other film related site. But that's just me, because hey! We all got different psyche's right. Right? 8/10

    Halt thyself, thou knave. I shall tell thee of a film in which a great thespian of our time plays a man who teacheth a group of milit'ry people about one of the greatest playwrights of all time. Never have these men and wenches known such masterful work, but eager they are to learn. OK, I'll cut the Shakespearean talk. But the point is that "Renaissance Man" is a really cool movie, with Danny DeVito as a literature teacher who joins the army and teaches some of the recruits about Shakespeare. This was certainly one of the under-appreciated comedies of the 1990s (specifically, one showing that you don't need scatological humor to make a good comedy). At the very least, it should be interesting to see Mark Wahlberg in his film debut. But even beyond that, I would say that there's lots to admire here. I definitely recommend it. Also starring Kadeem Hardison and Cliff Robertson.

    Renaissance Man stands out in my memory as one of those very few movies that lingers throughout the years, inspirational as well as entertaining. I cannot understand why it wasn't a box office hit worldwide! Its message transcends cultures and times (although not entirely transcends literature, thanks to the Shakespeare link). Even there the message is strong - losers can win if they're given encouragement and a challenge. It's a timeless message, and it's true. Add to that Mr. de Vito's hidden talent as a reluctant yet innovative teacher who makes the grade differently, and you have - together with the classic theme of everyone being an individual,yet with an identical need for appreciation - a winning plot. But there's more. It's(looking back now) a star studded cast also! Mark Wahlberg made his debut in this movie, and if you look, today you'll see other notables as well, younger. This is a movie in which the author, director, casting director, cameraman, actors - oh heck, the entire crew - excel as a team. The whole is superbly a multiplication of its parts. It deserves to be watched every year or so, if only to be reminded of the empathetic message. I marvel at how the author came up with this story, which keeps showing more insight as it meanders through the experiment of a failed advertising man having to teach in the US Army just to keep alive. It's fun, encouraging and clever. The plot and its subplots are captivating, the actors convincing, and right at the end kindness and heroism win out - convincingly. I often recall an unforgettable line delivered by de Vito, and the context in which he says it: "The choices you make dictate the life you will lead." Upbeat, funny, touching and inspirational. Could Shakespeare have done better? I doubt it. Definitely a classic.

    This is one of those movies that, while not a blockbuster, is well-written and executed adequately. The story is a fine example of instilling a sense of self-confidence in a group of people that have grown up thinking they were deficient in some way, only to discover that they have the same abilities as everyone else. It's not the sort of movie I'd go see in a theater, but is one that I like to watch from time to time. The 8 ranking is exclusively for the concept, and surely not for the acting. Danny DeVito is clearly the best portrayed character in that regard, however. Gregory Hines gives his character an extreme over-the-top feel that is more accurately associated with Marine Corps Drill Instructors than Army Drill Sergeants. It doesn't work very well with the more laid-back atmosphere of Army training.

    This is a feel good movie, not very deep BUT well conceived, written and acted. DeVito is excellent as a failing marketing man being transformed into a thoughtful, caring army educator. As important is the film's excellent presentation and discussion of the works of Shakespeare. No surprise, DeVito's self centered abrasiveness meets with antipathy. Army officers don't care. Convinced of their own worthlessness, DeVito's students are disinterested, at best. During the semester, DeVito, mellows, students learn enough to advance,and Army brass begins to appreciates the new teacher. The best part of this film is not DeVito's or the student's redemption but the film's beguiling Shakespeare presentation. DeVito teaches the Bard with passion. The writers deliver illuminating, focused student dialog. As one who didn't "get" Shakespeare until seeing MacBeth a year after graduation. This movie was a better class than anything I took in high school or college. Enjoy the film and the class.

    The older I get the more I realize how this movie is a little cheesy, But if you really like a feel good movie you can't go wrong with this one. Danny Devito did a wonderful job playing a teacher in the army.(a job he didn't ask for and is not looking forward to)He is brought in to teach these kids that everyone thinks are stupid. Every one of the characters left an impression in my mind. They all did a wonderful job at playing their roles.Each one of the student's are different and everyone knows someone in real life like each one of them. It is a little like dead poet's society but with more comedy and a more "happy good feeling" I am always in a GREAT mood at the end of this movie!

So with that in mind, and considering the film has largely been kicked by the professional critics, I'm not here to sell this movie to anyone, because sometimes you have to acknowledge that a film can hit a spot of your own personal psyche, yet at the same time be a million miles away from someone else's. The choices we make dictate the life we lead For me personally, Renaissance Man is one such film. It was one dark rainy night back in the mid 90s and I had the blues, I popped over to the video store to see what was available, I couldn't find anything that remotely sounded like something to lift me out of the stupor I was in. I then spied a copy of Renaissance Man, a film I hadn't heard anything about, and although I took that as a bad sign, Danny DeVito's beaming smile on the cover of the box lured me in. I was thinking how much I had enjoyed him in Twins at the back end of 1988, so to me it didn't seem such a bad gamble to take. I was expecting a comedy and I got one, but the bonus was that what I also got was a very uplifting dramatic tale about the human condition, people learning from each other, a tale that shows the power of artistry and how it can unite and lift people. A tale that shows that maybe some folk aren't as clever as others, but if they can grasp a straw and be all that they can be, then their heads will be well and truly held up high. Renaissance Man, I believe, is a sadly undervalued film on this, or any other film related site. But that's just me, because hey! We all got different psyche's right. Right? 8/10

    Halt thyself, thou knave. I shall tell thee of a film in which a great thespian of our time plays a man who teacheth a group of milit'ry people about one of the greatest playwrights of all time. Never have these men and wenches known such masterful work, but eager they are to learn. OK, I'll cut the Shakespearean talk. But the point is that "Renaissance Man" is a really cool movie, with Danny DeVito as a literature teacher who joins the army and teaches some of the recruits about Shakespeare. This was certainly one of the under-appreciated comedies of the 1990s (specifically, one showing that you don't need scatological humor to make a good comedy). At the very least, it should be interesting to see Mark Wahlberg in his film debut. But even beyond that, I would say that there's lots to admire here. I definitely recommend it. Also starring Kadeem Hardison and Cliff Robertson.

    Renaissance Man stands out in my memory as one of those very few movies that lingers throughout the years, inspirational as well as entertaining. I cannot understand why it wasn't a box office hit worldwide! Its message transcends cultures and times (although not entirely transcends literature, thanks to the Shakespeare link). Even there the message is strong - losers can win if they're given encouragement and a challenge. It's a timeless message, and it's true. Add to that Mr. de Vito's hidden talent as a reluctant yet innovative teacher who makes the grade differently, and you have - together with the classic theme of everyone being an individual,yet with an identical need for appreciation - a winning plot. But there's more. It's(looking back now) a star studded cast also! Mark Wahlberg made his debut in this movie, and if you look, today you'll see other notables as well, younger. This is a movie in which the author, director, casting director, cameraman, actors - oh heck, the entire crew - excel as a team. The whole is superbly a multiplication of its parts. It deserves to be watched every year or so, if only to be reminded of the empathetic message. I marvel at how the author came up with this story, which keeps showing more insight as it meanders through the experiment of a failed advertising man having to teach in the US Army just to keep alive. It's fun, encouraging and clever. The plot and its subplots are captivating, the actors convincing, and right at the end kindness and heroism win out - convincingly. I often recall an unforgettable line delivered by de Vito, and the context in which he says it: "The choices you make dictate the life you will lead." Upbeat, funny, touching and inspirational. Could Shakespeare have done better? I doubt it. Definitely a classic.

    This is one of those movies that, while not a blockbuster, is well-written and executed adequately. The story is a fine example of instilling a sense of self-confidence in a group of people that have grown up thinking they were deficient in some way, only to discover that they have the same abilities as everyone else. It's not the sort of movie I'd go see in a theater, but is one that I like to watch from time to time. The 8 ranking is exclusively for the concept, and surely not for the acting. Danny DeVito is clearly the best portrayed character in that regard, however. Gregory Hines gives his character an extreme over-the-top feel that is more accurately associated with Marine Corps Drill Instructors than Army Drill Sergeants. It doesn't work very well with the more laid-back atmosphere of Army training.

    This is a feel good movie, not very deep BUT well conceived, written and acted. DeVito is excellent as a failing marketing man being transformed into a thoughtful, caring army educator. As important is the film's excellent presentation and discussion of the works of Shakespeare. No surprise, DeVito's self centered abrasiveness meets with antipathy. Army officers don't care. Convinced of their own worthlessness, DeVito's students are disinterested, at best. During the semester, DeVito, mellows, students learn enough to advance,and Army brass begins to appreciates the new teacher. The best part of this film is not DeVito's or the student's redemption but the film's beguiling Shakespeare presentation. DeVito teaches the Bard with passion. The writers deliver illuminating, focused student dialog. As one who didn't "get" Shakespeare until seeing MacBeth a year after graduation. This movie was a better class than anything I took in high school or college. Enjoy the film and the class.

    The older I get the more I realize how this movie is a little cheesy, But if you really like a feel good movie you can't go wrong with this one. Danny Devito did a wonderful job playing a teacher in the army.(a job he didn't ask for and is not looking forward to)He is brought in to teach these kids that everyone thinks are stupid. Every one of the characters left an impression in my mind. They all did a wonderful job at playing their roles.Each one of the student's are different and everyone knows someone in real life like each one of them. It is a little like dead poet's society but with more comedy and a more "happy good feeling" I am always in a GREAT mood at the end of this movie!

    Penny Marshall supplies yet another average movie in a filmography strewn with them (Big being the exception) but it's certainly far from the worst thing you could watch, even if it is a little overlong. Danny DeVito plays the failed ad exec (and failed husband, failing father . . . . general failure) who is eventually given a new job after some time claiming unemployment benefits. The snag is that his new job is on a military base, educating young soldiers who are lacking in some areas of basic comprehension (who call themselves the "double Ds" meaning dumb as dogs*-**). As he struggles to find a way to connect with them and actually teach them he also tries to sort his own life out, which includes lining up a new job. Of course, we all know that what he really needs to do is concentrate on his job in hand and also learn from the kids as much as they learn from him. Oh yes. So far so Dead Poet's Society/Dangerous Minds and the film never strays too far from that template. It's all about learning from each other, appreciating the differences as much as the similarities and . . . Hamlet. DeVito is good in the lead role, providing his usual mix of seriousness and smart-ass sass. The kids are all okay too (to pick a few examples, Lillo Brancato is as great as ever, Wahlberg does fine and the lovely Stacey Dash is lovely once again) but their characters are all typical archetypes such as the trailer-trash boy, the girl escaping her troubled youth, the smartmouth, the . . . . narcoleptic, etc. Thankfully, things are picked up by the adult characters on screen. The ever-watchable James Remar is eminently watchable once again and just superb while Gregory Hines plays a decent hardass who really has the best interests of his kids at heart. There ARE a few decent twists in here that you might not expect but, overall, it's business as usual for this type of movie and you're not going to see anything you haven't seen before. Comfort food for the masses, which can be quite bland at times if you're trying to please everyone. See this if you like: Dead Poet's Society, Dangerous Minds, Danny DeVito.

    Movies with story about one teacher/one messenger are so many. I think it got no certain time to flourish or to be a common fashion. As the cinematic and the TV movies have to deal with the matter of one-loyal-messenger-whom-sent-to-rectify- young-underachievers quite yearly, maybe because it's a forever catchy touching subject, maybe because education still an exploding case in the USA, or maybe for both reasons. In a school, a playground, or in the army, the story is all one. And the great thing about it is not that it works every time but that it has a messenger who's teaching and studying at the same time, to change and be changed also. Here..(DeVito) at his best, it's a nice polished atmosphere, tranquil rhythm, smooth photography, and great soundtrack that summarized the personality of the movie as a very simple sweet one. However it doesn't utilize a lot of what it brings up, or characters it presents. The drama wasn't hot whereas the alterations have been perfected so easily, for instance : (Gregory Sporleder) as Pvt. Melvin, a unique invalid character that beats his family problems and frustrations by sleeping, became suddenly one smart student at the end who understands Shakespeare brilliantly ! You'd find a misused character and I mean for sure (Gregory Hines)'s, I didn't just grasp what was the need of his character Sergeant Cass ?!, simply he could be a part of the duel as the one who, one way or another, hampers the mission of the hero, or maybe the one who represents the violent side of the military whom excessively may be unable to see the meaning of this mission in the first place. Actually the final result was that yet in so idiot way !, (Hines) was totally wasted in scenes where he looked so kind and supporting at the physical drills !. So when (Hines) listens to the Shakespearean monologue to turn into more soft person, more estimator for (DeVito)'s efforts you have to ask yourself what he was turning from basically ! And to tell you the truth according to all what we saw till this moment, (DeVito) was the one who needs to show more respect to (Hines), he was the wrong one with him not the other way around. Making that Sergeant that mild from the very start weakened it, along with the duel, and made his alteration, if there is any, kind of naive. As for the dialogue I felt bad while the scene of the students read "why I joined the army" whereas they were all poets, and so eloquent. Or correctly speaking in the same eloquent poetic way ! I didn't like the whole scene of (DeVito)'s descending the wall. It wasn't to demonstrate how further that teacher may go to apologize to his students, but to have a scene which (Danny DeVito) the short fat guy hanging over a long sharp vertical board. It was absurd and fabricated. ..Speaking of which, how all the military forgot about honoring a formal hero of it (the father of the neat private) ?, to have that sentimental scene at the end with the fatherly teary eyes (Cliff Robertson) decorates the young man. In fact this is a rare time not to condemn the "System" in a one teacher/one messenger's movie ! I think that writer (Jim Burnstein) with director (Penny Marshall) wanted nothing but a fine dream out of so dark subject, to show it in plainly lovely way (more than discuss it openly and deeply) through that small world which's close to bonbon where Shakespeare solves everything ! Despite all of that, it is optimistic movie that makes you love to watch it, to give you hope that Renaissance is not an impossible thing to achieve, and Hamlet can be a wonderful rap song after all. So it is simple and sweet before being weak at parts.

    One of the most moving experiences in cinema I had during the Nineties was watching Renaissance Man. It's more than a comedy about underachievers realizing their potential. It's about the man who makes them realize their worth as human beings getting quite an education about life himself. Danny DeVito is that man in a role about as far removed as you can get from Louis DePalma in Taxi and Lawrence Garfield in Other People's Money. He's an advertising man who loses a couple of big clients while getting stuck in traffic and gets bounced from his job. Needing an income while looking for a job, the Michigan Unemployment Department gives him an interesting job, a civilian remedial education teacher for the United States Army. He's assigned to a class of eight trainees who might wash out if they don't shape up. It's their mental attitudes that need adjusting. A little trial and error and DeVito hits upon the idea to use Shakespeare, specifically Hamlet as a teaching tool. Interpreting and learning life's lesson from one of the greatest works of literature in the English language apparently works and in ways far beyond making these trainees get through basic training. This is my favorite film with Danny DeVito and he's not an easy fit into army life. Cliff Robertson, James Remar, and Gregory Hines are some of the army people he deals with. But the eight trainees are the heart of the film. Mark Wahlberg, Lillo Brancato, Kadeem Hardison, Richard Jones, Khalil Kain, Gregory Sporleto, Stacey Dash are seven of them. One of them doesn't make it through and ironically because of an act of kindness. But my favorite in the film is Peter Simmons who plays Private Brian Davis from Grand Forks, North Dakota. It's young men like him and his father before him in Vietnam who was killed in action who keep this country safe and secure. He gets the best recognition possible at the end of the film and you are guaranteed not to have a dry eye when you see it. Renaissance Man is a beautifully crafted film from Penny Marshall and should not be missed when broadcast.

    While trite in some ways, this is still a very enjoyable movie. The relationship between the teacher and the drill sergeant is wonderful, and Danny DeVito is great. While the ending is predictable, the misfits DeVito is tasked with teaching are a terrific mix of characters. I can watch this movie over and over for one scene, the speech by the kind of nerdy soldier who gives the sergeant the "We few, we band of brothers" speech. His movement during the speech as he switches from a "soldier in the rain" to an actor reciting Shakespeare is hilarious. And Danny Devito climbing the tower is priceless. Watch the movie.

    Renaissance Man is directed by Penny Marshall and stars Danny DeVito, Gregory Hines, James Remar, Mark Wahlberg, Stacey Dash and Kadeem Hardison. Hans Zimmer scores the film and it's written by Jim Burnstein. The story sees DeVito as Bill Rago, a divorced advertising executive who loses his job and finds himself unemployed. Not only that, but the relationship with his daughter has started to feel the financial strain. However, the unemployment agency find him a short time position at U.S. Army training base, Fort McClane. The position entails him to teach basic comprehension to a class of academic under achievers. Initially he's not enthused by the job, nor are the class particularly responsive to his civilian status. But just maybe this odd coupling may turn out to be good for both parties? That is if Drill Sergeant Cass (Hines) lets them that is? A box office flop that was first marketed as a comedy, then as a drama {it's very much both}, Renaissance Man holds no surprises what so ever. The formula remains the same as every other piece featuring a teacher and an unruly/troubled/under educated class.

Actually the final result was that yet in so idiot way !, (Hines) was totally wasted in scenes where he looked so kind and supporting at the physical drills !. So when (Hines) listens to the Shakespearean monologue to turn into more soft person, more estimator for (DeVito)'s efforts you have to ask yourself what he was turning from basically ! And to tell you the truth according to all what we saw till this moment, (DeVito) was the one who needs to show more respect to (Hines), he was the wrong one with him not the other way around. Making that Sergeant that mild from the very start weakened it, along with the duel, and made his alteration, if there is any, kind of naive. As for the dialogue I felt bad while the scene of the students read "why I joined the army" whereas they were all poets, and so eloquent. Or correctly speaking in the same eloquent poetic way ! I didn't like the whole scene of (DeVito)'s descending the wall. It wasn't to demonstrate how further that teacher may go to apologize to his students, but to have a scene which (Danny DeVito) the short fat guy hanging over a long sharp vertical board. It was absurd and fabricated. ..Speaking of which, how all the military forgot about honoring a formal hero of it (the father of the neat private) ?, to have that sentimental scene at the end with the fatherly teary eyes (Cliff Robertson) decorates the young man. In fact this is a rare time not to condemn the "System" in a one teacher/one messenger's movie ! I think that writer (Jim Burnstein) with director (Penny Marshall) wanted nothing but a fine dream out of so dark subject, to show it in plainly lovely way (more than discuss it openly and deeply) through that small world which's close to bonbon where Shakespeare solves everything ! Despite all of that, it is optimistic movie that makes you love to watch it, to give you hope that Renaissance is not an impossible thing to achieve, and Hamlet can be a wonderful rap song after all. So it is simple and sweet before being weak at parts.

    One of the most moving experiences in cinema I had during the Nineties was watching Renaissance Man. It's more than a comedy about underachievers realizing their potential. It's about the man who makes them realize their worth as human beings getting quite an education about life himself. Danny DeVito is that man in a role about as far removed as you can get from Louis DePalma in Taxi and Lawrence Garfield in Other People's Money. He's an advertising man who loses a couple of big clients while getting stuck in traffic and gets bounced from his job. Needing an income while looking for a job, the Michigan Unemployment Department gives him an interesting job, a civilian remedial education teacher for the United States Army. He's assigned to a class of eight trainees who might wash out if they don't shape up. It's their mental attitudes that need adjusting. A little trial and error and DeVito hits upon the idea to use Shakespeare, specifically Hamlet as a teaching tool. Interpreting and learning life's lesson from one of the greatest works of literature in the English language apparently works and in ways far beyond making these trainees get through basic training. This is my favorite film with Danny DeVito and he's not an easy fit into army life. Cliff Robertson, James Remar, and Gregory Hines are some of the army people he deals with. But the eight trainees are the heart of the film. Mark Wahlberg, Lillo Brancato, Kadeem Hardison, Richard Jones, Khalil Kain, Gregory Sporleto, Stacey Dash are seven of them. One of them doesn't make it through and ironically because of an act of kindness. But my favorite in the film is Peter Simmons who plays Private Brian Davis from Grand Forks, North Dakota. It's young men like him and his father before him in Vietnam who was killed in action who keep this country safe and secure. He gets the best recognition possible at the end of the film and you are guaranteed not to have a dry eye when you see it. Renaissance Man is a beautifully crafted film from Penny Marshall and should not be missed when broadcast.

    While trite in some ways, this is still a very enjoyable movie. The relationship between the teacher and the drill sergeant is wonderful, and Danny DeVito is great. While the ending is predictable, the misfits DeVito is tasked with teaching are a terrific mix of characters. I can watch this movie over and over for one scene, the speech by the kind of nerdy soldier who gives the sergeant the "We few, we band of brothers" speech. His movement during the speech as he switches from a "soldier in the rain" to an actor reciting Shakespeare is hilarious. And Danny Devito climbing the tower is priceless. Watch the movie.

    Renaissance Man is directed by Penny Marshall and stars Danny DeVito, Gregory Hines, James Remar, Mark Wahlberg, Stacey Dash and Kadeem Hardison. Hans Zimmer scores the film and it's written by Jim Burnstein. The story sees DeVito as Bill Rago, a divorced advertising executive who loses his job and finds himself unemployed. Not only that, but the relationship with his daughter has started to feel the financial strain. However, the unemployment agency find him a short time position at U.S. Army training base, Fort McClane. The position entails him to teach basic comprehension to a class of academic under achievers. Initially he's not enthused by the job, nor are the class particularly responsive to his civilian status. But just maybe this odd coupling may turn out to be good for both parties? That is if Drill Sergeant Cass (Hines) lets them that is? A box office flop that was first marketed as a comedy, then as a drama {it's very much both}, Renaissance Man holds no surprises what so ever. The formula remains the same as every other piece featuring a teacher and an unruly/troubled/under educated class. So with that in mind, and considering the film has largely been kicked by the professional critics, I'm not here to sell this movie to anyone, because sometimes you have to acknowledge that a film can hit a spot of your own personal psyche, yet at the same time be a million miles away from someone else's. The choices we make dictate the life we lead For me personally, Renaissance Man is one such film. It was one dark rainy night back in the mid 90s and I had the blues, I popped over to the video store to see what was available, I couldn't find anything that remotely sounded like something to lift me out of the stupor I was in. I then spied a copy of Renaissance Man, a film I hadn't heard anything about, and although I took that as a bad sign, Danny DeVito's beaming smile on the cover of the box lured me in. I was thinking how much I had enjoyed him in Twins at the back end of 1988, so to me it didn't seem such a bad gamble to take. I was expecting a comedy and I got one, but the bonus was that what I also got was a very uplifting dramatic tale about the human condition, people learning from each other, a tale that shows the power of artistry and how it can unite and lift people. A tale that shows that maybe some folk aren't as clever as others, but if they can grasp a straw and be all that they can be, then their heads will be well and truly held up high. Renaissance Man, I believe, is a sadly undervalued film on this, or any other film related site. But that's just me, because hey! We all got different psyche's right. Right? 8/10

    Halt thyself, thou knave. I shall tell thee of a film in which a great thespian of our time plays a man who teacheth a group of milit'ry people about one of the greatest playwrights of all time. Never have these men and wenches known such masterful work, but eager they are to learn. OK, I'll cut the Shakespearean talk. But the point is that "Renaissance Man" is a really cool movie, with Danny DeVito as a literature teacher who joins the army and teaches some of the recruits about Shakespeare. This was certainly one of the under-appreciated comedies of the 1990s (specifically, one showing that you don't need scatological humor to make a good comedy). At the very least, it should be interesting to see Mark Wahlberg in his film debut. But even beyond that, I would say that there's lots to admire here. I definitely recommend it. Also starring Kadeem Hardison and Cliff Robertson.

    Renaissance Man stands out in my memory as one of those very few movies that lingers throughout the years, inspirational as well as entertaining. I cannot understand why it wasn't a box office hit worldwide! Its message transcends cultures and times (although not entirely transcends literature, thanks to the Shakespeare link). Even there the message is strong - losers can win if they're given encouragement and a challenge. It's a timeless message, and it's true. Add to that Mr. de Vito's hidden talent as a reluctant yet innovative teacher who makes the grade differently, and you have - together with the classic theme of everyone being an individual,yet with an identical need for appreciation - a winning plot. But there's more. It's(looking back now) a star studded cast also! Mark Wahlberg made his debut in this movie, and if you look, today you'll see other notables as well, younger. This is a movie in which the author, director, casting director, cameraman, actors - oh heck, the entire crew - excel as a team. The whole is superbly a multiplication of its parts. It deserves to be watched every year or so, if only to be reminded of the empathetic message. I marvel at how the author came up with this story, which keeps showing more insight as it meanders through the experiment of a failed advertising man having to teach in the US Army just to keep alive. It's fun, encouraging and clever. The plot and its subplots are captivating, the actors convincing, and right at the end kindness and heroism win out - convincingly. I often recall an unforgettable line delivered by de Vito, and the context in which he says it: "The choices you make dictate the life you will lead." Upbeat, funny, touching and inspirational. Could Shakespeare have done better? I doubt it. Definitely a classic.

    This is one of those movies that, while not a blockbuster, is well-written and executed adequately. The story is a fine example of instilling a sense of self-confidence in a group of people that have grown up thinking they were deficient in some way, only to discover that they have the same abilities as everyone else. It's not the sort of movie I'd go see in a theater, but is one that I like to watch from time to time. The 8 ranking is exclusively for the concept, and surely not for the acting. Danny DeVito is clearly the best portrayed character in that regard, however. Gregory Hines gives his character an extreme over-the-top feel that is more accurately associated with Marine Corps Drill Instructors than Army Drill Sergeants. It doesn't work very well with the more laid-back atmosphere of Army training.

    This is a feel good movie, not very deep BUT well conceived, written and acted. DeVito is excellent as a failing marketing man being transformed into a thoughtful, caring army educator. As important is the film's excellent presentation and discussion of the works of Shakespeare. No surprise, DeVito's self centered abrasiveness meets with antipathy. Army officers don't care. Convinced of their own worthlessness, DeVito's students are disinterested, at best. During the semester, DeVito, mellows, students learn enough to advance,and Army brass begins to appreciates the new teacher. The best part of this film is not DeVito's or the student's redemption but the film's beguiling Shakespeare presentation. DeVito teaches the Bard with passion. The writers deliver illuminating, focused student dialog. As one who didn't "get" Shakespeare until seeing MacBeth a year after graduation. This movie was a better class than anything I took in high school or college. Enjoy the film and the class.

    The older I get the more I realize how this movie is a little cheesy, But if you really like a feel good movie you can't go wrong with this one. Danny Devito did a wonderful job playing a teacher in the army.(a job he didn't ask for and is not looking forward to)He is brought in to teach these kids that everyone thinks are stupid. Every one of the characters left an impression in my mind. They all did a wonderful job at playing their roles.Each one of the student's are different and everyone knows someone in real life like each one of them. It is a little like dead poet's society but with more comedy and a more "happy good feeling" I am always in a GREAT mood at the end of this movie!

    Penny Marshall supplies yet another average movie in a filmography strewn with them (Big being the exception) but it's certainly far from the worst thing you could watch, even if it is a little overlong. Danny DeVito plays the failed ad exec (and failed husband, failing father . . . . general failure) who is eventually given a new job after some time claiming unemployment benefits. The snag is that his new job is on a military base, educating young soldiers who are lacking in some areas of basic comprehension (who call themselves the "double Ds" meaning dumb as dogs*-**). As he struggles to find a way to connect with them and actually teach them he also tries to sort his own life out, which includes lining up a new job. Of course, we all know that what he really needs to do is concentrate on his job in hand and also learn from the kids as much as they learn from him. Oh yes. So far so Dead Poet's Society/Dangerous Minds and the film never strays too far from that template. It's all about learning from each other, appreciating the differences as much as the similarities and . . . Hamlet. DeVito is good in the lead role, providing his usual mix of seriousness and smart-ass sass. The kids are all okay too (to pick a few examples, Lillo Brancato is as great as ever, Wahlberg does fine and the lovely Stacey Dash is lovely once again) but their characters are all typical archetypes such as the trailer-trash boy, the girl escaping her troubled youth, the smartmouth, the . . . . narcoleptic, etc. Thankfully, things are picked up by the adult characters on screen. The ever-watchable James Remar is eminently watchable once again and just superb while Gregory Hines plays a decent hardass who really has the best interests of his kids at heart. There ARE a few decent twists in here that you might not expect but, overall, it's business as usual for this type of movie and you're not going to see anything you haven't seen before. Comfort food for the masses, which can be quite bland at times if you're trying to please everyone. See this if you like: Dead Poet's Society, Dangerous Minds, Danny DeVito.

    Movies with story about one teacher/one messenger are so many. I think it got no certain time to flourish or to be a common fashion. As the cinematic and the TV movies have to deal with the matter of one-loyal-messenger-whom-sent-to-rectify- young-underachievers quite yearly, maybe because it's a forever catchy touching subject, maybe because education still an exploding case in the USA, or maybe for both reasons. In a school, a playground, or in the army, the story is all one. And the great thing about it is not that it works every time but that it has a messenger who's teaching and studying at the same time, to change and be changed also. Here..(DeVito) at his best, it's a nice polished atmosphere, tranquil rhythm, smooth photography, and great soundtrack that summarized the personality of the movie as a very simple sweet one. However it doesn't utilize a lot of what it brings up, or characters it presents. The drama wasn't hot whereas the alterations have been perfected so easily, for instance : (Gregory Sporleder) as Pvt. Melvin, a unique invalid character that beats his family problems and frustrations by sleeping, became suddenly one smart student at the end who understands Shakespeare brilliantly ! You'd find a misused character and I mean for sure (Gregory Hines)'s, I didn't just grasp what was the need of his character Sergeant Cass ?!, simply he could be a part of the duel as the one who, one way or another, hampers the mission of the hero, or maybe the one who represents the violent side of the military whom excessively may be unable to see the meaning of this mission in the first place. Actually the final result was that yet in so idiot way !, (Hines) was totally wasted in scenes where he looked so kind and supporting at the physical drills !.

And to tell you the truth according to all what we saw till this moment, (DeVito) was the one who needs to show more respect to (Hines), he was the wrong one with him not the other way around.

    This is a feel good movie, not very deep BUT well conceived, written and acted. DeVito is excellent as a failing marketing man being transformed into a thoughtful, caring army educator. As important is the film's excellent presentation and discussion of the works of Shakespeare. No surprise, DeVito's self centered abrasiveness meets with antipathy. Army officers don't care. Convinced of their own worthlessness, DeVito's students are disinterested, at best. During the semester, DeVito, mellows, students learn enough to advance,and Army brass begins to appreciates the new teacher. The best part of this film is not DeVito's or the student's redemption but the film's beguiling Shakespeare presentation. DeVito teaches the Bard with passion. The writers deliver illuminating, focused student dialog. As one who didn't "get" Shakespeare until seeing MacBeth a year after graduation. This movie was a better class than anything I took in high school or college. Enjoy the film and the class.

    The older I get the more I realize how this movie is a little cheesy, But if you really like a feel good movie you can't go wrong with this one. Danny Devito did a wonderful job playing a teacher in the army.(a job he didn't ask for and is not looking forward to)He is brought in to teach these kids that everyone thinks are stupid. Every one of the characters left an impression in my mind. They all did a wonderful job at playing their roles.Each one of the student's are different and everyone knows someone in real life like each one of them. It is a little like dead poet's society but with more comedy and a more "happy good feeling" I am always in a GREAT mood at the end of this movie!

    Penny Marshall supplies yet another average movie in a filmography strewn with them (Big being the exception) but it's certainly far from the worst thing you could watch, even if it is a little overlong. Danny DeVito plays the failed ad exec (and failed husband, failing father . . . . general failure) who is eventually given a new job after some time claiming unemployment benefits. The snag is that his new job is on a military base, educating young soldiers who are lacking in some areas of basic comprehension (who call themselves the "double Ds" meaning dumb as dogs*-**). As he struggles to find a way to connect with them and actually teach them he also tries to sort his own life out, which includes lining up a new job. Of course, we all know that what he really needs to do is concentrate on his job in hand and also learn from the kids as much as they learn from him. Oh yes. So far so Dead Poet's Society/Dangerous Minds and the film never strays too far from that template. It's all about learning from each other, appreciating the differences as much as the similarities and . . . Hamlet. DeVito is good in the lead role, providing his usual mix of seriousness and smart-ass sass. The kids are all okay too (to pick a few examples, Lillo Brancato is as great as ever, Wahlberg does fine and the lovely Stacey Dash is lovely once again) but their characters are all typical archetypes such as the trailer-trash boy, the girl escaping her troubled youth, the smartmouth, the . . . . narcoleptic, etc. Thankfully, things are picked up by the adult characters on screen. The ever-watchable James Remar is eminently watchable once again and just superb while Gregory Hines plays a decent hardass who really has the best interests of his kids at heart. There ARE a few decent twists in here that you might not expect but, overall, it's business as usual for this type of movie and you're not going to see anything you haven't seen before. Comfort food for the masses, which can be quite bland at times if you're trying to please everyone. See this if you like: Dead Poet's Society, Dangerous Minds, Danny DeVito.

    Movies with story about one teacher/one messenger are so many. I think it got no certain time to flourish or to be a common fashion. As the cinematic and the TV movies have to deal with the matter of one-loyal-messenger-whom-sent-to-rectify- young-underachievers quite yearly, maybe because it's a forever catchy touching subject, maybe because education still an exploding case in the USA, or maybe for both reasons. In a school, a playground, or in the army, the story is all one. And the great thing about it is not that it works every time but that it has a messenger who's teaching and studying at the same time, to change and be changed also. Here..(DeVito) at his best, it's a nice polished atmosphere, tranquil rhythm, smooth photography, and great soundtrack that summarized the personality of the movie as a very simple sweet one. However it doesn't utilize a lot of what it brings up, or characters it presents. The drama wasn't hot whereas the alterations have been perfected so easily, for instance : (Gregory Sporleder) as Pvt. Melvin, a unique invalid character that beats his family problems and frustrations by sleeping, became suddenly one smart student at the end who understands Shakespeare brilliantly ! You'd find a misused character and I mean for sure (Gregory Hines)'s, I didn't just grasp what was the need of his character Sergeant Cass ?!, simply he could be a part of the duel as the one who, one way or another, hampers the mission of the hero, or maybe the one who represents the violent side of the military whom excessively may be unable to see the meaning of this mission in the first place. Actually the final result was that yet in so idiot way !, (Hines) was totally wasted in scenes where he looked so kind and supporting at the physical drills !. So when (Hines) listens to the Shakespearean monologue to turn into more soft person, more estimator for (DeVito)'s efforts you have to ask yourself what he was turning from basically ! And to tell you the truth according to all what we saw till this moment, (DeVito) was the one who needs to show more respect to (Hines), he was the wrong one with him not the other way around. Making that Sergeant that mild from the very start weakened it, along with the duel, and made his alteration, if there is any, kind of naive. As for the dialogue I felt bad while the scene of the students read "why I joined the army" whereas they were all poets, and so eloquent. Or correctly speaking in the same eloquent poetic way ! I didn't like the whole scene of (DeVito)'s descending the wall. It wasn't to demonstrate how further that teacher may go to apologize to his students, but to have a scene which (Danny DeVito) the short fat guy hanging over a long sharp vertical board. It was absurd and fabricated. ..Speaking of which, how all the military forgot about honoring a formal hero of it (the father of the neat private) ?, to have that sentimental scene at the end with the fatherly teary eyes (Cliff Robertson) decorates the young man. In fact this is a rare time not to condemn the "System" in a one teacher/one messenger's movie ! I think that writer (Jim Burnstein) with director (Penny Marshall) wanted nothing but a fine dream out of so dark subject, to show it in plainly lovely way (more than discuss it openly and deeply) through that small world which's close to bonbon where Shakespeare solves everything ! Despite all of that, it is optimistic movie that makes you love to watch it, to give you hope that Renaissance is not an impossible thing to achieve, and Hamlet can be a wonderful rap song after all. So it is simple and sweet before being weak at parts.

    One of the most moving experiences in cinema I had during the Nineties was watching Renaissance Man. It's more than a comedy about underachievers realizing their potential. It's about the man who makes them realize their worth as human beings getting quite an education about life himself. Danny DeVito is that man in a role about as far removed as you can get from Louis DePalma in Taxi and Lawrence Garfield in Other People's Money. He's an advertising man who loses a couple of big clients while getting stuck in traffic and gets bounced from his job. Needing an income while looking for a job, the Michigan Unemployment Department gives him an interesting job, a civilian remedial education teacher for the United States Army. He's assigned to a class of eight trainees who might wash out if they don't shape up. It's their mental attitudes that need adjusting. A little trial and error and DeVito hits upon the idea to use Shakespeare, specifically Hamlet as a teaching tool. Interpreting and learning life's lesson from one of the greatest works of literature in the English language apparently works and in ways far beyond making these trainees get through basic training. This is my favorite film with Danny DeVito and he's not an easy fit into army life. Cliff Robertson, James Remar, and Gregory Hines are some of the army people he deals with. But the eight trainees are the heart of the film. Mark Wahlberg, Lillo Brancato, Kadeem Hardison, Richard Jones, Khalil Kain, Gregory Sporleto, Stacey Dash are seven of them. One of them doesn't make it through and ironically because of an act of kindness. But my favorite in the film is Peter Simmons who plays Private Brian Davis from Grand Forks, North Dakota. It's young men like him and his father before him in Vietnam who was killed in action who keep this country safe and secure. He gets the best recognition possible at the end of the film and you are guaranteed not to have a dry eye when you see it. Renaissance Man is a beautifully crafted film from Penny Marshall and should not be missed when broadcast.

    While trite in some ways, this is still a very enjoyable movie. The relationship between the teacher and the drill sergeant is wonderful, and Danny DeVito is great. While the ending is predictable, the misfits DeVito is tasked with teaching are a terrific mix of characters. I can watch this movie over and over for one scene, the speech by the kind of nerdy soldier who gives the sergeant the "We few, we band of brothers" speech. His movement during the speech as he switches from a "soldier in the rain" to an actor reciting Shakespeare is hilarious. And Danny Devito climbing the tower is priceless. Watch the movie.

    Renaissance Man is directed by Penny Marshall and stars Danny DeVito, Gregory Hines, James Remar, Mark Wahlberg, Stacey Dash and Kadeem Hardison. Hans Zimmer scores the film and it's written by Jim Burnstein. The story sees DeVito as Bill Rago, a divorced advertising executive who loses his job and finds himself unemployed. Not only that, but the relationship with his daughter has started to feel the financial strain. However, the unemployment agency find him a short time position at U.S. Army training base, Fort McClane. The position entails him to teach basic comprehension to a class of academic under achievers. Initially he's not enthused by the job, nor are the class particularly responsive to his civilian status. But just maybe this odd coupling may turn out to be good for both parties? That is if Drill Sergeant Cass (Hines) lets them that is? A box office flop that was first marketed as a comedy, then as a drama {it's very much both}, Renaissance Man holds no surprises what so ever. The formula remains the same as every other piece featuring a teacher and an unruly/troubled/under educated class. So with that in mind, and considering the film has largely been kicked by the professional critics, I'm not here to sell this movie to anyone, because sometimes you have to acknowledge that a film can hit a spot of your own personal psyche, yet at the same time be a million miles away from someone else's. The choices we make dictate the life we lead For me personally, Renaissance Man is one such film. It was one dark rainy night back in the mid 90s and I had the blues, I popped over to the video store to see what was available, I couldn't find anything that remotely sounded like something to lift me out of the stupor I was in. I then spied a copy of Renaissance Man, a film I hadn't heard anything about, and although I took that as a bad sign, Danny DeVito's beaming smile on the cover of the box lured me in. I was thinking how much I had enjoyed him in Twins at the back end of 1988, so to me it didn't seem such a bad gamble to take. I was expecting a comedy and I got one, but the bonus was that what I also got was a very uplifting dramatic tale about the human condition, people learning from each other, a tale that shows the power of artistry and how it can unite and lift people. A tale that shows that maybe some folk aren't as clever as others, but if they can grasp a straw and be all that they can be, then their heads will be well and truly held up high. Renaissance Man, I believe, is a sadly undervalued film on this, or any other film related site. But that's just me, because hey! We all got different psyche's right. Right? 8/10

    Halt thyself, thou knave. I shall tell thee of a film in which a great thespian of our time plays a man who teacheth a group of milit'ry people about one of the greatest playwrights of all time. Never have these men and wenches known such masterful work, but eager they are to learn. OK, I'll cut the Shakespearean talk. But the point is that "Renaissance Man" is a really cool movie, with Danny DeVito as a literature teacher who joins the army and teaches some of the recruits about Shakespeare. This was certainly one of the under-appreciated comedies of the 1990s (specifically, one showing that you don't need scatological humor to make a good comedy). At the very least, it should be interesting to see Mark Wahlberg in his film debut. But even beyond that, I would say that there's lots to admire here. I definitely recommend it. Also starring Kadeem Hardison and Cliff Robertson.

    Renaissance Man stands out in my memory as one of those very few movies that lingers throughout the years, inspirational as well as entertaining. I cannot understand why it wasn't a box office hit worldwide! Its message transcends cultures and times (although not entirely transcends literature, thanks to the Shakespeare link). Even there the message is strong - losers can win if they're given encouragement and a challenge. It's a timeless message, and it's true. Add to that Mr. de Vito's hidden talent as a reluctant yet innovative teacher who makes the grade differently, and you have - together with the classic theme of everyone being an individual,yet with an identical need for appreciation - a winning plot. But there's more. It's(looking back now) a star studded cast also! Mark Wahlberg made his debut in this movie, and if you look, today you'll see other notables as well, younger. This is a movie in which the author, director, casting director, cameraman, actors - oh heck, the entire crew - excel as a team. The whole is superbly a multiplication of its parts. It deserves to be watched every year or so, if only to be reminded of the empathetic message. I marvel at how the author came up with this story, which keeps showing more insight as it meanders through the experiment of a failed advertising man having to teach in the US Army just to keep alive. It's fun, encouraging and clever. The plot and its subplots are captivating, the actors convincing, and right at the end kindness and heroism win out - convincingly. I often recall an unforgettable line delivered by de Vito, and the context in which he says it: "The choices you make dictate the life you will lead." Upbeat, funny, touching and inspirational. Could Shakespeare have done better? I doubt it. Definitely a classic.

    This is one of those movies that, while not a blockbuster, is well-written and executed adequately. The story is a fine example of instilling a sense of self-confidence in a group of people that have grown up thinking they were deficient in some way, only to discover that they have the same abilities as everyone else. It's not the sort of movie I'd go see in a theater, but is one that I like to watch from time to time. The 8 ranking is exclusively for the concept, and surely not for the acting. Danny DeVito is clearly the best portrayed character in that regard, however. Gregory Hines gives his character an extreme over-the-top feel that is more accurately associated with Marine Corps Drill Instructors than Army Drill Sergeants. It doesn't work very well with the more laid-back atmosphere of Army training.
