Along the way, Kate and Luc begin having feelings for each other, because this is what happened in every Meg Ryan Movie in the nineties...... If it wasn't for Kline or Reno, this would have gotten a two all the way, and if it were made today, I'm sure it'd star Katherine Heigl and just be as bland. Which is another way of saying that the film is as bland and as generic as romantic comedies can be, but with the added element of xenophobia. Ryan has never been more annoying, from her shouting for no reason at all, to her silly John Lennon style sunglasses, every scene in which see is in is annihilated, and there are plenty to choose from because she produced the blasted thing. It looks beautiful though, and as I've already said, I'll watch Kline read the phone book, but this really is the pits.

    I tried to find this film amusing. I know that Meg Ryan is not known for appearing in heavyweight philosophical flicks; productions with her name above the title are usually filed under "mildly pleasant pastimes that require little to no viewer engagement." Unbelievable plot? Check. Stupid "misunderstandings" that a seven-year-old would clear up with one question and one answer, but that drag on through the whole picture? Check. And yet again Ryan tries to trade in on her "perky girl-next- door fresh wholesome" cuteness. But in this light-as-air comedy, her performance descends into caricature, not character. All the well-known Ryan tics are there: the waving of the arms, the hand to the forehead signaling "Oh I don't believe this, poor me", the little sniffs and puffs that were part of the "cute little Missy" repertoire of the 80s have become an exaggerated near-parody in this film. We won't even discuss her over the top yelps about "mucus" and lactose intolerance (which is no laughing matter for those who actually suffer from it). I hate to tell the scriptwriter, but romantic emoting, even good sex, will not cure food allergies. We also won't discuss the anti-French culture memes in this script. How they convinced Jean Reno to work in this movie we will never know. I can watch just about any comedy on a Saturday afternoon, but this is one of those films that made me want those 90+ min of my life back. I sat through it hoping it would go somewhere, and the ending was so bad my companion and I just sat there staring at each other. "That's it? That's all?" The-the, the-the, the-that's all folks. I'd give it minus 5 out of 10 if I could.

    The story revolves around Kate (Meg Ryan), who is a school teacher living in Canada and engaged to marry Charlie (Timothy Hutton). Suddenly, Charlie travels to Paris on business and announces to Kate that he has decided to stay in Paris because he has fallen in love. Although Kate is extremely fearful of flying, she hops on a plane to Paris to get her Charlie back. On this flight, her seat-mate is Luc (Kevin Kline) who uses her to smuggle in a stolen diamond necklace. Upon arriving in Paris, Luc follows Kate because he has hidden the jewels in her backpack. The adventure continues when Luc proclaims that he can help her win her Charlie back. The duo travel from Paris to Cannes as Luc provides specific advice on how Kate should handle this situation and confront the Charlie and his new girlfriend. The dialogue is witty and fun as the film continues with a stop to visit Luc's family in the scenically appropriate French wine countryside. The banter between Luc and Kate throughout the film is clever and cute. Kate fills the movie with witty lines that become memorable because of her frustration with Luc. One of my favorite lines is when Kate tells Luc, "You'll become one of those hunchbacked, lonely old men, sitting in the corner of a crowded caf&eacute;, mumbling to yourself, 'My ass is twitching. You people make my ass twitch'". During their escapades, Luc becomes quite fond of Kate, even with her constant sarcastic remarks. This is a perfect romantic comedy about boy meets girl while trying to win another boy back. The scenes used in the film are vibrantly beautiful with locations which include Paris, Cannes and Provence regions. I'm not a big fan of Meg Ryan but this film compares to the warm, funny, romantic appeal that Sleepless in Seattle offered. Kevin Kline is this adorably macho French thief whose mission is to use the money from this stolen necklace to buy land to start a vineyard. Kate's goal conveyed since the beginning of the film is for her to "put down some roots and watch them grow". Coincidentally, it appears they have similar goals but do they ever discover this connection? We should also mention how wonderful the music is. After seeing this film, I immediately obtained a copy of the soundtrack. Although there are two renditions of "I Love Paris," they are both equally enjoyable. Kevin Kline sings a beautifully loungy song called "La Mer" in the film. It makes me sway and imagine that I'm in Paris hearing this at a caf&eacute; sipping some wine.

    I really don't know why I wanted to see this movie, but I think it is because the cover looked cool so I sought of put it onto my want to see list. It wasn't all that crash hot, more of what one would call a chick flick. I am not entirely against chick-flicks, but there are films that have style and films that don't, and I'm afraid that French Kiss doesn't. Basically this woman's fianc&eacute; goes to France and then decides that he will fall in love with a woman there and break off the engagement to her. She decides to go over there to try and patch up the marriage, but she isn't really allowed to leave until her citizenship comes through. She leaves anyway and when she looses everything, she cannot return because the Canadians don't want her and the Americans are offended that she would rather live in Canada than in America. Anyway, everything seems bad, but this one guy who is a petty thief decides to help her out to get her fianc&eacute; back, but one wonders why one would want a fianc&eacute; back when he dumped you for a woman he just met. She wants security and believes that this guy will give her security. What she needed to do though was learn to take risks. She really did not want to take any risks, she simply wanted back what was familiar, but soon comes to realise that the familiar is not all that worth it. So in the end she takes the risk and goes for the guy that she really did not know all that well and knew was a petty thief.

    Lawrence Kasdan's 'French Kiss' is a film, that offers Fair Entertainment. But if you take it too seriously and if you go inn with huge expectations, chances are you might come out with a frown. 'French Kiss' is a Romantic-Comedy, where A woman flies to France to confront her straying fianc&eacute;, but gets into trouble when the charming crook seated next to her, uses her for smuggling. Adam Brooks's Writing in the first hour is entertaining, and manages to hold your attention thoroughly. But, in the second hour, it falters, especially during it's finale. Though it comes up with a innovative idea to disclose it's final act, the impact seems to be missing. But, again, it doesn't really leave you angry or really disappointed. Lawrence Kasdan's direction is fair. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Meg Ryan is Excellent, and quite frankly delivers one of her finest performances in here. Kevin Kline as a Frenchman, gets his accent and pronunciation right, and entertains in the goings-on. Timothy Hutton is passable. Jean Reno is dependable, as always. Suzan Anbeh is alright. On the whole, Watch it on a Lazy Sunday After-Noon.

    I loved the music; the Beautiful South sang the tunes and that stuck with me as much as the movie; maybe even more. Dream a little Dream is a knock out, you will be singing all the next day. The film meshed so nicely with the story. For me it was a perfect blend of the two. A picture that Cary Grant would have been perfect with someone like Kerr or Hepburn. Saw it one Saturday on TV and perhaps not the ideal setting, but it is is a favorite boy meets girl love story. The plot is summarized as well as I've seen, here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Kiss_%28film%29 This is why if you've not seen it, you'll want to give it a chance.

    This is my favorite movie of all times!!! I love the scenery, photographs, clever dialogs, the performance is superb.... 10 out of 10. An ordinary topic with a twist... I can only congratulate the producer and director for making this movie something to remember for the rest of my days. It is quite funny and romantic, makes a person believe anything can happen. Locations encouraged me to fly to France and the 452 types of cheese will be stuck on my mind forever. Definitely number one on my list. You can watch it with friends or with a date to pass a good time! Also, soundtrack is awesome... ever since I watched this movie, Dream a little dream of me is my favorite romantic song. I wish someone would sing it to me someday. I sincerely don't understand why the low score...

    Possible spoiler..... Kevin Kline as a Frenchman? I was intrigued. And yes, he does it perfectly so far as I - not being French but having been there often - can ascertain. I see he was born in Missouri so I assume he must be bi-lingual? What a fun story! The reason I don't give this movie 9 is that the Canadian boyfriend's French interest doesn't get enough attention - it becomes clear eventually that she has "a story to tell" but we have only a hint of it and I found this frustrating. At first she seems just a ruthless bimbo- fianc&eacute;-snatcher, but when Kline's character talks to her we see she's far from that, truly is in love with the berk, she's not as young as she first seemed and she's certainly not objectionable at all - there's such a poignancy about her, very well acted, finally giving the actress a chance to show her quality yet in a few moments that scene's over and we learn no more. I immediately wanted to know more about her along with wondering why this intelligent girl was wasting herself on a twerp the actual heroine is clearly well rid of - so the French girl's past must explain this. Unfortunately the movie doesn't deliver on "the other woman" beyond this one brief moment, a major disappointment. On the other hand, she does it seems get what she was longing for, which is good. I'm not sure whether we're supposed to feel for the Canadian boyfriend, that he couldn't help changing his allegiance, or to despise him. I felt the actor wasn't sure which angle to put over, another reason for this movie failing for me to achieve 9 or 10. A mention though for the thief's policeman "friend" - a very good subplot. This movie's a "not to be missed", with a lot of laughs and a very engaging story line, enhanced by the fine French settings and a splendid finale. Notice the dress Meg Ryan is wearing in that last scene - so evocative, simply perfect........

    "When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself, one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls romance." --Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Kate's (Meg Ryan) love-of-her-life, Charlie (Timothy Hutton) travels to France, where he meets his love-of-his-life, thereby leaving Kate. Misbegotten, forlorn, neurotic, rudderless Kate pursues Charlie to France, where she meets an all-new, all-French love-of-her-life, Luc (Kevin Kline). After unfathomably contrived and criminal adventures, Happily Ever After ensues. Kline as Luc is the only watchable thing in FRENCH KISS - besides the glorious Parisian backdrop. The great Jean Reno (LEON, 1992) plays a one-dimensional French cop who allows Luc to evding him because Luc savid hislife once; Hutton is a McGuffin and his high-thighed temptress merely a plot element. And Ryan is so ingenuously irritating and cloying and provincial and desperate and ugly it is no wonder she had that facelift that destroyed her face and career. Timothy Hutton's character does exactly the same thing Warren Beatty does in LOVE AFFAIR 1994 - finds "true love" on a trip abroad and leaves his current partner to pursue it. Yet this movie makes him the Bad Guy! Even though, like Beatty, he professes his new love is The Real Thing. But "true love" here is from the dumped partner's point of view: "...because my love is there with his slut girlfriend..." And true love to Kate is what she has been indoctrinated with in her immature Disney and Brady Bunch culture. She actually says: "I'm gonna get him back, and I'm gonna make him love me and we are gonna live happily ever after!" Free Will, emotions, hormones, pheromones, rationale, reality be damned. Kate meets Luc on the plane. He uses her to unknowingly smuggle a small grapevine into France. This redemptive gimmick only exists to cushion the blow of perceiving him as a one-dimensional thief - the "tender" side of Luc as he fawns over this vine sapling with which he aims to start a vineyard and Go Legit (of course, his idea of Legit is to illegitimately rip off anyone who could contribute towards his Legit Dream.) We are meant to harken back to this sapling again and again as Luc perpetrates criminal act after criminal act for the sake of "love" and his "dream." While in France, Kate gets her bag stolen, so Luc (at this point, her pseudo-beau) steals a car to recover her bag. But he's so SENSITIVE with that tender sapling and all... Luc is also in possession of a stolen bracelet - but there's that sapling thing... In trying to re-steal his necklace from another con-man, Luc steals a bike. How many people laughed at the owner of the bike running after Luc in fury? Answer: Everyone. Because that sapling, oh, that sapling, illustrating his nurturing and caring side... But all that stealing and low crime is simply to kill time while Luc and Kate fall for each other in Paris. Luc calls attention to the woman's "weapon" - the Pout - where she implies Yes when she means No and says No when she means Yes, leaving her suitor in a state of lustful disarray. How does this appraisal sit with all those High Court Judges and sleek-thighed, mini-skirted temptresses insisting that NoMeansNo? The same audience that laughed at all those wrongful deeds that Luc perpetrated are now faced with either agreeing with this summation of a woman's Asking For It, or dismissing it as film-maker's fancy. Kate is oblivious to the Eiffel Tower, continually missing glimpses of it, until her latent sexual feelings (euphemized in the film as "love") rise to the surface. Only when she realises she is "falling in love" does she notice that BIG PENIS. What we can learn from FRENCH KISS: bleary-eyed women will lament, "This is how a man should woo me!" (Yeah, be a criminal and steal things for me.) Men will view this pathetic farce as education, gleaning the angles women will fall for in The Cultivation. The most valuable lesson any man can learn from any Romantic Comedy is: Disguising the fact that the One Thing is prevalent in your mind, is the quickest way to get the One Thing. Movie ends with Luc and Kate strolling through that vaunted vineyard he committed all those crimes to attain. Legitimately, of course. Ain't love grand theft auto? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    Starring Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, and Timothy Hutton, this is a most enjoyable little film. If you can get past the first few minutes and bear another mousy-type and phobia-driven performance by Meg, this is a nice way to pass the time. In fact, her peculiarities make her character so real, one really understands and sympathizes with her and can put themselves in her position. Kline is very believable as a french man, and their chemistry comes off surprisingly well. The only reason I didn't give this more than a 6 is because, while it is charming and enjoyable, I couldn't help feeling that there are a whole lot more "romantic comedies" that "French Kiss" couldn't even compare to. This almost feels like a poor man's "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure.

    I loved the music; the Beautiful South sang the tunes and that stuck with me as much as the movie; maybe even more. Dream a little Dream is a knock out, you will be singing all the next day. The film meshed so nicely with the story. For me it was a perfect blend of the two. A picture that Cary Grant would have been perfect with someone like Kerr or Hepburn. Saw it one Saturday on TV and perhaps not the ideal setting, but it is is a favorite boy meets girl love story. The plot is summarized as well as I've seen, here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Kiss_%28film%29 This is why if you've not seen it, you'll want to give it a chance.

    This is my favorite movie of all times!!! I love the scenery, photographs, clever dialogs, the performance is superb.... 10 out of 10. An ordinary topic with a twist... I can only congratulate the producer and director for making this movie something to remember for the rest of my days. It is quite funny and romantic, makes a person believe anything can happen. Locations encouraged me to fly to France and the 452 types of cheese will be stuck on my mind forever. Definitely number one on my list. You can watch it with friends or with a date to pass a good time! Also, soundtrack is awesome... ever since I watched this movie, Dream a little dream of me is my favorite romantic song. I wish someone would sing it to me someday. I sincerely don't understand why the low score...

    Possible spoiler..... Kevin Kline as a Frenchman? I was intrigued. And yes, he does it perfectly so far as I - not being French but having been there often - can ascertain. I see he was born in Missouri so I assume he must be bi-lingual? What a fun story! The reason I don't give this movie 9 is that the Canadian boyfriend's French interest doesn't get enough attention - it becomes clear eventually that she has "a story to tell" but we have only a hint of it and I found this frustrating. At first she seems just a ruthless bimbo- fianc&eacute;-snatcher, but when Kline's character talks to her we see she's far from that, truly is in love with the berk, she's not as young as she first seemed and she's certainly not objectionable at all - there's such a poignancy about her, very well acted, finally giving the actress a chance to show her quality yet in a few moments that scene's over and we learn no more. I immediately wanted to know more about her along with wondering why this intelligent girl was wasting herself on a twerp the actual heroine is clearly well rid of - so the French girl's past must explain this. Unfortunately the movie doesn't deliver on "the other woman" beyond this one brief moment, a major disappointment. On the other hand, she does it seems get what she was longing for, which is good. I'm not sure whether we're supposed to feel for the Canadian boyfriend, that he couldn't help changing his allegiance, or to despise him. I felt the actor wasn't sure which angle to put over, another reason for this movie failing for me to achieve 9 or 10. A mention though for the thief's policeman "friend" - a very good subplot. This movie's a "not to be missed", with a lot of laughs and a very engaging story line, enhanced by the fine French settings and a splendid finale. Notice the dress Meg Ryan is wearing in that last scene - so evocative, simply perfect........

    "When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself, one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls romance." --Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Kate's (Meg Ryan) love-of-her-life, Charlie (Timothy Hutton) travels to France, where he meets his love-of-his-life, thereby leaving Kate. Misbegotten, forlorn, neurotic, rudderless Kate pursues Charlie to France, where she meets an all-new, all-French love-of-her-life, Luc (Kevin Kline). After unfathomably contrived and criminal adventures, Happily Ever After ensues. Kline as Luc is the only watchable thing in FRENCH KISS - besides the glorious Parisian backdrop. The great Jean Reno (LEON, 1992) plays a one-dimensional French cop who allows Luc to evding him because Luc savid hislife once; Hutton is a McGuffin and his high-thighed temptress merely a plot element. And Ryan is so ingenuously irritating and cloying and provincial and desperate and ugly it is no wonder she had that facelift that destroyed her face and career. Timothy Hutton's character does exactly the same thing Warren Beatty does in LOVE AFFAIR 1994 - finds "true love" on a trip abroad and leaves his current partner to pursue it. Yet this movie makes him the Bad Guy! Even though, like Beatty, he professes his new love is The Real Thing. But "true love" here is from the dumped partner's point of view: "...because my love is there with his slut girlfriend..." And true love to Kate is what she has been indoctrinated with in her immature Disney and Brady Bunch culture. She actually says: "I'm gonna get him back, and I'm gonna make him love me and we are gonna live happily ever after!" Free Will, emotions, hormones, pheromones, rationale, reality be damned. Kate meets Luc on the plane. He uses her to unknowingly smuggle a small grapevine into France. This redemptive gimmick only exists to cushion the blow of perceiving him as a one-dimensional thief - the "tender" side of Luc as he fawns over this vine sapling with which he aims to start a vineyard and Go Legit (of course, his idea of Legit is to illegitimately rip off anyone who could contribute towards his Legit Dream.) We are meant to harken back to this sapling again and again as Luc perpetrates criminal act after criminal act for the sake of "love" and his "dream." While in France, Kate gets her bag stolen, so Luc (at this point, her pseudo-beau) steals a car to recover her bag. But he's so SENSITIVE with that tender sapling and all... Luc is also in possession of a stolen bracelet - but there's that sapling thing... In trying to re-steal his necklace from another con-man, Luc steals a bike. How many people laughed at the owner of the bike running after Luc in fury? Answer: Everyone. Because that sapling, oh, that sapling, illustrating his nurturing and caring side... But all that stealing and low crime is simply to kill time while Luc and Kate fall for each other in Paris. Luc calls attention to the woman's "weapon" - the Pout - where she implies Yes when she means No and says No when she means Yes, leaving her suitor in a state of lustful disarray. How does this appraisal sit with all those High Court Judges and sleek-thighed, mini-skirted temptresses insisting that NoMeansNo? The same audience that laughed at all those wrongful deeds that Luc perpetrated are now faced with either agreeing with this summation of a woman's Asking For It, or dismissing it as film-maker's fancy. Kate is oblivious to the Eiffel Tower, continually missing glimpses of it, until her latent sexual feelings (euphemized in the film as "love") rise to the surface. Only when she realises she is "falling in love" does she notice that BIG PENIS. What we can learn from FRENCH KISS: bleary-eyed women will lament, "This is how a man should woo me!" (Yeah, be a criminal and steal things for me.) Men will view this pathetic farce as education, gleaning the angles women will fall for in The Cultivation. The most valuable lesson any man can learn from any Romantic Comedy is: Disguising the fact that the One Thing is prevalent in your mind, is the quickest way to get the One Thing. Movie ends with Luc and Kate strolling through that vaunted vineyard he committed all those crimes to attain. Legitimately, of course. Ain't love grand theft auto? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    Starring Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, and Timothy Hutton, this is a most enjoyable little film. If you can get past the first few minutes and bear another mousy-type and phobia-driven performance by Meg, this is a nice way to pass the time. In fact, her peculiarities make her character so real, one really understands and sympathizes with her and can put themselves in her position. Kline is very believable as a french man, and their chemistry comes off surprisingly well. The only reason I didn't give this more than a 6 is because, while it is charming and enjoyable, I couldn't help feeling that there are a whole lot more "romantic comedies" that "French Kiss" couldn't even compare to. This almost feels like a poor man's "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure.

    Kate and Charlie have a perfect life planned out before them. Buy a house, marriage, kids, the whole works. Kate's fear of flying keeps her in Canada while Charlie goes to Paris for a medical convention. While there Charlie falls for Juliette. He calls off the wedding with Kate and she nervously boards a plane to get him back. She ends up sitting next to French thief Luc. He hides a stolen necklace and smuggled grape vine in her bag to get it through customs. Her bag is stolen, the necklace apparently lost, and Kate and Luc head to Cannes, Luc to find the necklace and Kate get Charlie back. Along the way, Kate and Luc begin having feelings for each other, because this is what happened in every Meg Ryan Movie in the nineties...... If it wasn't for Kline or Reno, this would have gotten a two all the way, and if it were made today, I'm sure it'd star Katherine Heigl and just be as bland. Which is another way of saying that the film is as bland and as generic as romantic comedies can be, but with the added element of xenophobia. Ryan has never been more annoying, from her shouting for no reason at all, to her silly John Lennon style sunglasses, every scene in which see is in is annihilated, and there are plenty to choose from because she produced the blasted thing. It looks beautiful though, and as I've already said, I'll watch Kline read the phone book, but this really is the pits.

    I tried to find this film amusing. I know that Meg Ryan is not known for appearing in heavyweight philosophical flicks; productions with her name above the title are usually filed under "mildly pleasant pastimes that require little to no viewer engagement." Unbelievable plot? Check. Stupid "misunderstandings" that a seven-year-old would clear up with one question and one answer, but that drag on through the whole picture? Check. And yet again Ryan tries to trade in on her "perky girl-next- door fresh wholesome" cuteness. But in this light-as-air comedy, her performance descends into caricature, not character. All the well-known Ryan tics are there: the waving of the arms, the hand to the forehead signaling "Oh I don't believe this, poor me", the little sniffs and puffs that were part of the "cute little Missy" repertoire of the 80s have become an exaggerated near-parody in this film. We won't even discuss her over the top yelps about "mucus" and lactose intolerance (which is no laughing matter for those who actually suffer from it). I hate to tell the scriptwriter, but romantic emoting, even good sex, will not cure food allergies. We also won't discuss the anti-French culture memes in this script. How they convinced Jean Reno to work in this movie we will never know. I can watch just about any comedy on a Saturday afternoon, but this is one of those films that made me want those 90+ min of my life back. I sat through it hoping it would go somewhere, and the ending was so bad my companion and I just sat there staring at each other. "That's it? That's all?" The-the, the-the, the-that's all folks. I'd give it minus 5 out of 10 if I could.

    The story revolves around Kate (Meg Ryan), who is a school teacher living in Canada and engaged to marry Charlie (Timothy Hutton). Suddenly, Charlie travels to Paris on business and announces to Kate that he has decided to stay in Paris because he has fallen in love. Although Kate is extremely fearful of flying, she hops on a plane to Paris to get her Charlie back. On this flight, her seat-mate is Luc (Kevin Kline) who uses her to smuggle in a stolen diamond necklace. Upon arriving in Paris, Luc follows Kate because he has hidden the jewels in her backpack. The adventure continues when Luc proclaims that he can help her win her Charlie back. The duo travel from Paris to Cannes as Luc provides specific advice on how Kate should handle this situation and confront the Charlie and his new girlfriend. The dialogue is witty and fun as the film continues with a stop to visit Luc's family in the scenically appropriate French wine countryside. The banter between Luc and Kate throughout the film is clever and cute. Kate fills the movie with witty lines that become memorable because of her frustration with Luc. One of my favorite lines is when Kate tells Luc, "You'll become one of those hunchbacked, lonely old men, sitting in the corner of a crowded caf&eacute;, mumbling to yourself, 'My ass is twitching. You people make my ass twitch'". During their escapades, Luc becomes quite fond of Kate, even with her constant sarcastic remarks. This is a perfect romantic comedy about boy meets girl while trying to win another boy back. The scenes used in the film are vibrantly beautiful with locations which include Paris, Cannes and Provence regions. I'm not a big fan of Meg Ryan but this film compares to the warm, funny, romantic appeal that Sleepless in Seattle offered. Kevin Kline is this adorably macho French thief whose mission is to use the money from this stolen necklace to buy land to start a vineyard. Kate's goal conveyed since the beginning of the film is for her to "put down some roots and watch them grow". Coincidentally, it appears they have similar goals but do they ever discover this connection? We should also mention how wonderful the music is. After seeing this film, I immediately obtained a copy of the soundtrack. Although there are two renditions of "I Love Paris," they are both equally enjoyable. Kevin Kline sings a beautifully loungy song called "La Mer" in the film. It makes me sway and imagine that I'm in Paris hearing this at a caf&eacute; sipping some wine.

    I really don't know why I wanted to see this movie, but I think it is because the cover looked cool so I sought of put it onto my want to see list. It wasn't all that crash hot, more of what one would call a chick flick. I am not entirely against chick-flicks, but there are films that have style and films that don't, and I'm afraid that French Kiss doesn't. Basically this woman's fianc&eacute; goes to France and then decides that he will fall in love with a woman there and break off the engagement to her. She decides to go over there to try and patch up the marriage, but she isn't really allowed to leave until her citizenship comes through. She leaves anyway and when she looses everything, she cannot return because the Canadians don't want her and the Americans are offended that she would rather live in Canada than in America. Anyway, everything seems bad, but this one guy who is a petty thief decides to help her out to get her fianc&eacute; back, but one wonders why one would want a fianc&eacute; back when he dumped you for a woman he just met. She wants security and believes that this guy will give her security. What she needed to do though was learn to take risks. She really did not want to take any risks, she simply wanted back what was familiar, but soon comes to realise that the familiar is not all that worth it. So in the end she takes the risk and goes for the guy that she really did not know all that well and knew was a petty thief.

    Lawrence Kasdan's 'French Kiss' is a film, that offers Fair Entertainment. But if you take it too seriously and if you go inn with huge expectations, chances are you might come out with a frown. 'French Kiss' is a Romantic-Comedy, where A woman flies to France to confront her straying fianc&eacute;, but gets into trouble when the charming crook seated next to her, uses her for smuggling. Adam Brooks's Writing in the first hour is entertaining, and manages to hold your attention thoroughly. But, in the second hour, it falters, especially during it's finale. Though it comes up with a innovative idea to disclose it's final act, the impact seems to be missing. But, again, it doesn't really leave you angry or really disappointed. Lawrence Kasdan's direction is fair. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Meg Ryan is Excellent, and quite frankly delivers one of her finest performances in here. Kevin Kline as a Frenchman, gets his accent and pronunciation right, and entertains in the goings-on. Timothy Hutton is passable. Jean Reno is dependable, as always. Suzan Anbeh is alright. On the whole, Watch it on a Lazy Sunday After-Noon.

I know that Meg Ryan is not known for appearing in heavyweight philosophical flicks; productions with her name above the title are usually filed under "mildly pleasant pastimes that require little to no viewer engagement." Unbelievable plot? Check. Stupid "misunderstandings" that a seven-year-old would clear up with one question and one answer, but that drag on through the whole picture? Check. And yet again Ryan tries to trade in on her "perky girl-next- door fresh wholesome" cuteness. But in this light-as-air comedy, her performance descends into caricature, not character. All the well-known Ryan tics are there: the waving of the arms, the hand to the forehead signaling "Oh I don't believe this, poor me", the little sniffs and puffs that were part of the "cute little Missy" repertoire of the 80s have become an exaggerated near-parody in this film. We won't even discuss her over the top yelps about "mucus" and lactose intolerance (which is no laughing matter for those who actually suffer from it). I hate to tell the scriptwriter, but romantic emoting, even good sex, will not cure food allergies. We also won't discuss the anti-French culture memes in this script. How they convinced Jean Reno to work in this movie we will never know. I can watch just about any comedy on a Saturday afternoon, but this is one of those films that made me want those 90+ min of my life back. I sat through it hoping it would go somewhere, and the ending was so bad my companion and I just sat there staring at each other. "That's it? That's all?" The-the, the-the, the-that's all folks. I'd give it minus 5 out of 10 if I could.

    The story revolves around Kate (Meg Ryan), who is a school teacher living in Canada and engaged to marry Charlie (Timothy Hutton). Suddenly, Charlie travels to Paris on business and announces to Kate that he has decided to stay in Paris because he has fallen in love. Although Kate is extremely fearful of flying, she hops on a plane to Paris to get her Charlie back. On this flight, her seat-mate is Luc (Kevin Kline) who uses her to smuggle in a stolen diamond necklace. Upon arriving in Paris, Luc follows Kate because he has hidden the jewels in her backpack. The adventure continues when Luc proclaims that he can help her win her Charlie back. The duo travel from Paris to Cannes as Luc provides specific advice on how Kate should handle this situation and confront the Charlie and his new girlfriend. The dialogue is witty and fun as the film continues with a stop to visit Luc's family in the scenically appropriate French wine countryside. The banter between Luc and Kate throughout the film is clever and cute. Kate fills the movie with witty lines that become memorable because of her frustration with Luc. One of my favorite lines is when Kate tells Luc, "You'll become one of those hunchbacked, lonely old men, sitting in the corner of a crowded caf&eacute;, mumbling to yourself, 'My ass is twitching. You people make my ass twitch'". During their escapades, Luc becomes quite fond of Kate, even with her constant sarcastic remarks. This is a perfect romantic comedy about boy meets girl while trying to win another boy back. The scenes used in the film are vibrantly beautiful with locations which include Paris, Cannes and Provence regions. I'm not a big fan of Meg Ryan but this film compares to the warm, funny, romantic appeal that Sleepless in Seattle offered. Kevin Kline is this adorably macho French thief whose mission is to use the money from this stolen necklace to buy land to start a vineyard. Kate's goal conveyed since the beginning of the film is for her to "put down some roots and watch them grow". Coincidentally, it appears they have similar goals but do they ever discover this connection? We should also mention how wonderful the music is. After seeing this film, I immediately obtained a copy of the soundtrack. Although there are two renditions of "I Love Paris," they are both equally enjoyable. Kevin Kline sings a beautifully loungy song called "La Mer" in the film. It makes me sway and imagine that I'm in Paris hearing this at a caf&eacute; sipping some wine.

    I really don't know why I wanted to see this movie, but I think it is because the cover looked cool so I sought of put it onto my want to see list. It wasn't all that crash hot, more of what one would call a chick flick. I am not entirely against chick-flicks, but there are films that have style and films that don't, and I'm afraid that French Kiss doesn't. Basically this woman's fianc&eacute; goes to France and then decides that he will fall in love with a woman there and break off the engagement to her. She decides to go over there to try and patch up the marriage, but she isn't really allowed to leave until her citizenship comes through. She leaves anyway and when she looses everything, she cannot return because the Canadians don't want her and the Americans are offended that she would rather live in Canada than in America. Anyway, everything seems bad, but this one guy who is a petty thief decides to help her out to get her fianc&eacute; back, but one wonders why one would want a fianc&eacute; back when he dumped you for a woman he just met. She wants security and believes that this guy will give her security. What she needed to do though was learn to take risks. She really did not want to take any risks, she simply wanted back what was familiar, but soon comes to realise that the familiar is not all that worth it. So in the end she takes the risk and goes for the guy that she really did not know all that well and knew was a petty thief.

    Lawrence Kasdan's 'French Kiss' is a film, that offers Fair Entertainment. But if you take it too seriously and if you go inn with huge expectations, chances are you might come out with a frown. 'French Kiss' is a Romantic-Comedy, where A woman flies to France to confront her straying fianc&eacute;, but gets into trouble when the charming crook seated next to her, uses her for smuggling. Adam Brooks's Writing in the first hour is entertaining, and manages to hold your attention thoroughly. But, in the second hour, it falters, especially during it's finale. Though it comes up with a innovative idea to disclose it's final act, the impact seems to be missing. But, again, it doesn't really leave you angry or really disappointed. Lawrence Kasdan's direction is fair. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Meg Ryan is Excellent, and quite frankly delivers one of her finest performances in here. Kevin Kline as a Frenchman, gets his accent and pronunciation right, and entertains in the goings-on. Timothy Hutton is passable. Jean Reno is dependable, as always. Suzan Anbeh is alright. On the whole, Watch it on a Lazy Sunday After-Noon.

    I loved the music; the Beautiful South sang the tunes and that stuck with me as much as the movie; maybe even more. Dream a little Dream is a knock out, you will be singing all the next day. The film meshed so nicely with the story. For me it was a perfect blend of the two. A picture that Cary Grant would have been perfect with someone like Kerr or Hepburn. Saw it one Saturday on TV and perhaps not the ideal setting, but it is is a favorite boy meets girl love story. The plot is summarized as well as I've seen, here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Kiss_%28film%29 This is why if you've not seen it, you'll want to give it a chance.

    This is my favorite movie of all times!!! I love the scenery, photographs, clever dialogs, the performance is superb.... 10 out of 10. An ordinary topic with a twist... I can only congratulate the producer and director for making this movie something to remember for the rest of my days. It is quite funny and romantic, makes a person believe anything can happen. Locations encouraged me to fly to France and the 452 types of cheese will be stuck on my mind forever. Definitely number one on my list. You can watch it with friends or with a date to pass a good time! Also, soundtrack is awesome... ever since I watched this movie, Dream a little dream of me is my favorite romantic song. I wish someone would sing it to me someday. I sincerely don't understand why the low score...

    Possible spoiler..... Kevin Kline as a Frenchman? I was intrigued. And yes, he does it perfectly so far as I - not being French but having been there often - can ascertain. I see he was born in Missouri so I assume he must be bi-lingual? What a fun story! The reason I don't give this movie 9 is that the Canadian boyfriend's French interest doesn't get enough attention - it becomes clear eventually that she has "a story to tell" but we have only a hint of it and I found this frustrating. At first she seems just a ruthless bimbo- fianc&eacute;-snatcher, but when Kline's character talks to her we see she's far from that, truly is in love with the berk, she's not as young as she first seemed and she's certainly not objectionable at all - there's such a poignancy about her, very well acted, finally giving the actress a chance to show her quality yet in a few moments that scene's over and we learn no more. I immediately wanted to know more about her along with wondering why this intelligent girl was wasting herself on a twerp the actual heroine is clearly well rid of - so the French girl's past must explain this. Unfortunately the movie doesn't deliver on "the other woman" beyond this one brief moment, a major disappointment. On the other hand, she does it seems get what she was longing for, which is good. I'm not sure whether we're supposed to feel for the Canadian boyfriend, that he couldn't help changing his allegiance, or to despise him. I felt the actor wasn't sure which angle to put over, another reason for this movie failing for me to achieve 9 or 10. A mention though for the thief's policeman "friend" - a very good subplot. This movie's a "not to be missed", with a lot of laughs and a very engaging story line, enhanced by the fine French settings and a splendid finale. Notice the dress Meg Ryan is wearing in that last scene - so evocative, simply perfect........

    "When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself, one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls romance." --Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Kate's (Meg Ryan) love-of-her-life, Charlie (Timothy Hutton) travels to France, where he meets his love-of-his-life, thereby leaving Kate. Misbegotten, forlorn, neurotic, rudderless Kate pursues Charlie to France, where she meets an all-new, all-French love-of-her-life, Luc (Kevin Kline). After unfathomably contrived and criminal adventures, Happily Ever After ensues. Kline as Luc is the only watchable thing in FRENCH KISS - besides the glorious Parisian backdrop. The great Jean Reno (LEON, 1992) plays a one-dimensional French cop who allows Luc to evding him because Luc savid hislife once; Hutton is a McGuffin and his high-thighed temptress merely a plot element. And Ryan is so ingenuously irritating and cloying and provincial and desperate and ugly it is no wonder she had that facelift that destroyed her face and career. Timothy Hutton's character does exactly the same thing Warren Beatty does in LOVE AFFAIR 1994 - finds "true love" on a trip abroad and leaves his current partner to pursue it. Yet this movie makes him the Bad Guy! Even though, like Beatty, he professes his new love is The Real Thing. But "true love" here is from the dumped partner's point of view: "...because my love is there with his slut girlfriend..." And true love to Kate is what she has been indoctrinated with in her immature Disney and Brady Bunch culture. She actually says: "I'm gonna get him back, and I'm gonna make him love me and we are gonna live happily ever after!" Free Will, emotions, hormones, pheromones, rationale, reality be damned. Kate meets Luc on the plane. He uses her to unknowingly smuggle a small grapevine into France. This redemptive gimmick only exists to cushion the blow of perceiving him as a one-dimensional thief - the "tender" side of Luc as he fawns over this vine sapling with which he aims to start a vineyard and Go Legit (of course, his idea of Legit is to illegitimately rip off anyone who could contribute towards his Legit Dream.) We are meant to harken back to this sapling again and again as Luc perpetrates criminal act after criminal act for the sake of "love" and his "dream." While in France, Kate gets her bag stolen, so Luc (at this point, her pseudo-beau) steals a car to recover her bag. But he's so SENSITIVE with that tender sapling and all... Luc is also in possession of a stolen bracelet - but there's that sapling thing... In trying to re-steal his necklace from another con-man, Luc steals a bike. How many people laughed at the owner of the bike running after Luc in fury? Answer: Everyone. Because that sapling, oh, that sapling, illustrating his nurturing and caring side... But all that stealing and low crime is simply to kill time while Luc and Kate fall for each other in Paris. Luc calls attention to the woman's "weapon" - the Pout - where she implies Yes when she means No and says No when she means Yes, leaving her suitor in a state of lustful disarray. How does this appraisal sit with all those High Court Judges and sleek-thighed, mini-skirted temptresses insisting that NoMeansNo? The same audience that laughed at all those wrongful deeds that Luc perpetrated are now faced with either agreeing with this summation of a woman's Asking For It, or dismissing it as film-maker's fancy. Kate is oblivious to the Eiffel Tower, continually missing glimpses of it, until her latent sexual feelings (euphemized in the film as "love") rise to the surface. Only when she realises she is "falling in love" does she notice that BIG PENIS. What we can learn from FRENCH KISS: bleary-eyed women will lament, "This is how a man should woo me!" (Yeah, be a criminal and steal things for me.) Men will view this pathetic farce as education, gleaning the angles women will fall for in The Cultivation. The most valuable lesson any man can learn from any Romantic Comedy is: Disguising the fact that the One Thing is prevalent in your mind, is the quickest way to get the One Thing. Movie ends with Luc and Kate strolling through that vaunted vineyard he committed all those crimes to attain. Legitimately, of course. Ain't love grand theft auto? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    Starring Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, and Timothy Hutton, this is a most enjoyable little film. If you can get past the first few minutes and bear another mousy-type and phobia-driven performance by Meg, this is a nice way to pass the time. In fact, her peculiarities make her character so real, one really understands and sympathizes with her and can put themselves in her position. Kline is very believable as a french man, and their chemistry comes off surprisingly well. The only reason I didn't give this more than a 6 is because, while it is charming and enjoyable, I couldn't help feeling that there are a whole lot more "romantic comedies" that "French Kiss" couldn't even compare to. This almost feels like a poor man's "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure.

    Kate and Charlie have a perfect life planned out before them. Buy a house, marriage, kids, the whole works. Kate's fear of flying keeps her in Canada while Charlie goes to Paris for a medical convention. While there Charlie falls for Juliette. He calls off the wedding with Kate and she nervously boards a plane to get him back. She ends up sitting next to French thief Luc. He hides a stolen necklace and smuggled grape vine in her bag to get it through customs. Her bag is stolen, the necklace apparently lost, and Kate and Luc head to Cannes, Luc to find the necklace and Kate get Charlie back. Along the way, Kate and Luc begin having feelings for each other, because this is what happened in every Meg Ryan Movie in the nineties...... If it wasn't for Kline or Reno, this would have gotten a two all the way, and if it were made today, I'm sure it'd star Katherine Heigl and just be as bland. Which is another way of saying that the film is as bland and as generic as romantic comedies can be, but with the added element of xenophobia. Ryan has never been more annoying, from her shouting for no reason at all, to her silly John Lennon style sunglasses, every scene in which see is in is annihilated, and there are plenty to choose from because she produced the blasted thing. It looks beautiful though, and as I've already said, I'll watch Kline read the phone book, but this really is the pits.

    "When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself, one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls romance." --Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Kate's (Meg Ryan) love-of-her-life, Charlie (Timothy Hutton) travels to France, where he meets his love-of-his-life, thereby leaving Kate. Misbegotten, forlorn, neurotic, rudderless Kate pursues Charlie to France, where she meets an all-new, all-French love-of-her-life, Luc (Kevin Kline). After unfathomably contrived and criminal adventures, Happily Ever After ensues. Kline as Luc is the only watchable thing in FRENCH KISS - besides the glorious Parisian backdrop. The great Jean Reno (LEON, 1992) plays a one-dimensional French cop who allows Luc to evding him because Luc savid hislife once; Hutton is a McGuffin and his high-thighed temptress merely a plot element. And Ryan is so ingenuously irritating and cloying and provincial and desperate and ugly it is no wonder she had that facelift that destroyed her face and career. Timothy Hutton's character does exactly the same thing Warren Beatty does in LOVE AFFAIR 1994 - finds "true love" on a trip abroad and leaves his current partner to pursue it. Yet this movie makes him the Bad Guy! Even though, like Beatty, he professes his new love is The Real Thing. But "true love" here is from the dumped partner's point of view: "...because my love is there with his slut girlfriend..." And true love to Kate is what she has been indoctrinated with in her immature Disney and Brady Bunch culture. She actually says: "I'm gonna get him back, and I'm gonna make him love me and we are gonna live happily ever after!" Free Will, emotions, hormones, pheromones, rationale, reality be damned. Kate meets Luc on the plane. He uses her to unknowingly smuggle a small grapevine into France. This redemptive gimmick only exists to cushion the blow of perceiving him as a one-dimensional thief - the "tender" side of Luc as he fawns over this vine sapling with which he aims to start a vineyard and Go Legit (of course, his idea of Legit is to illegitimately rip off anyone who could contribute towards his Legit Dream.) We are meant to harken back to this sapling again and again as Luc perpetrates criminal act after criminal act for the sake of "love" and his "dream." While in France, Kate gets her bag stolen, so Luc (at this point, her pseudo-beau) steals a car to recover her bag. But he's so SENSITIVE with that tender sapling and all... Luc is also in possession of a stolen bracelet - but there's that sapling thing... In trying to re-steal his necklace from another con-man, Luc steals a bike. How many people laughed at the owner of the bike running after Luc in fury? Answer: Everyone. Because that sapling, oh, that sapling, illustrating his nurturing and caring side... But all that stealing and low crime is simply to kill time while Luc and Kate fall for each other in Paris. Luc calls attention to the woman's "weapon" - the Pout - where she implies Yes when she means No and says No when she means Yes, leaving her suitor in a state of lustful disarray. How does this appraisal sit with all those High Court Judges and sleek-thighed, mini-skirted temptresses insisting that NoMeansNo? The same audience that laughed at all those wrongful deeds that Luc perpetrated are now faced with either agreeing with this summation of a woman's Asking For It, or dismissing it as film-maker's fancy. Kate is oblivious to the Eiffel Tower, continually missing glimpses of it, until her latent sexual feelings (euphemized in the film as "love") rise to the surface. Only when she realises she is "falling in love" does she notice that BIG PENIS. What we can learn from FRENCH KISS: bleary-eyed women will lament, "This is how a man should woo me!" (Yeah, be a criminal and steal things for me.) Men will view this pathetic farce as education, gleaning the angles women will fall for in The Cultivation. The most valuable lesson any man can learn from any Romantic Comedy is: Disguising the fact that the One Thing is prevalent in your mind, is the quickest way to get the One Thing. Movie ends with Luc and Kate strolling through that vaunted vineyard he committed all those crimes to attain. Legitimately, of course. Ain't love grand theft auto? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    Starring Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, and Timothy Hutton, this is a most enjoyable little film. If you can get past the first few minutes and bear another mousy-type and phobia-driven performance by Meg, this is a nice way to pass the time. In fact, her peculiarities make her character so real, one really understands and sympathizes with her and can put themselves in her position. Kline is very believable as a french man, and their chemistry comes off surprisingly well. The only reason I didn't give this more than a 6 is because, while it is charming and enjoyable, I couldn't help feeling that there are a whole lot more "romantic comedies" that "French Kiss" couldn't even compare to. This almost feels like a poor man's "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure.

    Kate and Charlie have a perfect life planned out before them. Buy a house, marriage, kids, the whole works. Kate's fear of flying keeps her in Canada while Charlie goes to Paris for a medical convention. While there Charlie falls for Juliette. He calls off the wedding with Kate and she nervously boards a plane to get him back. She ends up sitting next to French thief Luc. He hides a stolen necklace and smuggled grape vine in her bag to get it through customs. Her bag is stolen, the necklace apparently lost, and Kate and Luc head to Cannes, Luc to find the necklace and Kate get Charlie back. Along the way, Kate and Luc begin having feelings for each other, because this is what happened in every Meg Ryan Movie in the nineties...... If it wasn't for Kline or Reno, this would have gotten a two all the way, and if it were made today, I'm sure it'd star Katherine Heigl and just be as bland. Which is another way of saying that the film is as bland and as generic as romantic comedies can be, but with the added element of xenophobia. Ryan has never been more annoying, from her shouting for no reason at all, to her silly John Lennon style sunglasses, every scene in which see is in is annihilated, and there are plenty to choose from because she produced the blasted thing. It looks beautiful though, and as I've already said, I'll watch Kline read the phone book, but this really is the pits.

    I tried to find this film amusing. I know that Meg Ryan is not known for appearing in heavyweight philosophical flicks; productions with her name above the title are usually filed under "mildly pleasant pastimes that require little to no viewer engagement." Unbelievable plot? Check. Stupid "misunderstandings" that a seven-year-old would clear up with one question and one answer, but that drag on through the whole picture? Check. And yet again Ryan tries to trade in on her "perky girl-next- door fresh wholesome" cuteness. But in this light-as-air comedy, her performance descends into caricature, not character. All the well-known Ryan tics are there: the waving of the arms, the hand to the forehead signaling "Oh I don't believe this, poor me", the little sniffs and puffs that were part of the "cute little Missy" repertoire of the 80s have become an exaggerated near-parody in this film. We won't even discuss her over the top yelps about "mucus" and lactose intolerance (which is no laughing matter for those who actually suffer from it). I hate to tell the scriptwriter, but romantic emoting, even good sex, will not cure food allergies. We also won't discuss the anti-French culture memes in this script. How they convinced Jean Reno to work in this movie we will never know. I can watch just about any comedy on a Saturday afternoon, but this is one of those films that made me want those 90+ min of my life back. I sat through it hoping it would go somewhere, and the ending was so bad my companion and I just sat there staring at each other. "That's it? That's all?" The-the, the-the, the-that's all folks. I'd give it minus 5 out of 10 if I could.

    The story revolves around Kate (Meg Ryan), who is a school teacher living in Canada and engaged to marry Charlie (Timothy Hutton). Suddenly, Charlie travels to Paris on business and announces to Kate that he has decided to stay in Paris because he has fallen in love. Although Kate is extremely fearful of flying, she hops on a plane to Paris to get her Charlie back. On this flight, her seat-mate is Luc (Kevin Kline) who uses her to smuggle in a stolen diamond necklace. Upon arriving in Paris, Luc follows Kate because he has hidden the jewels in her backpack. The adventure continues when Luc proclaims that he can help her win her Charlie back. The duo travel from Paris to Cannes as Luc provides specific advice on how Kate should handle this situation and confront the Charlie and his new girlfriend. The dialogue is witty and fun as the film continues with a stop to visit Luc's family in the scenically appropriate French wine countryside. The banter between Luc and Kate throughout the film is clever and cute. Kate fills the movie with witty lines that become memorable because of her frustration with Luc. One of my favorite lines is when Kate tells Luc, "You'll become one of those hunchbacked, lonely old men, sitting in the corner of a crowded caf&eacute;, mumbling to yourself, 'My ass is twitching. You people make my ass twitch'". During their escapades, Luc becomes quite fond of Kate, even with her constant sarcastic remarks. This is a perfect romantic comedy about boy meets girl while trying to win another boy back. The scenes used in the film are vibrantly beautiful with locations which include Paris, Cannes and Provence regions. I'm not a big fan of Meg Ryan but this film compares to the warm, funny, romantic appeal that Sleepless in Seattle offered. Kevin Kline is this adorably macho French thief whose mission is to use the money from this stolen necklace to buy land to start a vineyard. Kate's goal conveyed since the beginning of the film is for her to "put down some roots and watch them grow". Coincidentally, it appears they have similar goals but do they ever discover this connection? We should also mention how wonderful the music is. After seeing this film, I immediately obtained a copy of the soundtrack. Although there are two renditions of "I Love Paris," they are both equally enjoyable. Kevin Kline sings a beautifully loungy song called "La Mer" in the film. It makes me sway and imagine that I'm in Paris hearing this at a caf&eacute; sipping some wine.

    I really don't know why I wanted to see this movie, but I think it is because the cover looked cool so I sought of put it onto my want to see list. It wasn't all that crash hot, more of what one would call a chick flick. I am not entirely against chick-flicks, but there are films that have style and films that don't, and I'm afraid that French Kiss doesn't. Basically this woman's fianc&eacute; goes to France and then decides that he will fall in love with a woman there and break off the engagement to her. She decides to go over there to try and patch up the marriage, but she isn't really allowed to leave until her citizenship comes through. She leaves anyway and when she looses everything, she cannot return because the Canadians don't want her and the Americans are offended that she would rather live in Canada than in America. Anyway, everything seems bad, but this one guy who is a petty thief decides to help her out to get her fianc&eacute; back, but one wonders why one would want a fianc&eacute; back when he dumped you for a woman he just met. She wants security and believes that this guy will give her security. What she needed to do though was learn to take risks. She really did not want to take any risks, she simply wanted back what was familiar, but soon comes to realise that the familiar is not all that worth it. So in the end she takes the risk and goes for the guy that she really did not know all that well and knew was a petty thief.

    Lawrence Kasdan's 'French Kiss' is a film, that offers Fair Entertainment. But if you take it too seriously and if you go inn with huge expectations, chances are you might come out with a frown. 'French Kiss' is a Romantic-Comedy, where A woman flies to France to confront her straying fianc&eacute;, but gets into trouble when the charming crook seated next to her, uses her for smuggling. Adam Brooks's Writing in the first hour is entertaining, and manages to hold your attention thoroughly. But, in the second hour, it falters, especially during it's finale. Though it comes up with a innovative idea to disclose it's final act, the impact seems to be missing. But, again, it doesn't really leave you angry or really disappointed. Lawrence Kasdan's direction is fair. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Meg Ryan is Excellent, and quite frankly delivers one of her finest performances in here. Kevin Kline as a Frenchman, gets his accent and pronunciation right, and entertains in the goings-on. Timothy Hutton is passable. Jean Reno is dependable, as always. Suzan Anbeh is alright. On the whole, Watch it on a Lazy Sunday After-Noon.

    I loved the music; the Beautiful South sang the tunes and that stuck with me as much as the movie; maybe even more. Dream a little Dream is a knock out, you will be singing all the next day. The film meshed so nicely with the story. For me it was a perfect blend of the two. A picture that Cary Grant would have been perfect with someone like Kerr or Hepburn. Saw it one Saturday on TV and perhaps not the ideal setting, but it is is a favorite boy meets girl love story. The plot is summarized as well as I've seen, here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Kiss_%28film%29 This is why if you've not seen it, you'll want to give it a chance.

    This is my favorite movie of all times!!! I love the scenery, photographs, clever dialogs, the performance is superb.... 10 out of 10. An ordinary topic with a twist... I can only congratulate the producer and director for making this movie something to remember for the rest of my days. It is quite funny and romantic, makes a person believe anything can happen. Locations encouraged me to fly to France and the 452 types of cheese will be stuck on my mind forever. Definitely number one on my list. You can watch it with friends or with a date to pass a good time! Also, soundtrack is awesome... ever since I watched this movie, Dream a little dream of me is my favorite romantic song. I wish someone would sing it to me someday. I sincerely don't understand why the low score...

    Possible spoiler..... Kevin Kline as a Frenchman? I was intrigued. And yes, he does it perfectly so far as I - not being French but having been there often - can ascertain. I see he was born in Missouri so I assume he must be bi-lingual? What a fun story! The reason I don't give this movie 9 is that the Canadian boyfriend's French interest doesn't get enough attention - it becomes clear eventually that she has "a story to tell" but we have only a hint of it and I found this frustrating. At first she seems just a ruthless bimbo- fianc&eacute;-snatcher, but when Kline's character talks to her we see she's far from that, truly is in love with the berk, she's not as young as she first seemed and she's certainly not objectionable at all - there's such a poignancy about her, very well acted, finally giving the actress a chance to show her quality yet in a few moments that scene's over and we learn no more. I immediately wanted to know more about her along with wondering why this intelligent girl was wasting herself on a twerp the actual heroine is clearly well rid of - so the French girl's past must explain this. Unfortunately the movie doesn't deliver on "the other woman" beyond this one brief moment, a major disappointment. On the other hand, she does it seems get what she was longing for, which is good. I'm not sure whether we're supposed to feel for the Canadian boyfriend, that he couldn't help changing his allegiance, or to despise him. I felt the actor wasn't sure which angle to put over, another reason for this movie failing for me to achieve 9 or 10. A mention though for the thief's policeman "friend" - a very good subplot. This movie's a "not to be missed", with a lot of laughs and a very engaging story line, enhanced by the fine French settings and a splendid finale. Notice the dress Meg Ryan is wearing in that last scene - so evocative, simply perfect........

    I really don't know why I wanted to see this movie, but I think it is because the cover looked cool so I sought of put it onto my want to see list. It wasn't all that crash hot, more of what one would call a chick flick. I am not entirely against chick-flicks, but there are films that have style and films that don't, and I'm afraid that French Kiss doesn't. Basically this woman's fianc&eacute; goes to France and then decides that he will fall in love with a woman there and break off the engagement to her. She decides to go over there to try and patch up the marriage, but she isn't really allowed to leave until her citizenship comes through. She leaves anyway and when she looses everything, she cannot return because the Canadians don't want her and the Americans are offended that she would rather live in Canada than in America. Anyway, everything seems bad, but this one guy who is a petty thief decides to help her out to get her fianc&eacute; back, but one wonders why one would want a fianc&eacute; back when he dumped you for a woman he just met. She wants security and believes that this guy will give her security. What she needed to do though was learn to take risks. She really did not want to take any risks, she simply wanted back what was familiar, but soon comes to realise that the familiar is not all that worth it. So in the end she takes the risk and goes for the guy that she really did not know all that well and knew was a petty thief.

    Lawrence Kasdan's 'French Kiss' is a film, that offers Fair Entertainment. But if you take it too seriously and if you go inn with huge expectations, chances are you might come out with a frown. 'French Kiss' is a Romantic-Comedy, where A woman flies to France to confront her straying fianc&eacute;, but gets into trouble when the charming crook seated next to her, uses her for smuggling. Adam Brooks's Writing in the first hour is entertaining, and manages to hold your attention thoroughly. But, in the second hour, it falters, especially during it's finale. Though it comes up with a innovative idea to disclose it's final act, the impact seems to be missing. But, again, it doesn't really leave you angry or really disappointed. Lawrence Kasdan's direction is fair. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Meg Ryan is Excellent, and quite frankly delivers one of her finest performances in here. Kevin Kline as a Frenchman, gets his accent and pronunciation right, and entertains in the goings-on. Timothy Hutton is passable. Jean Reno is dependable, as always. Suzan Anbeh is alright. On the whole, Watch it on a Lazy Sunday After-Noon.

    I loved the music; the Beautiful South sang the tunes and that stuck with me as much as the movie; maybe even more. Dream a little Dream is a knock out, you will be singing all the next day. The film meshed so nicely with the story. For me it was a perfect blend of the two. A picture that Cary Grant would have been perfect with someone like Kerr or Hepburn. Saw it one Saturday on TV and perhaps not the ideal setting, but it is is a favorite boy meets girl love story. The plot is summarized as well as I've seen, here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Kiss_%28film%29 This is why if you've not seen it, you'll want to give it a chance.

    This is my favorite movie of all times!!! I love the scenery, photographs, clever dialogs, the performance is superb.... 10 out of 10. An ordinary topic with a twist... I can only congratulate the producer and director for making this movie something to remember for the rest of my days. It is quite funny and romantic, makes a person believe anything can happen. Locations encouraged me to fly to France and the 452 types of cheese will be stuck on my mind forever. Definitely number one on my list. You can watch it with friends or with a date to pass a good time! Also, soundtrack is awesome... ever since I watched this movie, Dream a little dream of me is my favorite romantic song. I wish someone would sing it to me someday. I sincerely don't understand why the low score...

    Possible spoiler..... Kevin Kline as a Frenchman? I was intrigued. And yes, he does it perfectly so far as I - not being French but having been there often - can ascertain. I see he was born in Missouri so I assume he must be bi-lingual? What a fun story! The reason I don't give this movie 9 is that the Canadian boyfriend's French interest doesn't get enough attention - it becomes clear eventually that she has "a story to tell" but we have only a hint of it and I found this frustrating. At first she seems just a ruthless bimbo- fianc&eacute;-snatcher, but when Kline's character talks to her we see she's far from that, truly is in love with the berk, she's not as young as she first seemed and she's certainly not objectionable at all - there's such a poignancy about her, very well acted, finally giving the actress a chance to show her quality yet in a few moments that scene's over and we learn no more. I immediately wanted to know more about her along with wondering why this intelligent girl was wasting herself on a twerp the actual heroine is clearly well rid of - so the French girl's past must explain this. Unfortunately the movie doesn't deliver on "the other woman" beyond this one brief moment, a major disappointment. On the other hand, she does it seems get what she was longing for, which is good. I'm not sure whether we're supposed to feel for the Canadian boyfriend, that he couldn't help changing his allegiance, or to despise him. I felt the actor wasn't sure which angle to put over, another reason for this movie failing for me to achieve 9 or 10. A mention though for the thief's policeman "friend" - a very good subplot. This movie's a "not to be missed", with a lot of laughs and a very engaging story line, enhanced by the fine French settings and a splendid finale. Notice the dress Meg Ryan is wearing in that last scene - so evocative, simply perfect........

    "When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself, one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls romance." --Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Kate's (Meg Ryan) love-of-her-life, Charlie (Timothy Hutton) travels to France, where he meets his love-of-his-life, thereby leaving Kate. Misbegotten, forlorn, neurotic, rudderless Kate pursues Charlie to France, where she meets an all-new, all-French love-of-her-life, Luc (Kevin Kline). After unfathomably contrived and criminal adventures, Happily Ever After ensues. Kline as Luc is the only watchable thing in FRENCH KISS - besides the glorious Parisian backdrop. The great Jean Reno (LEON, 1992) plays a one-dimensional French cop who allows Luc to evding him because Luc savid hislife once; Hutton is a McGuffin and his high-thighed temptress merely a plot element. And Ryan is so ingenuously irritating and cloying and provincial and desperate and ugly it is no wonder she had that facelift that destroyed her face and career. Timothy Hutton's character does exactly the same thing Warren Beatty does in LOVE AFFAIR 1994 - finds "true love" on a trip abroad and leaves his current partner to pursue it. Yet this movie makes him the Bad Guy! Even though, like Beatty, he professes his new love is The Real Thing. But "true love" here is from the dumped partner's point of view: "...because my love is there with his slut girlfriend..." And true love to Kate is what she has been indoctrinated with in her immature Disney and Brady Bunch culture. She actually says: "I'm gonna get him back, and I'm gonna make him love me and we are gonna live happily ever after!" Free Will, emotions, hormones, pheromones, rationale, reality be damned. Kate meets Luc on the plane. He uses her to unknowingly smuggle a small grapevine into France. This redemptive gimmick only exists to cushion the blow of perceiving him as a one-dimensional thief - the "tender" side of Luc as he fawns over this vine sapling with which he aims to start a vineyard and Go Legit (of course, his idea of Legit is to illegitimately rip off anyone who could contribute towards his Legit Dream.) We are meant to harken back to this sapling again and again as Luc perpetrates criminal act after criminal act for the sake of "love" and his "dream." While in France, Kate gets her bag stolen, so Luc (at this point, her pseudo-beau) steals a car to recover her bag. But he's so SENSITIVE with that tender sapling and all... Luc is also in possession of a stolen bracelet - but there's that sapling thing... In trying to re-steal his necklace from another con-man, Luc steals a bike. How many people laughed at the owner of the bike running after Luc in fury? Answer: Everyone. Because that sapling, oh, that sapling, illustrating his nurturing and caring side... But all that stealing and low crime is simply to kill time while Luc and Kate fall for each other in Paris. Luc calls attention to the woman's "weapon" - the Pout - where she implies Yes when she means No and says No when she means Yes, leaving her suitor in a state of lustful disarray. How does this appraisal sit with all those High Court Judges and sleek-thighed, mini-skirted temptresses insisting that NoMeansNo? The same audience that laughed at all those wrongful deeds that Luc perpetrated are now faced with either agreeing with this summation of a woman's Asking For It, or dismissing it as film-maker's fancy. Kate is oblivious to the Eiffel Tower, continually missing glimpses of it, until her latent sexual feelings (euphemized in the film as "love") rise to the surface. Only when she realises she is "falling in love" does she notice that BIG PENIS. What we can learn from FRENCH KISS: bleary-eyed women will lament, "This is how a man should woo me!" (Yeah, be a criminal and steal things for me.) Men will view this pathetic farce as education, gleaning the angles women will fall for in The Cultivation. The most valuable lesson any man can learn from any Romantic Comedy is: Disguising the fact that the One Thing is prevalent in your mind, is the quickest way to get the One Thing. Movie ends with Luc and Kate strolling through that vaunted vineyard he committed all those crimes to attain. Legitimately, of course. Ain't love grand theft auto? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    Starring Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, and Timothy Hutton, this is a most enjoyable little film. If you can get past the first few minutes and bear another mousy-type and phobia-driven performance by Meg, this is a nice way to pass the time. In fact, her peculiarities make her character so real, one really understands and sympathizes with her and can put themselves in her position. Kline is very believable as a french man, and their chemistry comes off surprisingly well. The only reason I didn't give this more than a 6 is because, while it is charming and enjoyable, I couldn't help feeling that there are a whole lot more "romantic comedies" that "French Kiss" couldn't even compare to. This almost feels like a poor man's "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure.

    Kate and Charlie have a perfect life planned out before them. Buy a house, marriage, kids, the whole works. Kate's fear of flying keeps her in Canada while Charlie goes to Paris for a medical convention. While there Charlie falls for Juliette. He calls off the wedding with Kate and she nervously boards a plane to get him back. She ends up sitting next to French thief Luc. He hides a stolen necklace and smuggled grape vine in her bag to get it through customs. Her bag is stolen, the necklace apparently lost, and Kate and Luc head to Cannes, Luc to find the necklace and Kate get Charlie back. Along the way, Kate and Luc begin having feelings for each other, because this is what happened in every Meg Ryan Movie in the nineties...... If it wasn't for Kline or Reno, this would have gotten a two all the way, and if it were made today, I'm sure it'd star Katherine Heigl and just be as bland. Which is another way of saying that the film is as bland and as generic as romantic comedies can be, but with the added element of xenophobia. Ryan has never been more annoying, from her shouting for no reason at all, to her silly John Lennon style sunglasses, every scene in which see is in is annihilated, and there are plenty to choose from because she produced the blasted thing. It looks beautiful though, and as I've already said, I'll watch Kline read the phone book, but this really is the pits.

    I tried to find this film amusing. I know that Meg Ryan is not known for appearing in heavyweight philosophical flicks; productions with her name above the title are usually filed under "mildly pleasant pastimes that require little to no viewer engagement." Unbelievable plot? Check. Stupid "misunderstandings" that a seven-year-old would clear up with one question and one answer, but that drag on through the whole picture? Check. And yet again Ryan tries to trade in on her "perky girl-next- door fresh wholesome" cuteness. But in this light-as-air comedy, her performance descends into caricature, not character. All the well-known Ryan tics are there: the waving of the arms, the hand to the forehead signaling "Oh I don't believe this, poor me", the little sniffs and puffs that were part of the "cute little Missy" repertoire of the 80s have become an exaggerated near-parody in this film. We won't even discuss her over the top yelps about "mucus" and lactose intolerance (which is no laughing matter for those who actually suffer from it). I hate to tell the scriptwriter, but romantic emoting, even good sex, will not cure food allergies. We also won't discuss the anti-French culture memes in this script. How they convinced Jean Reno to work in this movie we will never know. I can watch just about any comedy on a Saturday afternoon, but this is one of those films that made me want those 90+ min of my life back. I sat through it hoping it would go somewhere, and the ending was so bad my companion and I just sat there staring at each other. "That's it? That's all?" The-the, the-the, the-that's all folks. I'd give it minus 5 out of 10 if I could.

    The story revolves around Kate (Meg Ryan), who is a school teacher living in Canada and engaged to marry Charlie (Timothy Hutton). Suddenly, Charlie travels to Paris on business and announces to Kate that he has decided to stay in Paris because he has fallen in love. Although Kate is extremely fearful of flying, she hops on a plane to Paris to get her Charlie back. On this flight, her seat-mate is Luc (Kevin Kline) who uses her to smuggle in a stolen diamond necklace. Upon arriving in Paris, Luc follows Kate because he has hidden the jewels in her backpack. The adventure continues when Luc proclaims that he can help her win her Charlie back. The duo travel from Paris to Cannes as Luc provides specific advice on how Kate should handle this situation and confront the Charlie and his new girlfriend. The dialogue is witty and fun as the film continues with a stop to visit Luc's family in the scenically appropriate French wine countryside. The banter between Luc and Kate throughout the film is clever and cute. Kate fills the movie with witty lines that become memorable because of her frustration with Luc. One of my favorite lines is when Kate tells Luc, "You'll become one of those hunchbacked, lonely old men, sitting in the corner of a crowded caf&eacute;, mumbling to yourself, 'My ass is twitching. You people make my ass twitch'". During their escapades, Luc becomes quite fond of Kate, even with her constant sarcastic remarks. This is a perfect romantic comedy about boy meets girl while trying to win another boy back. The scenes used in the film are vibrantly beautiful with locations which include Paris, Cannes and Provence regions. I'm not a big fan of Meg Ryan but this film compares to the warm, funny, romantic appeal that Sleepless in Seattle offered. Kevin Kline is this adorably macho French thief whose mission is to use the money from this stolen necklace to buy land to start a vineyard. Kate's goal conveyed since the beginning of the film is for her to "put down some roots and watch them grow". Coincidentally, it appears they have similar goals but do they ever discover this connection? We should also mention how wonderful the music is. After seeing this film, I immediately obtained a copy of the soundtrack. Although there are two renditions of "I Love Paris," they are both equally enjoyable. Kevin Kline sings a beautifully loungy song called "La Mer" in the film. It makes me sway and imagine that I'm in Paris hearing this at a caf&eacute; sipping some wine.

    "When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself, one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls romance." --Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Kate's (Meg Ryan) love-of-her-life, Charlie (Timothy Hutton) travels to France, where he meets his love-of-his-life, thereby leaving Kate.

    Starring Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, and Timothy Hutton, this is a most enjoyable little film. If you can get past the first few minutes and bear another mousy-type and phobia-driven performance by Meg, this is a nice way to pass the time. In fact, her peculiarities make her character so real, one really understands and sympathizes with her and can put themselves in her position. Kline is very believable as a french man, and their chemistry comes off surprisingly well. The only reason I didn't give this more than a 6 is because, while it is charming and enjoyable, I couldn't help feeling that there are a whole lot more "romantic comedies" that "French Kiss" couldn't even compare to. This almost feels like a poor man's "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure.

    Kate and Charlie have a perfect life planned out before them. Buy a house, marriage, kids, the whole works. Kate's fear of flying keeps her in Canada while Charlie goes to Paris for a medical convention. While there Charlie falls for Juliette. He calls off the wedding with Kate and she nervously boards a plane to get him back. She ends up sitting next to French thief Luc. He hides a stolen necklace and smuggled grape vine in her bag to get it through customs. Her bag is stolen, the necklace apparently lost, and Kate and Luc head to Cannes, Luc to find the necklace and Kate get Charlie back. Along the way, Kate and Luc begin having feelings for each other, because this is what happened in every Meg Ryan Movie in the nineties...... If it wasn't for Kline or Reno, this would have gotten a two all the way, and if it were made today, I'm sure it'd star Katherine Heigl and just be as bland. Which is another way of saying that the film is as bland and as generic as romantic comedies can be, but with the added element of xenophobia. Ryan has never been more annoying, from her shouting for no reason at all, to her silly John Lennon style sunglasses, every scene in which see is in is annihilated, and there are plenty to choose from because she produced the blasted thing. It looks beautiful though, and as I've already said, I'll watch Kline read the phone book, but this really is the pits.

    I tried to find this film amusing. I know that Meg Ryan is not known for appearing in heavyweight philosophical flicks; productions with her name above the title are usually filed under "mildly pleasant pastimes that require little to no viewer engagement." Unbelievable plot? Check. Stupid "misunderstandings" that a seven-year-old would clear up with one question and one answer, but that drag on through the whole picture? Check. And yet again Ryan tries to trade in on her "perky girl-next- door fresh wholesome" cuteness. But in this light-as-air comedy, her performance descends into caricature, not character. All the well-known Ryan tics are there: the waving of the arms, the hand to the forehead signaling "Oh I don't believe this, poor me", the little sniffs and puffs that were part of the "cute little Missy" repertoire of the 80s have become an exaggerated near-parody in this film. We won't even discuss her over the top yelps about "mucus" and lactose intolerance (which is no laughing matter for those who actually suffer from it). I hate to tell the scriptwriter, but romantic emoting, even good sex, will not cure food allergies. We also won't discuss the anti-French culture memes in this script. How they convinced Jean Reno to work in this movie we will never know. I can watch just about any comedy on a Saturday afternoon, but this is one of those films that made me want those 90+ min of my life back. I sat through it hoping it would go somewhere, and the ending was so bad my companion and I just sat there staring at each other. "That's it? That's all?" The-the, the-the, the-that's all folks. I'd give it minus 5 out of 10 if I could.

    The story revolves around Kate (Meg Ryan), who is a school teacher living in Canada and engaged to marry Charlie (Timothy Hutton). Suddenly, Charlie travels to Paris on business and announces to Kate that he has decided to stay in Paris because he has fallen in love. Although Kate is extremely fearful of flying, she hops on a plane to Paris to get her Charlie back. On this flight, her seat-mate is Luc (Kevin Kline) who uses her to smuggle in a stolen diamond necklace. Upon arriving in Paris, Luc follows Kate because he has hidden the jewels in her backpack. The adventure continues when Luc proclaims that he can help her win her Charlie back. The duo travel from Paris to Cannes as Luc provides specific advice on how Kate should handle this situation and confront the Charlie and his new girlfriend. The dialogue is witty and fun as the film continues with a stop to visit Luc's family in the scenically appropriate French wine countryside. The banter between Luc and Kate throughout the film is clever and cute. Kate fills the movie with witty lines that become memorable because of her frustration with Luc. One of my favorite lines is when Kate tells Luc, "You'll become one of those hunchbacked, lonely old men, sitting in the corner of a crowded caf&eacute;, mumbling to yourself, 'My ass is twitching. You people make my ass twitch'". During their escapades, Luc becomes quite fond of Kate, even with her constant sarcastic remarks. This is a perfect romantic comedy about boy meets girl while trying to win another boy back. The scenes used in the film are vibrantly beautiful with locations which include Paris, Cannes and Provence regions. I'm not a big fan of Meg Ryan but this film compares to the warm, funny, romantic appeal that Sleepless in Seattle offered. Kevin Kline is this adorably macho French thief whose mission is to use the money from this stolen necklace to buy land to start a vineyard. Kate's goal conveyed since the beginning of the film is for her to "put down some roots and watch them grow". Coincidentally, it appears they have similar goals but do they ever discover this connection? We should also mention how wonderful the music is. After seeing this film, I immediately obtained a copy of the soundtrack. Although there are two renditions of "I Love Paris," they are both equally enjoyable. Kevin Kline sings a beautifully loungy song called "La Mer" in the film. It makes me sway and imagine that I'm in Paris hearing this at a caf&eacute; sipping some wine.

    I really don't know why I wanted to see this movie, but I think it is because the cover looked cool so I sought of put it onto my want to see list. It wasn't all that crash hot, more of what one would call a chick flick. I am not entirely against chick-flicks, but there are films that have style and films that don't, and I'm afraid that French Kiss doesn't. Basically this woman's fianc&eacute; goes to France and then decides that he will fall in love with a woman there and break off the engagement to her. She decides to go over there to try and patch up the marriage, but she isn't really allowed to leave until her citizenship comes through. She leaves anyway and when she looses everything, she cannot return because the Canadians don't want her and the Americans are offended that she would rather live in Canada than in America. Anyway, everything seems bad, but this one guy who is a petty thief decides to help her out to get her fianc&eacute; back, but one wonders why one would want a fianc&eacute; back when he dumped you for a woman he just met. She wants security and believes that this guy will give her security. What she needed to do though was learn to take risks. She really did not want to take any risks, she simply wanted back what was familiar, but soon comes to realise that the familiar is not all that worth it. So in the end she takes the risk and goes for the guy that she really did not know all that well and knew was a petty thief.

    Lawrence Kasdan's 'French Kiss' is a film, that offers Fair Entertainment. But if you take it too seriously and if you go inn with huge expectations, chances are you might come out with a frown. 'French Kiss' is a Romantic-Comedy, where A woman flies to France to confront her straying fianc&eacute;, but gets into trouble when the charming crook seated next to her, uses her for smuggling. Adam Brooks's Writing in the first hour is entertaining, and manages to hold your attention thoroughly. But, in the second hour, it falters, especially during it's finale. Though it comes up with a innovative idea to disclose it's final act, the impact seems to be missing. But, again, it doesn't really leave you angry or really disappointed. Lawrence Kasdan's direction is fair. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Meg Ryan is Excellent, and quite frankly delivers one of her finest performances in here. Kevin Kline as a Frenchman, gets his accent and pronunciation right, and entertains in the goings-on. Timothy Hutton is passable. Jean Reno is dependable, as always. Suzan Anbeh is alright. On the whole, Watch it on a Lazy Sunday After-Noon.

    I loved the music; the Beautiful South sang the tunes and that stuck with me as much as the movie; maybe even more. Dream a little Dream is a knock out, you will be singing all the next day. The film meshed so nicely with the story. For me it was a perfect blend of the two. A picture that Cary Grant would have been perfect with someone like Kerr or Hepburn. Saw it one Saturday on TV and perhaps not the ideal setting, but it is is a favorite boy meets girl love story. The plot is summarized as well as I've seen, here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Kiss_%28film%29 This is why if you've not seen it, you'll want to give it a chance.

    This is my favorite movie of all times!!! I love the scenery, photographs, clever dialogs, the performance is superb.... 10 out of 10. An ordinary topic with a twist... I can only congratulate the producer and director for making this movie something to remember for the rest of my days. It is quite funny and romantic, makes a person believe anything can happen. Locations encouraged me to fly to France and the 452 types of cheese will be stuck on my mind forever. Definitely number one on my list. You can watch it with friends or with a date to pass a good time! Also, soundtrack is awesome... ever since I watched this movie, Dream a little dream of me is my favorite romantic song. I wish someone would sing it to me someday. I sincerely don't understand why the low score...

    Possible spoiler..... Kevin Kline as a Frenchman? I was intrigued. And yes, he does it perfectly so far as I - not being French but having been there often - can ascertain. I see he was born in Missouri so I assume he must be bi-lingual? What a fun story! The reason I don't give this movie 9 is that the Canadian boyfriend's French interest doesn't get enough attention - it becomes clear eventually that she has "a story to tell" but we have only a hint of it and I found this frustrating. At first she seems just a ruthless bimbo- fianc&eacute;-snatcher, but when Kline's character talks to her we see she's far from that, truly is in love with the berk, she's not as young as she first seemed and she's certainly not objectionable at all - there's such a poignancy about her, very well acted, finally giving the actress a chance to show her quality yet in a few moments that scene's over and we learn no more. I immediately wanted to know more about her along with wondering why this intelligent girl was wasting herself on a twerp the actual heroine is clearly well rid of - so the French girl's past must explain this. Unfortunately the movie doesn't deliver on "the other woman" beyond this one brief moment, a major disappointment. On the other hand, she does it seems get what she was longing for, which is good. I'm not sure whether we're supposed to feel for the Canadian boyfriend, that he couldn't help changing his allegiance, or to despise him. I felt the actor wasn't sure which angle to put over, another reason for this movie failing for me to achieve 9 or 10. A mention though for the thief's policeman "friend" - a very good subplot. This movie's a "not to be missed", with a lot of laughs and a very engaging story line, enhanced by the fine French settings and a splendid finale. Notice the dress Meg Ryan is wearing in that last scene - so evocative, simply perfect........

    "When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself, one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls romance." --Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Kate's (Meg Ryan) love-of-her-life, Charlie (Timothy Hutton) travels to France, where he meets his love-of-his-life, thereby leaving Kate. Misbegotten, forlorn, neurotic, rudderless Kate pursues Charlie to France, where she meets an all-new, all-French love-of-her-life, Luc (Kevin Kline). After unfathomably contrived and criminal adventures, Happily Ever After ensues. Kline as Luc is the only watchable thing in FRENCH KISS - besides the glorious Parisian backdrop. The great Jean Reno (LEON, 1992) plays a one-dimensional French cop who allows Luc to evding him because Luc savid hislife once; Hutton is a McGuffin and his high-thighed temptress merely a plot element. And Ryan is so ingenuously irritating and cloying and provincial and desperate and ugly it is no wonder she had that facelift that destroyed her face and career. Timothy Hutton's character does exactly the same thing Warren Beatty does in LOVE AFFAIR 1994 - finds "true love" on a trip abroad and leaves his current partner to pursue it. Yet this movie makes him the Bad Guy! Even though, like Beatty, he professes his new love is The Real Thing. But "true love" here is from the dumped partner's point of view: "...because my love is there with his slut girlfriend..." And true love to Kate is what she has been indoctrinated with in her immature Disney and Brady Bunch culture. She actually says: "I'm gonna get him back, and I'm gonna make him love me and we are gonna live happily ever after!" Free Will, emotions, hormones, pheromones, rationale, reality be damned. Kate meets Luc on the plane. He uses her to unknowingly smuggle a small grapevine into France. This redemptive gimmick only exists to cushion the blow of perceiving him as a one-dimensional thief - the "tender" side of Luc as he fawns over this vine sapling with which he aims to start a vineyard and Go Legit (of course, his idea of Legit is to illegitimately rip off anyone who could contribute towards his Legit Dream.) We are meant to harken back to this sapling again and again as Luc perpetrates criminal act after criminal act for the sake of "love" and his "dream." While in France, Kate gets her bag stolen, so Luc (at this point, her pseudo-beau) steals a car to recover her bag. But he's so SENSITIVE with that tender sapling and all... Luc is also in possession of a stolen bracelet - but there's that sapling thing... In trying to re-steal his necklace from another con-man, Luc steals a bike. How many people laughed at the owner of the bike running after Luc in fury? Answer: Everyone. Because that sapling, oh, that sapling, illustrating his nurturing and caring side... But all that stealing and low crime is simply to kill time while Luc and Kate fall for each other in Paris. Luc calls attention to the woman's "weapon" - the Pout - where she implies Yes when she means No and says No when she means Yes, leaving her suitor in a state of lustful disarray. How does this appraisal sit with all those High Court Judges and sleek-thighed, mini-skirted temptresses insisting that NoMeansNo? The same audience that laughed at all those wrongful deeds that Luc perpetrated are now faced with either agreeing with this summation of a woman's Asking For It, or dismissing it as film-maker's fancy. Kate is oblivious to the Eiffel Tower, continually missing glimpses of it, until her latent sexual feelings (euphemized in the film as "love") rise to the surface. Only when she realises she is "falling in love" does she notice that BIG PENIS. What we can learn from FRENCH KISS: bleary-eyed women will lament, "This is how a man should woo me!" (Yeah, be a criminal and steal things for me.) Men will view this pathetic farce as education, gleaning the angles women will fall for in The Cultivation. The most valuable lesson any man can learn from any Romantic Comedy is: Disguising the fact that the One Thing is prevalent in your mind, is the quickest way to get the One Thing. Movie ends with Luc and Kate strolling through that vaunted vineyard he committed all those crimes to attain. Legitimately, of course. Ain't love grand theft auto? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

Locations encouraged me to fly to France and the 452 types of cheese will be stuck on my mind forever. Definitely number one on my list. You can watch it with friends or with a date to pass a good time! Also, soundtrack is awesome... ever since I watched this movie, Dream a little dream of me is my favorite romantic song. I wish someone would sing it to me someday. I sincerely don't understand why the low score...

    Possible spoiler..... Kevin Kline as a Frenchman? I was intrigued. And yes, he does it perfectly so far as I - not being French but having been there often - can ascertain. I see he was born in Missouri so I assume he must be bi-lingual? What a fun story! The reason I don't give this movie 9 is that the Canadian boyfriend's French interest doesn't get enough attention - it becomes clear eventually that she has "a story to tell" but we have only a hint of it and I found this frustrating. At first she seems just a ruthless bimbo- fianc&eacute;-snatcher, but when Kline's character talks to her we see she's far from that, truly is in love with the berk, she's not as young as she first seemed and she's certainly not objectionable at all - there's such a poignancy about her, very well acted, finally giving the actress a chance to show her quality yet in a few moments that scene's over and we learn no more. I immediately wanted to know more about her along with wondering why this intelligent girl was wasting herself on a twerp the actual heroine is clearly well rid of - so the French girl's past must explain this. Unfortunately the movie doesn't deliver on "the other woman" beyond this one brief moment, a major disappointment. On the other hand, she does it seems get what she was longing for, which is good. I'm not sure whether we're supposed to feel for the Canadian boyfriend, that he couldn't help changing his allegiance, or to despise him. I felt the actor wasn't sure which angle to put over, another reason for this movie failing for me to achieve 9 or 10. A mention though for the thief's policeman "friend" - a very good subplot. This movie's a "not to be missed", with a lot of laughs and a very engaging story line, enhanced by the fine French settings and a splendid finale. Notice the dress Meg Ryan is wearing in that last scene - so evocative, simply perfect........

    "When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself, one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls romance." --Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Kate's (Meg Ryan) love-of-her-life, Charlie (Timothy Hutton) travels to France, where he meets his love-of-his-life, thereby leaving Kate. Misbegotten, forlorn, neurotic, rudderless Kate pursues Charlie to France, where she meets an all-new, all-French love-of-her-life, Luc (Kevin Kline). After unfathomably contrived and criminal adventures, Happily Ever After ensues. Kline as Luc is the only watchable thing in FRENCH KISS - besides the glorious Parisian backdrop. The great Jean Reno (LEON, 1992) plays a one-dimensional French cop who allows Luc to evding him because Luc savid hislife once; Hutton is a McGuffin and his high-thighed temptress merely a plot element. And Ryan is so ingenuously irritating and cloying and provincial and desperate and ugly it is no wonder she had that facelift that destroyed her face and career. Timothy Hutton's character does exactly the same thing Warren Beatty does in LOVE AFFAIR 1994 - finds "true love" on a trip abroad and leaves his current partner to pursue it. Yet this movie makes him the Bad Guy! Even though, like Beatty, he professes his new love is The Real Thing. But "true love" here is from the dumped partner's point of view: "...because my love is there with his slut girlfriend..." And true love to Kate is what she has been indoctrinated with in her immature Disney and Brady Bunch culture. She actually says: "I'm gonna get him back, and I'm gonna make him love me and we are gonna live happily ever after!" Free Will, emotions, hormones, pheromones, rationale, reality be damned. Kate meets Luc on the plane. He uses her to unknowingly smuggle a small grapevine into France. This redemptive gimmick only exists to cushion the blow of perceiving him as a one-dimensional thief - the "tender" side of Luc as he fawns over this vine sapling with which he aims to start a vineyard and Go Legit (of course, his idea of Legit is to illegitimately rip off anyone who could contribute towards his Legit Dream.) We are meant to harken back to this sapling again and again as Luc perpetrates criminal act after criminal act for the sake of "love" and his "dream." While in France, Kate gets her bag stolen, so Luc (at this point, her pseudo-beau) steals a car to recover her bag. But he's so SENSITIVE with that tender sapling and all... Luc is also in possession of a stolen bracelet - but there's that sapling thing... In trying to re-steal his necklace from another con-man, Luc steals a bike. How many people laughed at the owner of the bike running after Luc in fury? Answer: Everyone. Because that sapling, oh, that sapling, illustrating his nurturing and caring side... But all that stealing and low crime is simply to kill time while Luc and Kate fall for each other in Paris. Luc calls attention to the woman's "weapon" - the Pout - where she implies Yes when she means No and says No when she means Yes, leaving her suitor in a state of lustful disarray. How does this appraisal sit with all those High Court Judges and sleek-thighed, mini-skirted temptresses insisting that NoMeansNo? The same audience that laughed at all those wrongful deeds that Luc perpetrated are now faced with either agreeing with this summation of a woman's Asking For It, or dismissing it as film-maker's fancy. Kate is oblivious to the Eiffel Tower, continually missing glimpses of it, until her latent sexual feelings (euphemized in the film as "love") rise to the surface. Only when she realises she is "falling in love" does she notice that BIG PENIS. What we can learn from FRENCH KISS: bleary-eyed women will lament, "This is how a man should woo me!" (Yeah, be a criminal and steal things for me.) Men will view this pathetic farce as education, gleaning the angles women will fall for in The Cultivation. The most valuable lesson any man can learn from any Romantic Comedy is: Disguising the fact that the One Thing is prevalent in your mind, is the quickest way to get the One Thing. Movie ends with Luc and Kate strolling through that vaunted vineyard he committed all those crimes to attain. Legitimately, of course. Ain't love grand theft auto? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    Starring Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, and Timothy Hutton, this is a most enjoyable little film. If you can get past the first few minutes and bear another mousy-type and phobia-driven performance by Meg, this is a nice way to pass the time. In fact, her peculiarities make her character so real, one really understands and sympathizes with her and can put themselves in her position. Kline is very believable as a french man, and their chemistry comes off surprisingly well. The only reason I didn't give this more than a 6 is because, while it is charming and enjoyable, I couldn't help feeling that there are a whole lot more "romantic comedies" that "French Kiss" couldn't even compare to. This almost feels like a poor man's "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure.
