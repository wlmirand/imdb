 <sinopse>
  Jerry Lundegaard's inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Jerry works in his father-in-law's car dealership and has gotten himself in financial problems. He tries various schemes to come up with money needed for a reason that is never really explained. It has to be assumed that his huge embezzlement of money from the dealership is about to be discovered by father-in-law. When all else falls through, plans he set in motion earlier for two men to kidnap his wife for ransom to be paid by her wealthy father (who doesn't seem to have the time of day for son-in-law). From the moment of the kidnapping, things go wrong and what was supposed to be a non-violent affair turns bloody with more blood added by the minute. Jerry is upset at the bloodshed, which turns loose a pregnant sheriff from Brainerd, MN who is tenacious in attempting to solve the three murders in her jurisdiction.

    No matter where you start to explain Fargo, it's hard to begin anywhere without "original" being present in the definition. The Coen Brothers constructed interesting films before Fargo, but this is what really pushed them to the top of the movie world "food chain" per se and established them as landmark filmmakers. The editing, directing, and writing is molded with a specific vision that is fulfilled on screen. The funny one-liners, repetition amongst characters, and the squeaking accents do draw laughs, but they hardly do justice for the film's originality and brilliance. It's a relatively ordinary setting and characters that are stretched out into a plot that would goes under the microscope and explored in the story in more detail than most films would for this simple set up. Then, once the Coens supply a huge shell to fill with a story, they form a bizarre, satisfying storyline that grows its own mind after taking off in Act 1. A misconception that viewers have about the cinematography of movies is the mise-en-scene has to be visually beautiful, assumed to be found in fantasy films and period pieces. Fargo covers territory of regular landscapes and they are beautiful in themselves, but each shot is thought up and executed to carefully capture something specific. When the cinematography is matched with the near-perfect editing, masterful mise-en-scene results. The supporting characters in Fargo think they have the simple situations they create under control, but the only character who really has a clue is the protagonist (introduced in an unconventional manner), splendidly created by Frances McDormand. In every performance by an actor in film, though all creatively their own, traces from past films often inspire the actors to make certain choices. In the skin of Marge, McDormand doesn't rely on inspiration, she relies on her own creativity. Every character is appropriately acted and drawn out to their full potential, I'm satisfied with everyone's development. William H. Macy humanizes his questionable character with quality to note. I've seen Fargo a good number of times, I've always been aware that it's a great, original film, but I never lived it as I did this past viewing. What other film could you sit through a storyline rooted in stupidity besides Fargo? Rating: 10 Grade: A+

    This is basically Coen brothers classic breakthrough film. And the story is superbly put together and crafted so well. To the point it makes it one of the top crime films that is a must watch. It's a serious crime story shown in a subtle and yet engaging manner, with slight awkward humor in it. But still stays consistent as a cold story about greed and the distances some people would go for their ambitions. Like the incompetence of the criminals and how it leads them from one mistake to another, one trouble to another. And innocent people gets involved one after another, because of dumb ideas. However, although this story takes place in a dry and boring snowy town. It's kinda amazing how the Coen brothers could pull off naive and dense characters that are actually still believable, while also entertaining to watch. And when it comes down to it, the mannerisms and the demeanor of the characters is what really drives this movie. And the Coen brothers just nails and makes these awkward characters to be intriguing, because of the random and yet believable decisions they make. This is one of those movies that could have fell flat, but thanks to Coen brothers trademark directions. Thus it's amusing and even intriguing at times, because of the random and yet witty and clever storytelling. Overall this is a film with a dry and boring setting, with awkward and yet dull characters that is really worth seeing. 8.6/10

    Marge Gunderson's pregnancy is seldom acknowledged in "Fargo," but a critical review almost has to mention it. It's a notable fact because, in moviedom, pregnancies are usually used symbolically or to raise the stakes. Audiences may react more strongly to things that happen to a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman, and screenwriters can generate quick, cheap pathos with a childbirth scene. But that's not what Joel and Ethan Coen do in "Fargo", and viewers may be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that the heroine is pregnant at all. It is only referenced lightly and in passing: a sight gag about how much buffet food she's eating, for example, or a tossed-off pretense for her to take a seat across from a potential suspect. The pregnancy doesn't limit her ability to do police work, and it doesn't mark her as undesirable to a man who wants to rekindle an old relationship. It may as well not be there, but it is there, and that makes it an interesting decision by the brothers Coen, who have too keen eyes for details to have done it absentmindedly. By rejecting the typical purposes of pregnancy in film, they show, perhaps, that it need have no special meaning; Marge is a cop investigating a triple homicide in a small Midwestern town, and that's all we really need to know. Whether she's pregnant or drinks coffee or eats eggs are just details.

    Evil as depicted in films such as "Fargo" and "Badlands" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In "Fargo" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over "a little bit of money" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are "doing pretty good" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying. This is a depiction of humankind at their worst and their best. It is a roller-coaster ride and possibly the best film ever made. And the score is just brilliant.

    OK. So this opens with a claim that it's based on a true story - supposedly actual events that occurred in Minnesota in 1987. But it turns out that the Coen brothers (directors Joel and Ethan) were lying. This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny. To be honest I'd have been upset with myself for being so amused by a movie that featured so much carnage if it actually had been true! The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) - the kidnapping having been planned by her husband Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry's in some sort of financial bind - although it's never really explained what the bind is. He needs money, and to get it he arranges for his wife's kidnapping so that his wealthy father-in- law will pay a ransom, which will then be split between the kidnappers and Jerry. Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic. This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota. Yaaaah. That was funny fer sher. Yaaaah. I forgive the Coen brothers. It's actually good that this wasn't really based on a true story. It makes the movie easier to laugh at. (7/10).

    So Argo has no major stars and well known stars still the film shines and gave the actors some reputation in the film business and respect. And the most important job was for the director Joel Coen who had chosen great actors for their role was brilliant and mind-blowing like William H. Macy who played Jerry Lundegaard a car's salesman manager own by his father in law in Minnesota and wanted to start a new businese and has a lack amount of sums to start on a businese and planned to pay 40,000 and a car to Carl Snowalter played by Steve Buscemi and Gaear Grimsrud played by Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife and ask his father in law 1 million dollars. Steve Buscemi played a delightful and a strong role and it was his ever the best role in this film and the energy of his speech delivery was unbelievably done and had matched the character correctly and lastly for Peter Stormare's role was much mature and he really got so in to the role that it was like its his real life attitude and I was so great full to watch this film it's a mind-blowing crime classic that I ever watch.And if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it and It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness.

    This is probably one of the most bittersweet pictures I've seen. Bitter, because I always felt it's a rather bleak and disturbing affair, but rendered sweet thanks to the colorful group of characters and their amusing banter (which is nicely emphasized with all those accents they have there, don'tcha know?). Parts of this film are pretty amusing, but parts of it are pretty sad. The whole affair is a funny-but-sad case. This story is pieced together from a couple of real-life cases, but populated with fictional characters. It's a pretty simple set-up: a man arranges to have his own wife kidnapped, hoping to weasel money from her father in the form of a ransom. What should be a simple and painless situation becomes a total disaster, because nearly every character thinks they know what they're doing and they think they're so hot, but they're all really inept. A series of mishaps and bad decisions causes a cascade of murders and a rather tragic outcome. Well, heck, the final scene is one of the bloodiest and messed-up things conceivable. As crazy and funny as it is to see things deteriorate over stupid mistakes, it is a sobering reflection on crime, greed, and humanity overall. I think the cop sums it up well at the end, for after running through the situation, she asks, "and for what? For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Dontcha know that?" All that being said, I feel the story does take one too many random tangents. A lot of screen time is spent on the cop's personal life, which never really has much relevance to the case. I suppose it's perfect for showing a little more humanity on screen, and to contrast directly with the other guy's family. However, I do believe these extraneous scenes slow down the pacing a lot, and sidetracks from the main story. This film has good, straightforward photography and editing. Acting is effectively perfect from the whole cast, and the writing is good. This production uses very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Carter Burwell's music score is haunting, dramatic, and beautiful all at once. This film has garnered its share of acclaim for darn good reasons. I always believed it could be a tighter film, but it is still well worth seeing for its great cast, its distinctive dialogue (complete with accents), and its ability to instill feelings of amusement and sorrow. Recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    The Coen brothers really deliver this time with Fargo, a murder story with quirky overtones and a flawless script that really sells the character interaction in an otherworld reality of sorts. Don't write the acting off for no 'big names', the actors all play their roles to perfection and sell the script with their excellent delivery of at times almost comical lines that still fit in with the dark drama atmosphere which gives it an undeniable creep factor. Stripped down Fargo is still a crime drama but it is one done right. With stellar acting and a script to match it adds a quirky creep to the dark story. Everything fits together in a world unfamiliar yet normal in this homespun murder story.

    Fargo is a film a film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is about the a very simple crime going horribly wrong. The film opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, entering into an arrangement with Carl Showalter, played by Steve Buscemi, and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Peter Stormare. The arrangement is for Carl and Gaear to abduct Jerry's wife, Jean, and hold her for ransom. The deal is supposed to involve no violence, and they are told they will get $40,000 in addition to a brand new vehicle. This should be a fairly simple plan, as Jean's father clearly has the means to pay the ransom, but this simple plan goes horribly wrong. This movie, as almost all, has multiple themes. Jerry's problems all develop due to his spinelessness, ineffectiveness, and general inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions. One of the themes of the film is that there are consequences of hiding sin. Jerry has a serious embezzling problem, and frankly it is never explained where he is spending this enormous sum of money. The movie elaborate that he is in immediate need of at least $320,000 due to GMAC discovering money he stole. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he constructs this insane plan to have Carl and Gaear kidnap his wife and hold her hostage to get his father-in-law's money. Jerry is so ineffective that he doesn't even show up on-time for his meeting with Carl and Gaear. Instead of admitting to his father-in-law that he stole $320,000, he tries to arrange a real-estate deal with him. Instead of planning through this business deal properly, his father-in-law assumes Jerry just wants a finder's fee for bringing the deal to him. This is further proof of Jerry's extreme spinelessness and ineptness Jerry is so incompetent that he fails to talk his father out of dropping off the money to the kidnappers. This is a disastrous consequence that results from the fact that he is concealing the theft of the money and his plan to cover up the theft. Jerry's entire plan for the crime was to take $1 million from his father-in-law, and give the kidnappers he hired $80,000. This idea is completely ruined when his father-in-law takes the money to the kidnappers instead of Jerry. Jerry further causes pain by ineptly allowing Wade to go through with this. The consequence of this is that Wade is killed by Carl, and an innocent parking lot attendant. These are direct consequences of Jerry being a bungling fool. The further theme of the film is that sin quickly escalates into greater sin. Carl and Gaear are engaged in the crime of kidnapping Jerry's wife, and they quickly escalate this. The initial choice to take part in this evil activity causes a state trooper to stop them. Gaear then kills the state trooper, but there are witnesses to this that unluckily decided to drive by at the wrong time. Gaear then kills those witnesses. Thus, what starts as a simple non-violent abduction turns into a triple homicide. This is just the beginning of the cycle. The triple homicide creates further despair when Carl kills Wade and the parking lot attendant. This shows the continuing cycle of crime creating more crime. The cycle continues when Gaear kills Jerry's wife and Carl. This cycle of crime creating more crime doesn't stop until Marge, a police officer, confronts Gaear as he is stuffing Carl into a wood chipper. Overall, this film is quite strong. It shows a superior effort went into the film. It is very effective at conveying its message. It is well directed, well edited, and highly effective. On the negative side, I question the point of hiding Jerry's motive for stealing all of this money. Explaining his scheme to steal money from GMAC would also be appreciated. This film is only 98 minutes long, and thus, has more than sufficient time to explain Jerry's motive for stealing this money. I do not see how this helps accomplish the film's ultimate intent. Other than that, I would say it is a very strong film. Overall, I would rate it a 9 out of 10.

    So Argo has no major stars and well known stars still the film shines and gave the actors some reputation in the film business and respect. And the most important job was for the director Joel Coen who had chosen great actors for their role was brilliant and mind-blowing like William H. Macy who played Jerry Lundegaard a car's salesman manager own by his father in law in Minnesota and wanted to start a new businese and has a lack amount of sums to start on a businese and planned to pay 40,000 and a car to Carl Snowalter played by Steve Buscemi and Gaear Grimsrud played by Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife and ask his father in law 1 million dollars. Steve Buscemi played a delightful and a strong role and it was his ever the best role in this film and the energy of his speech delivery was unbelievably done and had matched the character correctly and lastly for Peter Stormare's role was much mature and he really got so in to the role that it was like its his real life attitude and I was so great full to watch this film it's a mind-blowing crime classic that I ever watch.And if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it and It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness.

    This is probably one of the most bittersweet pictures I've seen. Bitter, because I always felt it's a rather bleak and disturbing affair, but rendered sweet thanks to the colorful group of characters and their amusing banter (which is nicely emphasized with all those accents they have there, don'tcha know?). Parts of this film are pretty amusing, but parts of it are pretty sad. The whole affair is a funny-but-sad case. This story is pieced together from a couple of real-life cases, but populated with fictional characters. It's a pretty simple set-up: a man arranges to have his own wife kidnapped, hoping to weasel money from her father in the form of a ransom. What should be a simple and painless situation becomes a total disaster, because nearly every character thinks they know what they're doing and they think they're so hot, but they're all really inept. A series of mishaps and bad decisions causes a cascade of murders and a rather tragic outcome. Well, heck, the final scene is one of the bloodiest and messed-up things conceivable. As crazy and funny as it is to see things deteriorate over stupid mistakes, it is a sobering reflection on crime, greed, and humanity overall. I think the cop sums it up well at the end, for after running through the situation, she asks, "and for what? For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Dontcha know that?" All that being said, I feel the story does take one too many random tangents. A lot of screen time is spent on the cop's personal life, which never really has much relevance to the case. I suppose it's perfect for showing a little more humanity on screen, and to contrast directly with the other guy's family. However, I do believe these extraneous scenes slow down the pacing a lot, and sidetracks from the main story. This film has good, straightforward photography and editing. Acting is effectively perfect from the whole cast, and the writing is good. This production uses very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Carter Burwell's music score is haunting, dramatic, and beautiful all at once. This film has garnered its share of acclaim for darn good reasons. I always believed it could be a tighter film, but it is still well worth seeing for its great cast, its distinctive dialogue (complete with accents), and its ability to instill feelings of amusement and sorrow. Recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    The Coen brothers really deliver this time with Fargo, a murder story with quirky overtones and a flawless script that really sells the character interaction in an otherworld reality of sorts. Don't write the acting off for no 'big names', the actors all play their roles to perfection and sell the script with their excellent delivery of at times almost comical lines that still fit in with the dark drama atmosphere which gives it an undeniable creep factor. Stripped down Fargo is still a crime drama but it is one done right. With stellar acting and a script to match it adds a quirky creep to the dark story. Everything fits together in a world unfamiliar yet normal in this homespun murder story.

    Fargo is a film a film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is about the a very simple crime going horribly wrong. The film opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, entering into an arrangement with Carl Showalter, played by Steve Buscemi, and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Peter Stormare. The arrangement is for Carl and Gaear to abduct Jerry's wife, Jean, and hold her for ransom. The deal is supposed to involve no violence, and they are told they will get $40,000 in addition to a brand new vehicle. This should be a fairly simple plan, as Jean's father clearly has the means to pay the ransom, but this simple plan goes horribly wrong. This movie, as almost all, has multiple themes. Jerry's problems all develop due to his spinelessness, ineffectiveness, and general inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions. One of the themes of the film is that there are consequences of hiding sin. Jerry has a serious embezzling problem, and frankly it is never explained where he is spending this enormous sum of money. The movie elaborate that he is in immediate need of at least $320,000 due to GMAC discovering money he stole. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he constructs this insane plan to have Carl and Gaear kidnap his wife and hold her hostage to get his father-in-law's money. Jerry is so ineffective that he doesn't even show up on-time for his meeting with Carl and Gaear. Instead of admitting to his father-in-law that he stole $320,000, he tries to arrange a real-estate deal with him. Instead of planning through this business deal properly, his father-in-law assumes Jerry just wants a finder's fee for bringing the deal to him. This is further proof of Jerry's extreme spinelessness and ineptness Jerry is so incompetent that he fails to talk his father out of dropping off the money to the kidnappers. This is a disastrous consequence that results from the fact that he is concealing the theft of the money and his plan to cover up the theft. Jerry's entire plan for the crime was to take $1 million from his father-in-law, and give the kidnappers he hired $80,000. This idea is completely ruined when his father-in-law takes the money to the kidnappers instead of Jerry. Jerry further causes pain by ineptly allowing Wade to go through with this. The consequence of this is that Wade is killed by Carl, and an innocent parking lot attendant. These are direct consequences of Jerry being a bungling fool. The further theme of the film is that sin quickly escalates into greater sin. Carl and Gaear are engaged in the crime of kidnapping Jerry's wife, and they quickly escalate this. The initial choice to take part in this evil activity causes a state trooper to stop them. Gaear then kills the state trooper, but there are witnesses to this that unluckily decided to drive by at the wrong time. Gaear then kills those witnesses. Thus, what starts as a simple non-violent abduction turns into a triple homicide. This is just the beginning of the cycle. The triple homicide creates further despair when Carl kills Wade and the parking lot attendant. This shows the continuing cycle of crime creating more crime. The cycle continues when Gaear kills Jerry's wife and Carl. This cycle of crime creating more crime doesn't stop until Marge, a police officer, confronts Gaear as he is stuffing Carl into a wood chipper. Overall, this film is quite strong. It shows a superior effort went into the film. It is very effective at conveying its message. It is well directed, well edited, and highly effective. On the negative side, I question the point of hiding Jerry's motive for stealing all of this money. Explaining his scheme to steal money from GMAC would also be appreciated. This film is only 98 minutes long, and thus, has more than sufficient time to explain Jerry's motive for stealing this money. I do not see how this helps accomplish the film's ultimate intent. Other than that, I would say it is a very strong film. Overall, I would rate it a 9 out of 10.

    No matter where you start to explain Fargo, it's hard to begin anywhere without "original" being present in the definition. The Coen Brothers constructed interesting films before Fargo, but this is what really pushed them to the top of the movie world "food chain" per se and established them as landmark filmmakers. The editing, directing, and writing is molded with a specific vision that is fulfilled on screen. The funny one-liners, repetition amongst characters, and the squeaking accents do draw laughs, but they hardly do justice for the film's originality and brilliance. It's a relatively ordinary setting and characters that are stretched out into a plot that would goes under the microscope and explored in the story in more detail than most films would for this simple set up. Then, once the Coens supply a huge shell to fill with a story, they form a bizarre, satisfying storyline that grows its own mind after taking off in Act 1. A misconception that viewers have about the cinematography of movies is the mise-en-scene has to be visually beautiful, assumed to be found in fantasy films and period pieces. Fargo covers territory of regular landscapes and they are beautiful in themselves, but each shot is thought up and executed to carefully capture something specific. When the cinematography is matched with the near-perfect editing, masterful mise-en-scene results. The supporting characters in Fargo think they have the simple situations they create under control, but the only character who really has a clue is the protagonist (introduced in an unconventional manner), splendidly created by Frances McDormand. In every performance by an actor in film, though all creatively their own, traces from past films often inspire the actors to make certain choices. In the skin of Marge, McDormand doesn't rely on inspiration, she relies on her own creativity. Every character is appropriately acted and drawn out to their full potential, I'm satisfied with everyone's development. William H. Macy humanizes his questionable character with quality to note. I've seen Fargo a good number of times, I've always been aware that it's a great, original film, but I never lived it as I did this past viewing. What other film could you sit through a storyline rooted in stupidity besides Fargo? Rating: 10 Grade: A+

    This is basically Coen brothers classic breakthrough film. And the story is superbly put together and crafted so well. To the point it makes it one of the top crime films that is a must watch. It's a serious crime story shown in a subtle and yet engaging manner, with slight awkward humor in it. But still stays consistent as a cold story about greed and the distances some people would go for their ambitions. Like the incompetence of the criminals and how it leads them from one mistake to another, one trouble to another. And innocent people gets involved one after another, because of dumb ideas. However, although this story takes place in a dry and boring snowy town. It's kinda amazing how the Coen brothers could pull off naive and dense characters that are actually still believable, while also entertaining to watch. And when it comes down to it, the mannerisms and the demeanor of the characters is what really drives this movie. And the Coen brothers just nails and makes these awkward characters to be intriguing, because of the random and yet believable decisions they make. This is one of those movies that could have fell flat, but thanks to Coen brothers trademark directions. Thus it's amusing and even intriguing at times, because of the random and yet witty and clever storytelling. Overall this is a film with a dry and boring setting, with awkward and yet dull characters that is really worth seeing. 8.6/10

    Marge Gunderson's pregnancy is seldom acknowledged in "Fargo," but a critical review almost has to mention it. It's a notable fact because, in moviedom, pregnancies are usually used symbolically or to raise the stakes. Audiences may react more strongly to things that happen to a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman, and screenwriters can generate quick, cheap pathos with a childbirth scene. But that's not what Joel and Ethan Coen do in "Fargo", and viewers may be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that the heroine is pregnant at all. It is only referenced lightly and in passing: a sight gag about how much buffet food she's eating, for example, or a tossed-off pretense for her to take a seat across from a potential suspect. The pregnancy doesn't limit her ability to do police work, and it doesn't mark her as undesirable to a man who wants to rekindle an old relationship. It may as well not be there, but it is there, and that makes it an interesting decision by the brothers Coen, who have too keen eyes for details to have done it absentmindedly. By rejecting the typical purposes of pregnancy in film, they show, perhaps, that it need have no special meaning; Marge is a cop investigating a triple homicide in a small Midwestern town, and that's all we really need to know. Whether she's pregnant or drinks coffee or eats eggs are just details.

    Evil as depicted in films such as "Fargo" and "Badlands" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In "Fargo" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over "a little bit of money" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are "doing pretty good" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying. This is a depiction of humankind at their worst and their best. It is a roller-coaster ride and possibly the best film ever made. And the score is just brilliant.

    OK. So this opens with a claim that it's based on a true story - supposedly actual events that occurred in Minnesota in 1987. But it turns out that the Coen brothers (directors Joel and Ethan) were lying. This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny. To be honest I'd have been upset with myself for being so amused by a movie that featured so much carnage if it actually had been true! The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) - the kidnapping having been planned by her husband Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry's in some sort of financial bind - although it's never really explained what the bind is. He needs money, and to get it he arranges for his wife's kidnapping so that his wealthy father-in- law will pay a ransom, which will then be split between the kidnappers and Jerry. Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic. This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota. Yaaaah. That was funny fer sher. Yaaaah. I forgive the Coen brothers. It's actually good that this wasn't really based on a true story. It makes the movie easier to laugh at. (7/10).

When the cinematography is matched with the near-perfect editing, masterful mise-en-scene results. The supporting characters in Fargo think they have the simple situations they create under control, but the only character who really has a clue is the protagonist (introduced in an unconventional manner), splendidly created by Frances McDormand. In every performance by an actor in film, though all creatively their own, traces from past films often inspire the actors to make certain choices. In the skin of Marge, McDormand doesn't rely on inspiration, she relies on her own creativity. Every character is appropriately acted and drawn out to their full potential, I'm satisfied with everyone's development. William H. Macy humanizes his questionable character with quality to note. I've seen Fargo a good number of times, I've always been aware that it's a great, original film, but I never lived it as I did this past viewing. What other film could you sit through a storyline rooted in stupidity besides Fargo? Rating: 10 Grade: A+

    This is basically Coen brothers classic breakthrough film. And the story is superbly put together and crafted so well. To the point it makes it one of the top crime films that is a must watch. It's a serious crime story shown in a subtle and yet engaging manner, with slight awkward humor in it. But still stays consistent as a cold story about greed and the distances some people would go for their ambitions. Like the incompetence of the criminals and how it leads them from one mistake to another, one trouble to another. And innocent people gets involved one after another, because of dumb ideas. However, although this story takes place in a dry and boring snowy town. It's kinda amazing how the Coen brothers could pull off naive and dense characters that are actually still believable, while also entertaining to watch. And when it comes down to it, the mannerisms and the demeanor of the characters is what really drives this movie. And the Coen brothers just nails and makes these awkward characters to be intriguing, because of the random and yet believable decisions they make. This is one of those movies that could have fell flat, but thanks to Coen brothers trademark directions. Thus it's amusing and even intriguing at times, because of the random and yet witty and clever storytelling. Overall this is a film with a dry and boring setting, with awkward and yet dull characters that is really worth seeing. 8.6/10

    Marge Gunderson's pregnancy is seldom acknowledged in "Fargo," but a critical review almost has to mention it. It's a notable fact because, in moviedom, pregnancies are usually used symbolically or to raise the stakes. Audiences may react more strongly to things that happen to a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman, and screenwriters can generate quick, cheap pathos with a childbirth scene. But that's not what Joel and Ethan Coen do in "Fargo", and viewers may be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that the heroine is pregnant at all. It is only referenced lightly and in passing: a sight gag about how much buffet food she's eating, for example, or a tossed-off pretense for her to take a seat across from a potential suspect. The pregnancy doesn't limit her ability to do police work, and it doesn't mark her as undesirable to a man who wants to rekindle an old relationship. It may as well not be there, but it is there, and that makes it an interesting decision by the brothers Coen, who have too keen eyes for details to have done it absentmindedly. By rejecting the typical purposes of pregnancy in film, they show, perhaps, that it need have no special meaning; Marge is a cop investigating a triple homicide in a small Midwestern town, and that's all we really need to know. Whether she's pregnant or drinks coffee or eats eggs are just details.

    Evil as depicted in films such as "Fargo" and "Badlands" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In "Fargo" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over "a little bit of money" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are "doing pretty good" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying. This is a depiction of humankind at their worst and their best. It is a roller-coaster ride and possibly the best film ever made. And the score is just brilliant.

    OK. So this opens with a claim that it's based on a true story - supposedly actual events that occurred in Minnesota in 1987. But it turns out that the Coen brothers (directors Joel and Ethan) were lying. This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny. To be honest I'd have been upset with myself for being so amused by a movie that featured so much carnage if it actually had been true! The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) - the kidnapping having been planned by her husband Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry's in some sort of financial bind - although it's never really explained what the bind is. He needs money, and to get it he arranges for his wife's kidnapping so that his wealthy father-in- law will pay a ransom, which will then be split between the kidnappers and Jerry. Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic. This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota. Yaaaah. That was funny fer sher. Yaaaah. I forgive the Coen brothers. It's actually good that this wasn't really based on a true story. It makes the movie easier to laugh at. (7/10).

    So Argo has no major stars and well known stars still the film shines and gave the actors some reputation in the film business and respect. And the most important job was for the director Joel Coen who had chosen great actors for their role was brilliant and mind-blowing like William H. Macy who played Jerry Lundegaard a car's salesman manager own by his father in law in Minnesota and wanted to start a new businese and has a lack amount of sums to start on a businese and planned to pay 40,000 and a car to Carl Snowalter played by Steve Buscemi and Gaear Grimsrud played by Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife and ask his father in law 1 million dollars. Steve Buscemi played a delightful and a strong role and it was his ever the best role in this film and the energy of his speech delivery was unbelievably done and had matched the character correctly and lastly for Peter Stormare's role was much mature and he really got so in to the role that it was like its his real life attitude and I was so great full to watch this film it's a mind-blowing crime classic that I ever watch.And if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it and It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness.

    This is probably one of the most bittersweet pictures I've seen. Bitter, because I always felt it's a rather bleak and disturbing affair, but rendered sweet thanks to the colorful group of characters and their amusing banter (which is nicely emphasized with all those accents they have there, don'tcha know?). Parts of this film are pretty amusing, but parts of it are pretty sad. The whole affair is a funny-but-sad case. This story is pieced together from a couple of real-life cases, but populated with fictional characters. It's a pretty simple set-up: a man arranges to have his own wife kidnapped, hoping to weasel money from her father in the form of a ransom. What should be a simple and painless situation becomes a total disaster, because nearly every character thinks they know what they're doing and they think they're so hot, but they're all really inept. A series of mishaps and bad decisions causes a cascade of murders and a rather tragic outcome. Well, heck, the final scene is one of the bloodiest and messed-up things conceivable. As crazy and funny as it is to see things deteriorate over stupid mistakes, it is a sobering reflection on crime, greed, and humanity overall. I think the cop sums it up well at the end, for after running through the situation, she asks, "and for what? For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Dontcha know that?" All that being said, I feel the story does take one too many random tangents. A lot of screen time is spent on the cop's personal life, which never really has much relevance to the case. I suppose it's perfect for showing a little more humanity on screen, and to contrast directly with the other guy's family. However, I do believe these extraneous scenes slow down the pacing a lot, and sidetracks from the main story. This film has good, straightforward photography and editing. Acting is effectively perfect from the whole cast, and the writing is good. This production uses very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Carter Burwell's music score is haunting, dramatic, and beautiful all at once. This film has garnered its share of acclaim for darn good reasons. I always believed it could be a tighter film, but it is still well worth seeing for its great cast, its distinctive dialogue (complete with accents), and its ability to instill feelings of amusement and sorrow. Recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    The Coen brothers really deliver this time with Fargo, a murder story with quirky overtones and a flawless script that really sells the character interaction in an otherworld reality of sorts. Don't write the acting off for no 'big names', the actors all play their roles to perfection and sell the script with their excellent delivery of at times almost comical lines that still fit in with the dark drama atmosphere which gives it an undeniable creep factor. Stripped down Fargo is still a crime drama but it is one done right. With stellar acting and a script to match it adds a quirky creep to the dark story. Everything fits together in a world unfamiliar yet normal in this homespun murder story.

    Fargo is a film a film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is about the a very simple crime going horribly wrong. The film opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, entering into an arrangement with Carl Showalter, played by Steve Buscemi, and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Peter Stormare. The arrangement is for Carl and Gaear to abduct Jerry's wife, Jean, and hold her for ransom. The deal is supposed to involve no violence, and they are told they will get $40,000 in addition to a brand new vehicle. This should be a fairly simple plan, as Jean's father clearly has the means to pay the ransom, but this simple plan goes horribly wrong. This movie, as almost all, has multiple themes. Jerry's problems all develop due to his spinelessness, ineffectiveness, and general inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions. One of the themes of the film is that there are consequences of hiding sin. Jerry has a serious embezzling problem, and frankly it is never explained where he is spending this enormous sum of money. The movie elaborate that he is in immediate need of at least $320,000 due to GMAC discovering money he stole. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he constructs this insane plan to have Carl and Gaear kidnap his wife and hold her hostage to get his father-in-law's money. Jerry is so ineffective that he doesn't even show up on-time for his meeting with Carl and Gaear. Instead of admitting to his father-in-law that he stole $320,000, he tries to arrange a real-estate deal with him. Instead of planning through this business deal properly, his father-in-law assumes Jerry just wants a finder's fee for bringing the deal to him. This is further proof of Jerry's extreme spinelessness and ineptness Jerry is so incompetent that he fails to talk his father out of dropping off the money to the kidnappers. This is a disastrous consequence that results from the fact that he is concealing the theft of the money and his plan to cover up the theft. Jerry's entire plan for the crime was to take $1 million from his father-in-law, and give the kidnappers he hired $80,000. This idea is completely ruined when his father-in-law takes the money to the kidnappers instead of Jerry. Jerry further causes pain by ineptly allowing Wade to go through with this. The consequence of this is that Wade is killed by Carl, and an innocent parking lot attendant. These are direct consequences of Jerry being a bungling fool. The further theme of the film is that sin quickly escalates into greater sin. Carl and Gaear are engaged in the crime of kidnapping Jerry's wife, and they quickly escalate this. The initial choice to take part in this evil activity causes a state trooper to stop them. Gaear then kills the state trooper, but there are witnesses to this that unluckily decided to drive by at the wrong time. Gaear then kills those witnesses. Thus, what starts as a simple non-violent abduction turns into a triple homicide. This is just the beginning of the cycle. The triple homicide creates further despair when Carl kills Wade and the parking lot attendant. This shows the continuing cycle of crime creating more crime. The cycle continues when Gaear kills Jerry's wife and Carl. This cycle of crime creating more crime doesn't stop until Marge, a police officer, confronts Gaear as he is stuffing Carl into a wood chipper. Overall, this film is quite strong. It shows a superior effort went into the film. It is very effective at conveying its message. It is well directed, well edited, and highly effective. On the negative side, I question the point of hiding Jerry's motive for stealing all of this money. Explaining his scheme to steal money from GMAC would also be appreciated. This film is only 98 minutes long, and thus, has more than sufficient time to explain Jerry's motive for stealing this money. I do not see how this helps accomplish the film's ultimate intent. Other than that, I would say it is a very strong film. Overall, I would rate it a 9 out of 10.

    No matter where you start to explain Fargo, it's hard to begin anywhere without "original" being present in the definition. The Coen Brothers constructed interesting films before Fargo, but this is what really pushed them to the top of the movie world "food chain" per se and established them as landmark filmmakers. The editing, directing, and writing is molded with a specific vision that is fulfilled on screen. The funny one-liners, repetition amongst characters, and the squeaking accents do draw laughs, but they hardly do justice for the film's originality and brilliance. It's a relatively ordinary setting and characters that are stretched out into a plot that would goes under the microscope and explored in the story in more detail than most films would for this simple set up. Then, once the Coens supply a huge shell to fill with a story, they form a bizarre, satisfying storyline that grows its own mind after taking off in Act 1. A misconception that viewers have about the cinematography of movies is the mise-en-scene has to be visually beautiful, assumed to be found in fantasy films and period pieces. Fargo covers territory of regular landscapes and they are beautiful in themselves, but each shot is thought up and executed to carefully capture something specific. When the cinematography is matched with the near-perfect editing, masterful mise-en-scene results.

I always believed it could be a tighter film, but it is still well worth seeing for its great cast, its distinctive dialogue (complete with accents), and its ability to instill feelings of amusement and sorrow. Recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    The Coen brothers really deliver this time with Fargo, a murder story with quirky overtones and a flawless script that really sells the character interaction in an otherworld reality of sorts. Don't write the acting off for no 'big names', the actors all play their roles to perfection and sell the script with their excellent delivery of at times almost comical lines that still fit in with the dark drama atmosphere which gives it an undeniable creep factor. Stripped down Fargo is still a crime drama but it is one done right. With stellar acting and a script to match it adds a quirky creep to the dark story. Everything fits together in a world unfamiliar yet normal in this homespun murder story.

    Fargo is a film a film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is about the a very simple crime going horribly wrong. The film opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, entering into an arrangement with Carl Showalter, played by Steve Buscemi, and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Peter Stormare. The arrangement is for Carl and Gaear to abduct Jerry's wife, Jean, and hold her for ransom. The deal is supposed to involve no violence, and they are told they will get $40,000 in addition to a brand new vehicle. This should be a fairly simple plan, as Jean's father clearly has the means to pay the ransom, but this simple plan goes horribly wrong. This movie, as almost all, has multiple themes. Jerry's problems all develop due to his spinelessness, ineffectiveness, and general inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions. One of the themes of the film is that there are consequences of hiding sin. Jerry has a serious embezzling problem, and frankly it is never explained where he is spending this enormous sum of money. The movie elaborate that he is in immediate need of at least $320,000 due to GMAC discovering money he stole. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he constructs this insane plan to have Carl and Gaear kidnap his wife and hold her hostage to get his father-in-law's money. Jerry is so ineffective that he doesn't even show up on-time for his meeting with Carl and Gaear. Instead of admitting to his father-in-law that he stole $320,000, he tries to arrange a real-estate deal with him. Instead of planning through this business deal properly, his father-in-law assumes Jerry just wants a finder's fee for bringing the deal to him. This is further proof of Jerry's extreme spinelessness and ineptness Jerry is so incompetent that he fails to talk his father out of dropping off the money to the kidnappers. This is a disastrous consequence that results from the fact that he is concealing the theft of the money and his plan to cover up the theft. Jerry's entire plan for the crime was to take $1 million from his father-in-law, and give the kidnappers he hired $80,000. This idea is completely ruined when his father-in-law takes the money to the kidnappers instead of Jerry. Jerry further causes pain by ineptly allowing Wade to go through with this. The consequence of this is that Wade is killed by Carl, and an innocent parking lot attendant. These are direct consequences of Jerry being a bungling fool. The further theme of the film is that sin quickly escalates into greater sin. Carl and Gaear are engaged in the crime of kidnapping Jerry's wife, and they quickly escalate this. The initial choice to take part in this evil activity causes a state trooper to stop them. Gaear then kills the state trooper, but there are witnesses to this that unluckily decided to drive by at the wrong time. Gaear then kills those witnesses. Thus, what starts as a simple non-violent abduction turns into a triple homicide. This is just the beginning of the cycle. The triple homicide creates further despair when Carl kills Wade and the parking lot attendant. This shows the continuing cycle of crime creating more crime. The cycle continues when Gaear kills Jerry's wife and Carl. This cycle of crime creating more crime doesn't stop until Marge, a police officer, confronts Gaear as he is stuffing Carl into a wood chipper. Overall, this film is quite strong. It shows a superior effort went into the film. It is very effective at conveying its message. It is well directed, well edited, and highly effective. On the negative side, I question the point of hiding Jerry's motive for stealing all of this money. Explaining his scheme to steal money from GMAC would also be appreciated. This film is only 98 minutes long, and thus, has more than sufficient time to explain Jerry's motive for stealing this money. I do not see how this helps accomplish the film's ultimate intent. Other than that, I would say it is a very strong film. Overall, I would rate it a 9 out of 10.

    No matter where you start to explain Fargo, it's hard to begin anywhere without "original" being present in the definition. The Coen Brothers constructed interesting films before Fargo, but this is what really pushed them to the top of the movie world "food chain" per se and established them as landmark filmmakers. The editing, directing, and writing is molded with a specific vision that is fulfilled on screen. The funny one-liners, repetition amongst characters, and the squeaking accents do draw laughs, but they hardly do justice for the film's originality and brilliance. It's a relatively ordinary setting and characters that are stretched out into a plot that would goes under the microscope and explored in the story in more detail than most films would for this simple set up. Then, once the Coens supply a huge shell to fill with a story, they form a bizarre, satisfying storyline that grows its own mind after taking off in Act 1. A misconception that viewers have about the cinematography of movies is the mise-en-scene has to be visually beautiful, assumed to be found in fantasy films and period pieces. Fargo covers territory of regular landscapes and they are beautiful in themselves, but each shot is thought up and executed to carefully capture something specific. When the cinematography is matched with the near-perfect editing, masterful mise-en-scene results. The supporting characters in Fargo think they have the simple situations they create under control, but the only character who really has a clue is the protagonist (introduced in an unconventional manner), splendidly created by Frances McDormand. In every performance by an actor in film, though all creatively their own, traces from past films often inspire the actors to make certain choices. In the skin of Marge, McDormand doesn't rely on inspiration, she relies on her own creativity. Every character is appropriately acted and drawn out to their full potential, I'm satisfied with everyone's development. William H. Macy humanizes his questionable character with quality to note. I've seen Fargo a good number of times, I've always been aware that it's a great, original film, but I never lived it as I did this past viewing. What other film could you sit through a storyline rooted in stupidity besides Fargo? Rating: 10 Grade: A+

    This is basically Coen brothers classic breakthrough film. And the story is superbly put together and crafted so well. To the point it makes it one of the top crime films that is a must watch. It's a serious crime story shown in a subtle and yet engaging manner, with slight awkward humor in it. But still stays consistent as a cold story about greed and the distances some people would go for their ambitions. Like the incompetence of the criminals and how it leads them from one mistake to another, one trouble to another. And innocent people gets involved one after another, because of dumb ideas. However, although this story takes place in a dry and boring snowy town. It's kinda amazing how the Coen brothers could pull off naive and dense characters that are actually still believable, while also entertaining to watch. And when it comes down to it, the mannerisms and the demeanor of the characters is what really drives this movie. And the Coen brothers just nails and makes these awkward characters to be intriguing, because of the random and yet believable decisions they make. This is one of those movies that could have fell flat, but thanks to Coen brothers trademark directions. Thus it's amusing and even intriguing at times, because of the random and yet witty and clever storytelling. Overall this is a film with a dry and boring setting, with awkward and yet dull characters that is really worth seeing. 8.6/10

    Marge Gunderson's pregnancy is seldom acknowledged in "Fargo," but a critical review almost has to mention it. It's a notable fact because, in moviedom, pregnancies are usually used symbolically or to raise the stakes. Audiences may react more strongly to things that happen to a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman, and screenwriters can generate quick, cheap pathos with a childbirth scene. But that's not what Joel and Ethan Coen do in "Fargo", and viewers may be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that the heroine is pregnant at all. It is only referenced lightly and in passing: a sight gag about how much buffet food she's eating, for example, or a tossed-off pretense for her to take a seat across from a potential suspect. The pregnancy doesn't limit her ability to do police work, and it doesn't mark her as undesirable to a man who wants to rekindle an old relationship. It may as well not be there, but it is there, and that makes it an interesting decision by the brothers Coen, who have too keen eyes for details to have done it absentmindedly. By rejecting the typical purposes of pregnancy in film, they show, perhaps, that it need have no special meaning; Marge is a cop investigating a triple homicide in a small Midwestern town, and that's all we really need to know. Whether she's pregnant or drinks coffee or eats eggs are just details.

    Evil as depicted in films such as "Fargo" and "Badlands" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In "Fargo" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over "a little bit of money" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are "doing pretty good" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying. This is a depiction of humankind at their worst and their best. It is a roller-coaster ride and possibly the best film ever made. And the score is just brilliant.

    OK. So this opens with a claim that it's based on a true story - supposedly actual events that occurred in Minnesota in 1987. But it turns out that the Coen brothers (directors Joel and Ethan) were lying. This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny. To be honest I'd have been upset with myself for being so amused by a movie that featured so much carnage if it actually had been true! The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) - the kidnapping having been planned by her husband Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry's in some sort of financial bind - although it's never really explained what the bind is. He needs money, and to get it he arranges for his wife's kidnapping so that his wealthy father-in- law will pay a ransom, which will then be split between the kidnappers and Jerry. Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic. This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota. Yaaaah. That was funny fer sher. Yaaaah. I forgive the Coen brothers. It's actually good that this wasn't really based on a true story. It makes the movie easier to laugh at. (7/10).

    So Argo has no major stars and well known stars still the film shines and gave the actors some reputation in the film business and respect. And the most important job was for the director Joel Coen who had chosen great actors for their role was brilliant and mind-blowing like William H. Macy who played Jerry Lundegaard a car's salesman manager own by his father in law in Minnesota and wanted to start a new businese and has a lack amount of sums to start on a businese and planned to pay 40,000 and a car to Carl Snowalter played by Steve Buscemi and Gaear Grimsrud played by Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife and ask his father in law 1 million dollars. Steve Buscemi played a delightful and a strong role and it was his ever the best role in this film and the energy of his speech delivery was unbelievably done and had matched the character correctly and lastly for Peter Stormare's role was much mature and he really got so in to the role that it was like its his real life attitude and I was so great full to watch this film it's a mind-blowing crime classic that I ever watch.And if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it and It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness.

    This is probably one of the most bittersweet pictures I've seen. Bitter, because I always felt it's a rather bleak and disturbing affair, but rendered sweet thanks to the colorful group of characters and their amusing banter (which is nicely emphasized with all those accents they have there, don'tcha know?). Parts of this film are pretty amusing, but parts of it are pretty sad. The whole affair is a funny-but-sad case. This story is pieced together from a couple of real-life cases, but populated with fictional characters. It's a pretty simple set-up: a man arranges to have his own wife kidnapped, hoping to weasel money from her father in the form of a ransom. What should be a simple and painless situation becomes a total disaster, because nearly every character thinks they know what they're doing and they think they're so hot, but they're all really inept. A series of mishaps and bad decisions causes a cascade of murders and a rather tragic outcome. Well, heck, the final scene is one of the bloodiest and messed-up things conceivable. As crazy and funny as it is to see things deteriorate over stupid mistakes, it is a sobering reflection on crime, greed, and humanity overall. I think the cop sums it up well at the end, for after running through the situation, she asks, "and for what? For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Dontcha know that?" All that being said, I feel the story does take one too many random tangents. A lot of screen time is spent on the cop's personal life, which never really has much relevance to the case. I suppose it's perfect for showing a little more humanity on screen, and to contrast directly with the other guy's family. However, I do believe these extraneous scenes slow down the pacing a lot, and sidetracks from the main story. This film has good, straightforward photography and editing. Acting is effectively perfect from the whole cast, and the writing is good. This production uses very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Carter Burwell's music score is haunting, dramatic, and beautiful all at once. This film has garnered its share of acclaim for darn good reasons. I always believed it could be a tighter film, but it is still well worth seeing for its great cast, its distinctive dialogue (complete with accents), and its ability to instill feelings of amusement and sorrow. Recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

The pregnancy doesn't limit her ability to do police work, and it doesn't mark her as undesirable to a man who wants to rekindle an old relationship. It may as well not be there, but it is there, and that makes it an interesting decision by the brothers Coen, who have too keen eyes for details to have done it absentmindedly. By rejecting the typical purposes of pregnancy in film, they show, perhaps, that it need have no special meaning; Marge is a cop investigating a triple homicide in a small Midwestern town, and that's all we really need to know. Whether she's pregnant or drinks coffee or eats eggs are just details.

    Evil as depicted in films such as "Fargo" and "Badlands" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In "Fargo" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over "a little bit of money" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are "doing pretty good" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying. This is a depiction of humankind at their worst and their best. It is a roller-coaster ride and possibly the best film ever made. And the score is just brilliant.

    OK. So this opens with a claim that it's based on a true story - supposedly actual events that occurred in Minnesota in 1987. But it turns out that the Coen brothers (directors Joel and Ethan) were lying. This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny. To be honest I'd have been upset with myself for being so amused by a movie that featured so much carnage if it actually had been true! The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) - the kidnapping having been planned by her husband Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry's in some sort of financial bind - although it's never really explained what the bind is. He needs money, and to get it he arranges for his wife's kidnapping so that his wealthy father-in- law will pay a ransom, which will then be split between the kidnappers and Jerry. Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic. This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota. Yaaaah. That was funny fer sher. Yaaaah. I forgive the Coen brothers. It's actually good that this wasn't really based on a true story. It makes the movie easier to laugh at. (7/10).

    So Argo has no major stars and well known stars still the film shines and gave the actors some reputation in the film business and respect. And the most important job was for the director Joel Coen who had chosen great actors for their role was brilliant and mind-blowing like William H. Macy who played Jerry Lundegaard a car's salesman manager own by his father in law in Minnesota and wanted to start a new businese and has a lack amount of sums to start on a businese and planned to pay 40,000 and a car to Carl Snowalter played by Steve Buscemi and Gaear Grimsrud played by Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife and ask his father in law 1 million dollars. Steve Buscemi played a delightful and a strong role and it was his ever the best role in this film and the energy of his speech delivery was unbelievably done and had matched the character correctly and lastly for Peter Stormare's role was much mature and he really got so in to the role that it was like its his real life attitude and I was so great full to watch this film it's a mind-blowing crime classic that I ever watch.And if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it and It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness.

    This is probably one of the most bittersweet pictures I've seen. Bitter, because I always felt it's a rather bleak and disturbing affair, but rendered sweet thanks to the colorful group of characters and their amusing banter (which is nicely emphasized with all those accents they have there, don'tcha know?). Parts of this film are pretty amusing, but parts of it are pretty sad. The whole affair is a funny-but-sad case. This story is pieced together from a couple of real-life cases, but populated with fictional characters. It's a pretty simple set-up: a man arranges to have his own wife kidnapped, hoping to weasel money from her father in the form of a ransom. What should be a simple and painless situation becomes a total disaster, because nearly every character thinks they know what they're doing and they think they're so hot, but they're all really inept. A series of mishaps and bad decisions causes a cascade of murders and a rather tragic outcome. Well, heck, the final scene is one of the bloodiest and messed-up things conceivable. As crazy and funny as it is to see things deteriorate over stupid mistakes, it is a sobering reflection on crime, greed, and humanity overall. I think the cop sums it up well at the end, for after running through the situation, she asks, "and for what? For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Dontcha know that?" All that being said, I feel the story does take one too many random tangents. A lot of screen time is spent on the cop's personal life, which never really has much relevance to the case. I suppose it's perfect for showing a little more humanity on screen, and to contrast directly with the other guy's family. However, I do believe these extraneous scenes slow down the pacing a lot, and sidetracks from the main story. This film has good, straightforward photography and editing. Acting is effectively perfect from the whole cast, and the writing is good. This production uses very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Carter Burwell's music score is haunting, dramatic, and beautiful all at once. This film has garnered its share of acclaim for darn good reasons. I always believed it could be a tighter film, but it is still well worth seeing for its great cast, its distinctive dialogue (complete with accents), and its ability to instill feelings of amusement and sorrow. Recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    The Coen brothers really deliver this time with Fargo, a murder story with quirky overtones and a flawless script that really sells the character interaction in an otherworld reality of sorts. Don't write the acting off for no 'big names', the actors all play their roles to perfection and sell the script with their excellent delivery of at times almost comical lines that still fit in with the dark drama atmosphere which gives it an undeniable creep factor. Stripped down Fargo is still a crime drama but it is one done right. With stellar acting and a script to match it adds a quirky creep to the dark story. Everything fits together in a world unfamiliar yet normal in this homespun murder story.

    Fargo is a film a film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is about the a very simple crime going horribly wrong. The film opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, entering into an arrangement with Carl Showalter, played by Steve Buscemi, and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Peter Stormare. The arrangement is for Carl and Gaear to abduct Jerry's wife, Jean, and hold her for ransom. The deal is supposed to involve no violence, and they are told they will get $40,000 in addition to a brand new vehicle. This should be a fairly simple plan, as Jean's father clearly has the means to pay the ransom, but this simple plan goes horribly wrong. This movie, as almost all, has multiple themes. Jerry's problems all develop due to his spinelessness, ineffectiveness, and general inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions. One of the themes of the film is that there are consequences of hiding sin. Jerry has a serious embezzling problem, and frankly it is never explained where he is spending this enormous sum of money. The movie elaborate that he is in immediate need of at least $320,000 due to GMAC discovering money he stole. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he constructs this insane plan to have Carl and Gaear kidnap his wife and hold her hostage to get his father-in-law's money. Jerry is so ineffective that he doesn't even show up on-time for his meeting with Carl and Gaear. Instead of admitting to his father-in-law that he stole $320,000, he tries to arrange a real-estate deal with him. Instead of planning through this business deal properly, his father-in-law assumes Jerry just wants a finder's fee for bringing the deal to him. This is further proof of Jerry's extreme spinelessness and ineptness Jerry is so incompetent that he fails to talk his father out of dropping off the money to the kidnappers. This is a disastrous consequence that results from the fact that he is concealing the theft of the money and his plan to cover up the theft. Jerry's entire plan for the crime was to take $1 million from his father-in-law, and give the kidnappers he hired $80,000. This idea is completely ruined when his father-in-law takes the money to the kidnappers instead of Jerry. Jerry further causes pain by ineptly allowing Wade to go through with this. The consequence of this is that Wade is killed by Carl, and an innocent parking lot attendant. These are direct consequences of Jerry being a bungling fool. The further theme of the film is that sin quickly escalates into greater sin. Carl and Gaear are engaged in the crime of kidnapping Jerry's wife, and they quickly escalate this. The initial choice to take part in this evil activity causes a state trooper to stop them. Gaear then kills the state trooper, but there are witnesses to this that unluckily decided to drive by at the wrong time. Gaear then kills those witnesses. Thus, what starts as a simple non-violent abduction turns into a triple homicide. This is just the beginning of the cycle. The triple homicide creates further despair when Carl kills Wade and the parking lot attendant. This shows the continuing cycle of crime creating more crime. The cycle continues when Gaear kills Jerry's wife and Carl. This cycle of crime creating more crime doesn't stop until Marge, a police officer, confronts Gaear as he is stuffing Carl into a wood chipper. Overall, this film is quite strong. It shows a superior effort went into the film. It is very effective at conveying its message. It is well directed, well edited, and highly effective. On the negative side, I question the point of hiding Jerry's motive for stealing all of this money. Explaining his scheme to steal money from GMAC would also be appreciated. This film is only 98 minutes long, and thus, has more than sufficient time to explain Jerry's motive for stealing this money. I do not see how this helps accomplish the film's ultimate intent. Other than that, I would say it is a very strong film. Overall, I would rate it a 9 out of 10.

    No matter where you start to explain Fargo, it's hard to begin anywhere without "original" being present in the definition. The Coen Brothers constructed interesting films before Fargo, but this is what really pushed them to the top of the movie world "food chain" per se and established them as landmark filmmakers. The editing, directing, and writing is molded with a specific vision that is fulfilled on screen. The funny one-liners, repetition amongst characters, and the squeaking accents do draw laughs, but they hardly do justice for the film's originality and brilliance. It's a relatively ordinary setting and characters that are stretched out into a plot that would goes under the microscope and explored in the story in more detail than most films would for this simple set up. Then, once the Coens supply a huge shell to fill with a story, they form a bizarre, satisfying storyline that grows its own mind after taking off in Act 1. A misconception that viewers have about the cinematography of movies is the mise-en-scene has to be visually beautiful, assumed to be found in fantasy films and period pieces. Fargo covers territory of regular landscapes and they are beautiful in themselves, but each shot is thought up and executed to carefully capture something specific. When the cinematography is matched with the near-perfect editing, masterful mise-en-scene results. The supporting characters in Fargo think they have the simple situations they create under control, but the only character who really has a clue is the protagonist (introduced in an unconventional manner), splendidly created by Frances McDormand. In every performance by an actor in film, though all creatively their own, traces from past films often inspire the actors to make certain choices. In the skin of Marge, McDormand doesn't rely on inspiration, she relies on her own creativity. Every character is appropriately acted and drawn out to their full potential, I'm satisfied with everyone's development. William H. Macy humanizes his questionable character with quality to note. I've seen Fargo a good number of times, I've always been aware that it's a great, original film, but I never lived it as I did this past viewing. What other film could you sit through a storyline rooted in stupidity besides Fargo? Rating: 10 Grade: A+

    This is basically Coen brothers classic breakthrough film. And the story is superbly put together and crafted so well. To the point it makes it one of the top crime films that is a must watch. It's a serious crime story shown in a subtle and yet engaging manner, with slight awkward humor in it. But still stays consistent as a cold story about greed and the distances some people would go for their ambitions. Like the incompetence of the criminals and how it leads them from one mistake to another, one trouble to another. And innocent people gets involved one after another, because of dumb ideas. However, although this story takes place in a dry and boring snowy town. It's kinda amazing how the Coen brothers could pull off naive and dense characters that are actually still believable, while also entertaining to watch. And when it comes down to it, the mannerisms and the demeanor of the characters is what really drives this movie. And the Coen brothers just nails and makes these awkward characters to be intriguing, because of the random and yet believable decisions they make. This is one of those movies that could have fell flat, but thanks to Coen brothers trademark directions. Thus it's amusing and even intriguing at times, because of the random and yet witty and clever storytelling. Overall this is a film with a dry and boring setting, with awkward and yet dull characters that is really worth seeing. 8.6/10

    Marge Gunderson's pregnancy is seldom acknowledged in "Fargo," but a critical review almost has to mention it. It's a notable fact because, in moviedom, pregnancies are usually used symbolically or to raise the stakes. Audiences may react more strongly to things that happen to a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman, and screenwriters can generate quick, cheap pathos with a childbirth scene. But that's not what Joel and Ethan Coen do in "Fargo", and viewers may be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that the heroine is pregnant at all. It is only referenced lightly and in passing: a sight gag about how much buffet food she's eating, for example, or a tossed-off pretense for her to take a seat across from a potential suspect. The pregnancy doesn't limit her ability to do police work, and it doesn't mark her as undesirable to a man who wants to rekindle an old relationship. It may as well not be there, but it is there, and that makes it an interesting decision by the brothers Coen, who have too keen eyes for details to have done it absentmindedly. By rejecting the typical purposes of pregnancy in film, they show, perhaps, that it need have no special meaning; Marge is a cop investigating a triple homicide in a small Midwestern town, and that's all we really need to know. Whether she's pregnant or drinks coffee or eats eggs are just details.

    Fargo is a film a film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is about the a very simple crime going horribly wrong. The film opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, entering into an arrangement with Carl Showalter, played by Steve Buscemi, and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Peter Stormare. The arrangement is for Carl and Gaear to abduct Jerry's wife, Jean, and hold her for ransom. The deal is supposed to involve no violence, and they are told they will get $40,000 in addition to a brand new vehicle. This should be a fairly simple plan, as Jean's father clearly has the means to pay the ransom, but this simple plan goes horribly wrong. This movie, as almost all, has multiple themes. Jerry's problems all develop due to his spinelessness, ineffectiveness, and general inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions. One of the themes of the film is that there are consequences of hiding sin. Jerry has a serious embezzling problem, and frankly it is never explained where he is spending this enormous sum of money. The movie elaborate that he is in immediate need of at least $320,000 due to GMAC discovering money he stole. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he constructs this insane plan to have Carl and Gaear kidnap his wife and hold her hostage to get his father-in-law's money. Jerry is so ineffective that he doesn't even show up on-time for his meeting with Carl and Gaear. Instead of admitting to his father-in-law that he stole $320,000, he tries to arrange a real-estate deal with him. Instead of planning through this business deal properly, his father-in-law assumes Jerry just wants a finder's fee for bringing the deal to him. This is further proof of Jerry's extreme spinelessness and ineptness Jerry is so incompetent that he fails to talk his father out of dropping off the money to the kidnappers. This is a disastrous consequence that results from the fact that he is concealing the theft of the money and his plan to cover up the theft. Jerry's entire plan for the crime was to take $1 million from his father-in-law, and give the kidnappers he hired $80,000. This idea is completely ruined when his father-in-law takes the money to the kidnappers instead of Jerry. Jerry further causes pain by ineptly allowing Wade to go through with this. The consequence of this is that Wade is killed by Carl, and an innocent parking lot attendant. These are direct consequences of Jerry being a bungling fool. The further theme of the film is that sin quickly escalates into greater sin. Carl and Gaear are engaged in the crime of kidnapping Jerry's wife, and they quickly escalate this. The initial choice to take part in this evil activity causes a state trooper to stop them. Gaear then kills the state trooper, but there are witnesses to this that unluckily decided to drive by at the wrong time. Gaear then kills those witnesses. Thus, what starts as a simple non-violent abduction turns into a triple homicide. This is just the beginning of the cycle. The triple homicide creates further despair when Carl kills Wade and the parking lot attendant. This shows the continuing cycle of crime creating more crime. The cycle continues when Gaear kills Jerry's wife and Carl. This cycle of crime creating more crime doesn't stop until Marge, a police officer, confronts Gaear as he is stuffing Carl into a wood chipper. Overall, this film is quite strong. It shows a superior effort went into the film. It is very effective at conveying its message. It is well directed, well edited, and highly effective. On the negative side, I question the point of hiding Jerry's motive for stealing all of this money. Explaining his scheme to steal money from GMAC would also be appreciated. This film is only 98 minutes long, and thus, has more than sufficient time to explain Jerry's motive for stealing this money. I do not see how this helps accomplish the film's ultimate intent. Other than that, I would say it is a very strong film. Overall, I would rate it a 9 out of 10.

    No matter where you start to explain Fargo, it's hard to begin anywhere without "original" being present in the definition. The Coen Brothers constructed interesting films before Fargo, but this is what really pushed them to the top of the movie world "food chain" per se and established them as landmark filmmakers. The editing, directing, and writing is molded with a specific vision that is fulfilled on screen. The funny one-liners, repetition amongst characters, and the squeaking accents do draw laughs, but they hardly do justice for the film's originality and brilliance. It's a relatively ordinary setting and characters that are stretched out into a plot that would goes under the microscope and explored in the story in more detail than most films would for this simple set up. Then, once the Coens supply a huge shell to fill with a story, they form a bizarre, satisfying storyline that grows its own mind after taking off in Act 1. A misconception that viewers have about the cinematography of movies is the mise-en-scene has to be visually beautiful, assumed to be found in fantasy films and period pieces. Fargo covers territory of regular landscapes and they are beautiful in themselves, but each shot is thought up and executed to carefully capture something specific. When the cinematography is matched with the near-perfect editing, masterful mise-en-scene results. The supporting characters in Fargo think they have the simple situations they create under control, but the only character who really has a clue is the protagonist (introduced in an unconventional manner), splendidly created by Frances McDormand. In every performance by an actor in film, though all creatively their own, traces from past films often inspire the actors to make certain choices. In the skin of Marge, McDormand doesn't rely on inspiration, she relies on her own creativity. Every character is appropriately acted and drawn out to their full potential, I'm satisfied with everyone's development. William H. Macy humanizes his questionable character with quality to note. I've seen Fargo a good number of times, I've always been aware that it's a great, original film, but I never lived it as I did this past viewing. What other film could you sit through a storyline rooted in stupidity besides Fargo? Rating: 10 Grade: A+

    This is basically Coen brothers classic breakthrough film. And the story is superbly put together and crafted so well. To the point it makes it one of the top crime films that is a must watch. It's a serious crime story shown in a subtle and yet engaging manner, with slight awkward humor in it. But still stays consistent as a cold story about greed and the distances some people would go for their ambitions. Like the incompetence of the criminals and how it leads them from one mistake to another, one trouble to another. And innocent people gets involved one after another, because of dumb ideas. However, although this story takes place in a dry and boring snowy town. It's kinda amazing how the Coen brothers could pull off naive and dense characters that are actually still believable, while also entertaining to watch. And when it comes down to it, the mannerisms and the demeanor of the characters is what really drives this movie. And the Coen brothers just nails and makes these awkward characters to be intriguing, because of the random and yet believable decisions they make. This is one of those movies that could have fell flat, but thanks to Coen brothers trademark directions. Thus it's amusing and even intriguing at times, because of the random and yet witty and clever storytelling. Overall this is a film with a dry and boring setting, with awkward and yet dull characters that is really worth seeing. 8.6/10

    Marge Gunderson's pregnancy is seldom acknowledged in "Fargo," but a critical review almost has to mention it. It's a notable fact because, in moviedom, pregnancies are usually used symbolically or to raise the stakes. Audiences may react more strongly to things that happen to a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman, and screenwriters can generate quick, cheap pathos with a childbirth scene. But that's not what Joel and Ethan Coen do in "Fargo", and viewers may be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that the heroine is pregnant at all. It is only referenced lightly and in passing: a sight gag about how much buffet food she's eating, for example, or a tossed-off pretense for her to take a seat across from a potential suspect. The pregnancy doesn't limit her ability to do police work, and it doesn't mark her as undesirable to a man who wants to rekindle an old relationship. It may as well not be there, but it is there, and that makes it an interesting decision by the brothers Coen, who have too keen eyes for details to have done it absentmindedly. By rejecting the typical purposes of pregnancy in film, they show, perhaps, that it need have no special meaning; Marge is a cop investigating a triple homicide in a small Midwestern town, and that's all we really need to know. Whether she's pregnant or drinks coffee or eats eggs are just details.

    Evil as depicted in films such as "Fargo" and "Badlands" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In "Fargo" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over "a little bit of money" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are "doing pretty good" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying. This is a depiction of humankind at their worst and their best. It is a roller-coaster ride and possibly the best film ever made. And the score is just brilliant.

    OK. So this opens with a claim that it's based on a true story - supposedly actual events that occurred in Minnesota in 1987. But it turns out that the Coen brothers (directors Joel and Ethan) were lying. This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny. To be honest I'd have been upset with myself for being so amused by a movie that featured so much carnage if it actually had been true! The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) - the kidnapping having been planned by her husband Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry's in some sort of financial bind - although it's never really explained what the bind is. He needs money, and to get it he arranges for his wife's kidnapping so that his wealthy father-in- law will pay a ransom, which will then be split between the kidnappers and Jerry. Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic. This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota. Yaaaah. That was funny fer sher. Yaaaah. I forgive the Coen brothers. It's actually good that this wasn't really based on a true story. It makes the movie easier to laugh at. (7/10).

    So Argo has no major stars and well known stars still the film shines and gave the actors some reputation in the film business and respect. And the most important job was for the director Joel Coen who had chosen great actors for their role was brilliant and mind-blowing like William H. Macy who played Jerry Lundegaard a car's salesman manager own by his father in law in Minnesota and wanted to start a new businese and has a lack amount of sums to start on a businese and planned to pay 40,000 and a car to Carl Snowalter played by Steve Buscemi and Gaear Grimsrud played by Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife and ask his father in law 1 million dollars. Steve Buscemi played a delightful and a strong role and it was his ever the best role in this film and the energy of his speech delivery was unbelievably done and had matched the character correctly and lastly for Peter Stormare's role was much mature and he really got so in to the role that it was like its his real life attitude and I was so great full to watch this film it's a mind-blowing crime classic that I ever watch.And if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it and It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness.

    This is probably one of the most bittersweet pictures I've seen. Bitter, because I always felt it's a rather bleak and disturbing affair, but rendered sweet thanks to the colorful group of characters and their amusing banter (which is nicely emphasized with all those accents they have there, don'tcha know?). Parts of this film are pretty amusing, but parts of it are pretty sad. The whole affair is a funny-but-sad case. This story is pieced together from a couple of real-life cases, but populated with fictional characters. It's a pretty simple set-up: a man arranges to have his own wife kidnapped, hoping to weasel money from her father in the form of a ransom. What should be a simple and painless situation becomes a total disaster, because nearly every character thinks they know what they're doing and they think they're so hot, but they're all really inept. A series of mishaps and bad decisions causes a cascade of murders and a rather tragic outcome. Well, heck, the final scene is one of the bloodiest and messed-up things conceivable. As crazy and funny as it is to see things deteriorate over stupid mistakes, it is a sobering reflection on crime, greed, and humanity overall. I think the cop sums it up well at the end, for after running through the situation, she asks, "and for what? For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Dontcha know that?" All that being said, I feel the story does take one too many random tangents. A lot of screen time is spent on the cop's personal life, which never really has much relevance to the case. I suppose it's perfect for showing a little more humanity on screen, and to contrast directly with the other guy's family. However, I do believe these extraneous scenes slow down the pacing a lot, and sidetracks from the main story. This film has good, straightforward photography and editing. Acting is effectively perfect from the whole cast, and the writing is good. This production uses very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Carter Burwell's music score is haunting, dramatic, and beautiful all at once. This film has garnered its share of acclaim for darn good reasons. I always believed it could be a tighter film, but it is still well worth seeing for its great cast, its distinctive dialogue (complete with accents), and its ability to instill feelings of amusement and sorrow. Recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    The Coen brothers really deliver this time with Fargo, a murder story with quirky overtones and a flawless script that really sells the character interaction in an otherworld reality of sorts. Don't write the acting off for no 'big names', the actors all play their roles to perfection and sell the script with their excellent delivery of at times almost comical lines that still fit in with the dark drama atmosphere which gives it an undeniable creep factor. Stripped down Fargo is still a crime drama but it is one done right. With stellar acting and a script to match it adds a quirky creep to the dark story. Everything fits together in a world unfamiliar yet normal in this homespun murder story.

    Fargo is a film a film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is about the a very simple crime going horribly wrong. The film opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, entering into an arrangement with Carl Showalter, played by Steve Buscemi, and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Peter Stormare. The arrangement is for Carl and Gaear to abduct Jerry's wife, Jean, and hold her for ransom. The deal is supposed to involve no violence, and they are told they will get $40,000 in addition to a brand new vehicle. This should be a fairly simple plan, as Jean's father clearly has the means to pay the ransom, but this simple plan goes horribly wrong. This movie, as almost all, has multiple themes.

Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic. This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota. Yaaaah. That was funny fer sher. Yaaaah. I forgive the Coen brothers. It's actually good that this wasn't really based on a true story. It makes the movie easier to laugh at. (7/10).

    So Argo has no major stars and well known stars still the film shines and gave the actors some reputation in the film business and respect. And the most important job was for the director Joel Coen who had chosen great actors for their role was brilliant and mind-blowing like William H. Macy who played Jerry Lundegaard a car's salesman manager own by his father in law in Minnesota and wanted to start a new businese and has a lack amount of sums to start on a businese and planned to pay 40,000 and a car to Carl Snowalter played by Steve Buscemi and Gaear Grimsrud played by Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife and ask his father in law 1 million dollars. Steve Buscemi played a delightful and a strong role and it was his ever the best role in this film and the energy of his speech delivery was unbelievably done and had matched the character correctly and lastly for Peter Stormare's role was much mature and he really got so in to the role that it was like its his real life attitude and I was so great full to watch this film it's a mind-blowing crime classic that I ever watch.And if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it and It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness.

    This is probably one of the most bittersweet pictures I've seen. Bitter, because I always felt it's a rather bleak and disturbing affair, but rendered sweet thanks to the colorful group of characters and their amusing banter (which is nicely emphasized with all those accents they have there, don'tcha know?). Parts of this film are pretty amusing, but parts of it are pretty sad. The whole affair is a funny-but-sad case. This story is pieced together from a couple of real-life cases, but populated with fictional characters. It's a pretty simple set-up: a man arranges to have his own wife kidnapped, hoping to weasel money from her father in the form of a ransom. What should be a simple and painless situation becomes a total disaster, because nearly every character thinks they know what they're doing and they think they're so hot, but they're all really inept. A series of mishaps and bad decisions causes a cascade of murders and a rather tragic outcome. Well, heck, the final scene is one of the bloodiest and messed-up things conceivable. As crazy and funny as it is to see things deteriorate over stupid mistakes, it is a sobering reflection on crime, greed, and humanity overall. I think the cop sums it up well at the end, for after running through the situation, she asks, "and for what? For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Dontcha know that?" All that being said, I feel the story does take one too many random tangents. A lot of screen time is spent on the cop's personal life, which never really has much relevance to the case. I suppose it's perfect for showing a little more humanity on screen, and to contrast directly with the other guy's family. However, I do believe these extraneous scenes slow down the pacing a lot, and sidetracks from the main story. This film has good, straightforward photography and editing. Acting is effectively perfect from the whole cast, and the writing is good. This production uses very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Carter Burwell's music score is haunting, dramatic, and beautiful all at once. This film has garnered its share of acclaim for darn good reasons. I always believed it could be a tighter film, but it is still well worth seeing for its great cast, its distinctive dialogue (complete with accents), and its ability to instill feelings of amusement and sorrow. Recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    The Coen brothers really deliver this time with Fargo, a murder story with quirky overtones and a flawless script that really sells the character interaction in an otherworld reality of sorts. Don't write the acting off for no 'big names', the actors all play their roles to perfection and sell the script with their excellent delivery of at times almost comical lines that still fit in with the dark drama atmosphere which gives it an undeniable creep factor. Stripped down Fargo is still a crime drama but it is one done right. With stellar acting and a script to match it adds a quirky creep to the dark story. Everything fits together in a world unfamiliar yet normal in this homespun murder story.

    Fargo is a film a film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is about the a very simple crime going horribly wrong. The film opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, entering into an arrangement with Carl Showalter, played by Steve Buscemi, and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Peter Stormare. The arrangement is for Carl and Gaear to abduct Jerry's wife, Jean, and hold her for ransom. The deal is supposed to involve no violence, and they are told they will get $40,000 in addition to a brand new vehicle. This should be a fairly simple plan, as Jean's father clearly has the means to pay the ransom, but this simple plan goes horribly wrong. This movie, as almost all, has multiple themes. Jerry's problems all develop due to his spinelessness, ineffectiveness, and general inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions. One of the themes of the film is that there are consequences of hiding sin. Jerry has a serious embezzling problem, and frankly it is never explained where he is spending this enormous sum of money. The movie elaborate that he is in immediate need of at least $320,000 due to GMAC discovering money he stole. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he constructs this insane plan to have Carl and Gaear kidnap his wife and hold her hostage to get his father-in-law's money. Jerry is so ineffective that he doesn't even show up on-time for his meeting with Carl and Gaear. Instead of admitting to his father-in-law that he stole $320,000, he tries to arrange a real-estate deal with him. Instead of planning through this business deal properly, his father-in-law assumes Jerry just wants a finder's fee for bringing the deal to him. This is further proof of Jerry's extreme spinelessness and ineptness Jerry is so incompetent that he fails to talk his father out of dropping off the money to the kidnappers. This is a disastrous consequence that results from the fact that he is concealing the theft of the money and his plan to cover up the theft. Jerry's entire plan for the crime was to take $1 million from his father-in-law, and give the kidnappers he hired $80,000. This idea is completely ruined when his father-in-law takes the money to the kidnappers instead of Jerry. Jerry further causes pain by ineptly allowing Wade to go through with this. The consequence of this is that Wade is killed by Carl, and an innocent parking lot attendant. These are direct consequences of Jerry being a bungling fool. The further theme of the film is that sin quickly escalates into greater sin. Carl and Gaear are engaged in the crime of kidnapping Jerry's wife, and they quickly escalate this. The initial choice to take part in this evil activity causes a state trooper to stop them. Gaear then kills the state trooper, but there are witnesses to this that unluckily decided to drive by at the wrong time. Gaear then kills those witnesses. Thus, what starts as a simple non-violent abduction turns into a triple homicide. This is just the beginning of the cycle. The triple homicide creates further despair when Carl kills Wade and the parking lot attendant. This shows the continuing cycle of crime creating more crime. The cycle continues when Gaear kills Jerry's wife and Carl. This cycle of crime creating more crime doesn't stop until Marge, a police officer, confronts Gaear as he is stuffing Carl into a wood chipper. Overall, this film is quite strong. It shows a superior effort went into the film. It is very effective at conveying its message. It is well directed, well edited, and highly effective. On the negative side, I question the point of hiding Jerry's motive for stealing all of this money. Explaining his scheme to steal money from GMAC would also be appreciated. This film is only 98 minutes long, and thus, has more than sufficient time to explain Jerry's motive for stealing this money. I do not see how this helps accomplish the film's ultimate intent. Other than that, I would say it is a very strong film. Overall, I would rate it a 9 out of 10.
