    Another wonderful addition into the 3 Ninjas series. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. Some audiences did like this addition, but it was amazing film like the other 3 Ninjas movies. 3 Ninjas are awesome totally. Great selection on bring the legend Hulk Hogan into the picture he was cool. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was also a classic and really good kids family film. A kick-butt action-comedy-family film. The boys, Mathew Botuchis, Michael J. O'Laskey II, and J.P. Roeske II were so awesome in this addition. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was so funny and full of true Martial Arts. Victor Wong who starred as Grandpa he did great and connected very well with the boys in this addition. Sean McNamara who directed film. Great work! Sean McNamara and Jeff Phillips thanks for writing such a amazing kick-butt story. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain rocks! We all remember watching the 3 Ninjas films as a kid and watching them via Television whenever they showed. 3 Ninjas was always a joy to watch because they kick-butt. There's nothing negative about the films itself. I recommend them for everyone and you should check them out if you haven't today. If you love them you'll love this one too. 3 Ninjas will forever rock your world. These boys are cool.

    Sometimes, I'm my own worst enemy. The paradox of being a movie critic is that when you encounter a movie that you know from others is gonna suck like no other, you find your interest growing and you make yourself watch it. But no more. After this, I've learnt my lesson - this was so bad that I've decided never to indulge my masochistic side ever again. All the signs were there - none of the returning cast (this is apparently the fourth movie in this franchise), Hulk Hogan topping the bill and a resolute grip on a place on IMDb's bottom 100. I should have seen this coming and to some extent, I did. But like "Batman & Robin" and "GI Joe: The Rise Of Cobra", I was quite unprepared for just how mind-numbingly boring and poorly made this family movie actually is. In case any of the others have passed you by, three young boys by the name of Rocky (Mathew Botuchis), Colt (Michael O'Laskey II) and Tum Tum (James Paul Roeske II) spend their summers training to become ninja with their grandpa (Victor Wong) with the apparent blessing of their parents (Alan McRae and Margarita Franco). When Tum Tum's favourite TV show is cancelled, they head off to nearby Mega Mountain theme park when Dave Dragon (Hogan) makes a living in a live stage-show version of his show. But terrorists led by the glamorous Medusa (Loni Anderson) take over the park in an attempt to raise some ill-gotten funds from the park's owner (Denis Berkfeldt). Only the 3 Ninjas, together with their new neighbour's daughter Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine), can save the day! I understand that most family films have a lesser quality to their bigger-budgeted brethren but even so, "3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain" is a shocking waste of time, celluloid and talent. Not Hogan, obviously - he speaks most lines with the same level of interest as a train tannoy announcer - but Botuchis actually looks the part and even convinces in the fight scenes. The other two are hopeless but at least they match the same level as their adult co-stars. Anderson comes across as a cut-price version of her namesake Pamela while Jim Varney is wasted as her unfortunate right-hand man Lothar. The rest of the supporting cast are blighted by tragic lookalikes - the cop looked suspiciously like OJ Simpson while I was sure one of the goofy henchmen was actually Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones! Still, this film maintains the laws of kids battling adults laid out in films like "Home Alone" which clearly state that any adult can be incapacitated by violence so long as it is comic. So minor falls onto soft landings, mishaps at various fairground attractions and Jackie Chan-style prop use are all that's really required at any stage. I could go into greater detail about stuff I didn't like by listing things like a barely coherent plot that feels optional at times or a horrible sense when watching it that you're wasting your life perhaps. But I rise above such petty statements and besides, I reckon you get the picture by now. Even with the youngest of boys who believe everything they see in WWE programming, "3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain" won't do the trick. It's too dumb for younger viewers to enjoy and way too stupid for the rest of us. There are worse films out there - another Hogan family film from '98 by the name of "McCinsey's Island" has the dubious distinction of being one of the lowest scoring films I've ever seen - but why does Hollywood produce such poor movies that are meant for kids? Pixar can produce movies suitable for both adults and kids seemingly at will while the likes of Wallace & Gromit provide endlessly entertaining outings and have done for years. This, by contrast, feels as much fun as a detention. But at least I've not wasted my time completely by seeing this - learn from my experience, trust your instincts and keep the hell away from this turgid, unintelligent and frankly forgettable swansong for the 3 Ninjas.

    I reviewed this title back in November 2008, about 4 years ago, and while I still come to the conclusion that this movie still gets a rating of 1 because of how ridiculously bad it is, upon seeing it a few more times, I have to dig deeper into this movie and provide some more thoughts and ideas about it. First off, if you've seen the movie, Skip the next paragraph. In the recent years of the 3 Ninjas, They've grown older and more mature, and because of this, their interest in being ninjas has taken a backseat to more older things. While Tum-tum is still a young boy, Rocky has moved onto girlfriends, and Colt is merely stuck in the middle. Not only that, Tum-tum's Favorite Saturday morning hero, Dave Dragon, is about to cancel his 15-year long superhero show, due to low ratings and loss of interest. His final appearance will be at the Mega mountain theme park on tum-tum's birthday. So Tum-tum wants to go, and his older brothers tag along with their new friend, Amanda, who seems to be an expert on Computer Programming, hacking, and complex electronics. while at the theme park, a group of mercenary Ninjas, led by escaped convict, Mary Ann rogers, AKA Medusa, take over the theme park and threaten to harm it's people, but will let them go in exchange for a large sum of money. Will they succeed in their evildoing, or will the 3 ninjas save the day? OK, Upon seeing this movie a few more times and reading other comments left by users, There's lots to say now. First and foremost, i see 2 obvious references to mid-90s Role Playing games - First, look at Colt's hair. not only does it look ridiculous, it's a bad rip-off of Hero-class Bowie from shining force II, A sega Genesis RPG from 1994. Also, look at Amanda. Doesn't her character seem familiar to another girl from a 1995 SNES RPG? she does have thick glasses, knows her way around complex electronics and computers - Kinda like Lucca from Chrono Trigger maybe? Secondly, kids movies of the 90's can be totally remembered for kids outsmarting adults and leaving a trail of laughter in their wake. It started with Home alone, from 1990. Then it carried throughout the 90s, but around the mid-to-late 90s, the clich&eacute; got really old. this movie feeds off that clich&eacute; like Michael Moore feeds off of McDonalds. Thirdly, The aged stars of our show. First there's Hulk Hogan. Now i love wrestling, to me, it's entertainment and should not be looked at as a legitimate sport, cause it's not. Hulkamania was still running wild for the hulk at the time, he was in his 40s (if this was filmed in 1997, released in 1998, and hulk was born in 1953, he would've been 44 years old. For the most part, his acting isn't really believable, but his larger than life character in the ring more than makes up for it. then we have our other aged star, Loni Anderson. this was a few years after her divorce with Burt Reynolds, and i gotta admit, with all the leather, the make-up, lipstick, and sexy cougar voice, I was still turned on to her. How old was she around the time of filming? Well, she was born in 1945, making her 52 around the time of filming. Hot damn! But her acting skills in this film are as follows... Fourth, Loni Anderson might as well have starred in a porno, cause her acting skills, are totally unbelievable. And adding onto another user's comment, The Dialogue between Loni and Chelsey (Amanda) feels like watching a lesbian porno, about an aged beauty queen wanting to have her way with a young woman. So the bottom line, 3 Ninjas; High Noon at Mega Mountain isn't what you'd call a memorable film, i'd prefer the term "Boring Saturday afternoon fare." it's totally forgettable, the only reason i'll ever remember it is because Loni Anderson was a total cougar in it. I'd rather remember hulk hogan for his Wrestling matches. 1/10

    If I were to describe this film in one word, it would be "clich&eacute;". Since one word reviews are not allowed, I will have to elaborate. It seems the film makers were unable to think of anything original and just threw in every kids film gimmick they could find, except for cute animals that is. We have the classic conflict between older siblings wanting to be cool and the younger ones acting like kids. We have the three bumbling bad guys who get beaten up by little kids. We have the phony TV superhero becoming an actual hero. We have bad guys with guns who seem to never use them, nd if they do they never hit anyone. The list goes on and on, however there are other kids movies that do all of these things so much better, in 3 Ninjas it just becomes corny. The only original thing (not counting the other 3 Ninja films) is the fighting but that ends up being nothing but several minutes of three kids repeatedly shouting "Ai-ya". This clearly suffers being a sequel produced solely to cash in on the franchise. I say, go see the first one and skip this.

    3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain starts as a young girl named Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine) & her family move into their new home in Hidden Shores, they are welcomed to the neighbourhood by brother's Colt (Michael O' Laskey II), TumTum (James Paul Roeske II) & Rocky (Mathew Botuchis) who are all going to an amusement park named Mega Mountain that afternoon & invite Amanda to join them. While at the theme park the three ninja brother's & Amanda become aware that it has been taken over by a group of thieves, armed with guns & in complete control of Mega Mountain they hold the owner to ransom. The three ninja brother's decide to fight back & with the help of ageing television action hero Dave Dragon (Hulk Hogan) take on the criminals, can they save the day or will the bad guy's win? Co-written & directed by Sean McNamara this rather violent & childish slapstick action comedy that isn't particularly great & pretty silly at times but I found it passed the time if nothing else. The script is a sort of childish Die Hard (1989) but instead of ruthless criminals there are bumbling bad guy's, instead of the high rise building they take over an amusement park, instead of a tough cop hero there are three bratty child ninjas & their geek female friend & instead of a wisecracking Bruce Willis we get a tired looking Hulk Hogan as a washed-up television star (art imitating life maybe?). Here in the UK this film was quite heavily cut by around four minutes for scenes of nunchukas, head butts, ear claps & a kid wetting himself & having just seen the uncut version I am not sure what to make of it, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is definitely aimed at a young audience with it's silly slapstick action & childish humour so the high levels of violence did sit a little uneasily with me. From the head butts to kicks & punches to sword fights & even a scene in which a young boy throw's darts at a man. Just think about how incredibly dangerous that is for a minute, seriously if someone threw a dart at you & it hit you in the face you would be in big trouble & another worrying aspect of 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is that none of this violence ever has any consequence. The guy who gets a dart thrown at him just catches it in his mouth, punches, kicks & being pushed off rooftops seem to cause no sort of injury to anyone & maybe it would have been better if the makers did emphasise how dangerous these techniques are. As an action comedy it moves along at a decent pace, it's silly & not particularly coherent (where did Amanda get that remote control helicopter from at the end? Why is everyone at the park enjoying themselves it being run by armed criminals?) & it's pretty predictable & safe in that the good guy's win & the bad guy's lose. The fights are played mostly for laughs with bumbling bad guy's being beaten up by kids, there's an exploding boat at the end & not much else in the way of action. One also has to say that Mega Mountain amusement park has some really lack security, I mean Amaanda manages to take explosives, razor sharp throwing cards, a razor bladed yo-yo & a remote control helicopter inside her backpack. Mega Mountain also seems to have many brilliantly placed CCTV cameras that track exactly what armed criminals want & from perfect angles. Filmed at Elitch Gardens amusement park in Denver in Colorado, rather sloppily made with poor continuity & lacklustre production values. The acting isn't great, the three ninja kids are terrible while Hulk Hogan seems bored & Loni Anderson is the main highlight as the whip cracking leather clad Medusa but what is someone dressed like that doing in a kids film? 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is a silly & childish action comedy that is probably a bit too violent for a film aimed at children & implies that violence has no consequence. I suppose it passes the time & as a silly Die Hard style kids comedy I thought it was watchable.

    The only reason I bought this DVD is because I'm such a fan of Varney's. I wouldn't have known about this movie much less get it if he wasn't in it. While lots of people rag on Hulk Hogan, he wasn't the worst actor. By far, the most wooden performance goes to Loni Anderson. If this is a family oriented movie, why in the world did they have her dress in that skanky leather outfit that was far too short? Terrible casting as far as Loni goes. She was supposed to be the evil Medusa but I didn't buy it. She just didn't have the quality of pulling off the 'bad guy' type of role. She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. I got a little tired of Tum Tum's 'Ay-yahs' after a while. They were too high pitched and over done. All 6 stars go to Jim Varney. I was actually rooting for Lothar to become successful in his mission for he was the only one of the bad guys with the brilliance to pull off the heist. He easily outshone all the stars, as usual. He always gives 100% to whatever role he played as you can see here. Jim and Victor were the two best actors in this movie. Maybe if Jim had cast and directed this, it would've been a bigger box office success. The man was a brilliant actor and a genius. If you're a fan of Varney's, then yes, get the movie just to watch him. Otherwise, don't bother.

    I have seen a lot of movies, old and new, good and bad. 3 Ninjas:High Noon at Mega Mountain is a really awful movie, not the all-time worst, but everything that makes a bad movie bad is in abundance in this wretched excuse of a movie. In fact, the only somewhat tolerable asset was the soundtrack, that was decent compared to how awful everything else was. What made the movie especially bad was the plot. It is incredibly lame and predictable, with one of the dumbest endings I have seen in recent memory. Production values-wise, the movie is not good either, the cinematography, sets and scenery are of shoddy quality and the editing is so slip-shod it hurts the eyes and makes the editing in a movie like The Medallion seem Oscar-worthy. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed with little or no drive or energy, while the script and direction are terrible. Same with the acting, the kids are all annoying, the villains are pathetic in both character and acting while Hulk Hogan has a poor character and is not given much to do. Overall, an awful film and not worth it. 1/10 Bethany Cox

    Hasn't anyone ever dreamed of being a ninja as a child? I watched this movie years ago and would have told you then that the 3 ninjas movies were the absolute best movies ever made. Looking at this movie from an adults perspective defeats the propose of this being a Children's MOVIE. From a child's perspective this movie is one of the best martial arts movies ever made. Think back to when you were a kid. Wouldn't you love to see a movie where kids your age can take on fully grown men and win? This movie was a favorite of mine growing up and I would still sit down and watch all of the 3 ninjas movies because they were so epic as a child.

    That math problem sums up this whole movie. It is "The Karate Kid" divided into three smaller karate kids. Then you times that by zero effort and you get one big fat goose egg of a movie. It is the fourth installment in the 3 Ninjas saga, and it is by far the worst. The other films I will review in time, but this is the big one. This is the one that everyone hates. It has terrible acting, terrible fight scenes, and an awful story. When it comes to the acting the only person I liked was Jim Varney, but that is not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. As you would expect the child acting fails completely. The 3 ninjas are all annoying especially the little one. As for Hulk Hogan I didn't hate the performance, but it is exactly what you would expect. Then we have the action which is terrible. It goes for fighting that is practically slapstick instead of actual fighting. That is something I hate about a lot of kung fu/karate movies. So many of them just go for laughs from kiddies instead of actual honor for the fighting. It insults it, and if I was a karate teacher I would spit on pieces of trash like this everyday. In my opinion martial arts should stay in the more adult categories. The only true exception I have seen for these largely kid friendly martial arts movies is "The Karate Kid" that's it. I can't wait for a day when another film like that comes around and shows kids what the art of combat is about instead of constant shots to the balls. Until then we get this. Also another thing terrible about the fighting that is unbearable is how they have weapons with knives, but they never use them. I know it's for kids, but if there is a terrorist in front of you and you have a knife that guy is getting stabbed. Have stabbing or lose the knives in my opinion. Also the fighting suffers from those clich&eacute; noises that are made when you make a punch. It gets really annoying quickly. Now we move on to the plot. It really all seems like an excuse to have Hulk Hogan. They might as well call it "Hulk and 3 Ninjas". He was what sold the film in the first place, but I am going to try and explain the plot. The ninjas go to an amusement park, and it gets taken over by terrorists. The only hope is the 3 ninjas, a smart girl with glasses, and Hulk Hogan......(3 hours of laughing later) Yeah that is one of the lamest excuses for a plot I have ever seen. Then we have dialogue which just like the fighting suffers from way to much childish humor. The jokes are very repetitive. The movie just isn't funny. I'm not going to give this film a 0 star rating. It's bad, but at least it isn't "Pocket Ninjas". Just saying the title of that movie makes me shiver. 1/2 of a star out of 4

    Uggh! This is a terrible film and this was obvious by the first scene. The film begins with three very white-bread kids being taught by their grandfather how to be ninjas in some sort of Mario Brothers-like training facility. Considering how similar all this looks to "Pocket Ninjas" (the #4 lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), I knew I was in for a painful time! Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!! And, oh God say it isn't so, it's up to the thee kids AND Hulk Hogan to save the day. Can it get any worse?!?! Well, with tons of lame stunts, tons of special effects and minimal acting, the answer is YES! To show the FBI that they mean business, once the baddies take over the park, they make certain rides go SLIGHTLY faster!!! What beasts!! In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents. Because of this and the constantly insipid writing, the film is a total bore to anyone older than about 6. So should this movie be on the infamous Bottom 100 list? I think probably not for two reasons. First, very, very young kids will enjoy this insipid crap--and to me, a film should not be on the list if it is in any way enjoyable. Second, the production values are not that terrible and the film makes no attempt to be anything more than it is--a dopey little film that would most likely make a parent kill themselves or the kids if they are forced to watch it!!

It's too dumb for younger viewers to enjoy and way too stupid for the rest of us. There are worse films out there - another Hogan family film from '98 by the name of "McCinsey's Island" has the dubious distinction of being one of the lowest scoring films I've ever seen - but why does Hollywood produce such poor movies that are meant for kids? Pixar can produce movies suitable for both adults and kids seemingly at will while the likes of Wallace & Gromit provide endlessly entertaining outings and have done for years. This, by contrast, feels as much fun as a detention. But at least I've not wasted my time completely by seeing this - learn from my experience, trust your instincts and keep the hell away from this turgid, unintelligent and frankly forgettable swansong for the 3 Ninjas.

    I reviewed this title back in November 2008, about 4 years ago, and while I still come to the conclusion that this movie still gets a rating of 1 because of how ridiculously bad it is, upon seeing it a few more times, I have to dig deeper into this movie and provide some more thoughts and ideas about it. First off, if you've seen the movie, Skip the next paragraph. In the recent years of the 3 Ninjas, They've grown older and more mature, and because of this, their interest in being ninjas has taken a backseat to more older things. While Tum-tum is still a young boy, Rocky has moved onto girlfriends, and Colt is merely stuck in the middle. Not only that, Tum-tum's Favorite Saturday morning hero, Dave Dragon, is about to cancel his 15-year long superhero show, due to low ratings and loss of interest. His final appearance will be at the Mega mountain theme park on tum-tum's birthday. So Tum-tum wants to go, and his older brothers tag along with their new friend, Amanda, who seems to be an expert on Computer Programming, hacking, and complex electronics. while at the theme park, a group of mercenary Ninjas, led by escaped convict, Mary Ann rogers, AKA Medusa, take over the theme park and threaten to harm it's people, but will let them go in exchange for a large sum of money. Will they succeed in their evildoing, or will the 3 ninjas save the day? OK, Upon seeing this movie a few more times and reading other comments left by users, There's lots to say now. First and foremost, i see 2 obvious references to mid-90s Role Playing games - First, look at Colt's hair. not only does it look ridiculous, it's a bad rip-off of Hero-class Bowie from shining force II, A sega Genesis RPG from 1994. Also, look at Amanda. Doesn't her character seem familiar to another girl from a 1995 SNES RPG? she does have thick glasses, knows her way around complex electronics and computers - Kinda like Lucca from Chrono Trigger maybe? Secondly, kids movies of the 90's can be totally remembered for kids outsmarting adults and leaving a trail of laughter in their wake. It started with Home alone, from 1990. Then it carried throughout the 90s, but around the mid-to-late 90s, the clich&eacute; got really old. this movie feeds off that clich&eacute; like Michael Moore feeds off of McDonalds. Thirdly, The aged stars of our show. First there's Hulk Hogan. Now i love wrestling, to me, it's entertainment and should not be looked at as a legitimate sport, cause it's not. Hulkamania was still running wild for the hulk at the time, he was in his 40s (if this was filmed in 1997, released in 1998, and hulk was born in 1953, he would've been 44 years old. For the most part, his acting isn't really believable, but his larger than life character in the ring more than makes up for it. then we have our other aged star, Loni Anderson. this was a few years after her divorce with Burt Reynolds, and i gotta admit, with all the leather, the make-up, lipstick, and sexy cougar voice, I was still turned on to her. How old was she around the time of filming? Well, she was born in 1945, making her 52 around the time of filming. Hot damn! But her acting skills in this film are as follows... Fourth, Loni Anderson might as well have starred in a porno, cause her acting skills, are totally unbelievable. And adding onto another user's comment, The Dialogue between Loni and Chelsey (Amanda) feels like watching a lesbian porno, about an aged beauty queen wanting to have her way with a young woman. So the bottom line, 3 Ninjas; High Noon at Mega Mountain isn't what you'd call a memorable film, i'd prefer the term "Boring Saturday afternoon fare." it's totally forgettable, the only reason i'll ever remember it is because Loni Anderson was a total cougar in it. I'd rather remember hulk hogan for his Wrestling matches. 1/10

    If I were to describe this film in one word, it would be "clich&eacute;". Since one word reviews are not allowed, I will have to elaborate. It seems the film makers were unable to think of anything original and just threw in every kids film gimmick they could find, except for cute animals that is. We have the classic conflict between older siblings wanting to be cool and the younger ones acting like kids. We have the three bumbling bad guys who get beaten up by little kids. We have the phony TV superhero becoming an actual hero. We have bad guys with guns who seem to never use them, nd if they do they never hit anyone. The list goes on and on, however there are other kids movies that do all of these things so much better, in 3 Ninjas it just becomes corny. The only original thing (not counting the other 3 Ninja films) is the fighting but that ends up being nothing but several minutes of three kids repeatedly shouting "Ai-ya". This clearly suffers being a sequel produced solely to cash in on the franchise. I say, go see the first one and skip this.

    3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain starts as a young girl named Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine) & her family move into their new home in Hidden Shores, they are welcomed to the neighbourhood by brother's Colt (Michael O' Laskey II), TumTum (James Paul Roeske II) & Rocky (Mathew Botuchis) who are all going to an amusement park named Mega Mountain that afternoon & invite Amanda to join them. While at the theme park the three ninja brother's & Amanda become aware that it has been taken over by a group of thieves, armed with guns & in complete control of Mega Mountain they hold the owner to ransom. The three ninja brother's decide to fight back & with the help of ageing television action hero Dave Dragon (Hulk Hogan) take on the criminals, can they save the day or will the bad guy's win? Co-written & directed by Sean McNamara this rather violent & childish slapstick action comedy that isn't particularly great & pretty silly at times but I found it passed the time if nothing else. The script is a sort of childish Die Hard (1989) but instead of ruthless criminals there are bumbling bad guy's, instead of the high rise building they take over an amusement park, instead of a tough cop hero there are three bratty child ninjas & their geek female friend & instead of a wisecracking Bruce Willis we get a tired looking Hulk Hogan as a washed-up television star (art imitating life maybe?). Here in the UK this film was quite heavily cut by around four minutes for scenes of nunchukas, head butts, ear claps & a kid wetting himself & having just seen the uncut version I am not sure what to make of it, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is definitely aimed at a young audience with it's silly slapstick action & childish humour so the high levels of violence did sit a little uneasily with me. From the head butts to kicks & punches to sword fights & even a scene in which a young boy throw's darts at a man. Just think about how incredibly dangerous that is for a minute, seriously if someone threw a dart at you & it hit you in the face you would be in big trouble & another worrying aspect of 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is that none of this violence ever has any consequence. The guy who gets a dart thrown at him just catches it in his mouth, punches, kicks & being pushed off rooftops seem to cause no sort of injury to anyone & maybe it would have been better if the makers did emphasise how dangerous these techniques are. As an action comedy it moves along at a decent pace, it's silly & not particularly coherent (where did Amanda get that remote control helicopter from at the end? Why is everyone at the park enjoying themselves it being run by armed criminals?) & it's pretty predictable & safe in that the good guy's win & the bad guy's lose. The fights are played mostly for laughs with bumbling bad guy's being beaten up by kids, there's an exploding boat at the end & not much else in the way of action. One also has to say that Mega Mountain amusement park has some really lack security, I mean Amaanda manages to take explosives, razor sharp throwing cards, a razor bladed yo-yo & a remote control helicopter inside her backpack. Mega Mountain also seems to have many brilliantly placed CCTV cameras that track exactly what armed criminals want & from perfect angles. Filmed at Elitch Gardens amusement park in Denver in Colorado, rather sloppily made with poor continuity & lacklustre production values. The acting isn't great, the three ninja kids are terrible while Hulk Hogan seems bored & Loni Anderson is the main highlight as the whip cracking leather clad Medusa but what is someone dressed like that doing in a kids film? 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is a silly & childish action comedy that is probably a bit too violent for a film aimed at children & implies that violence has no consequence. I suppose it passes the time & as a silly Die Hard style kids comedy I thought it was watchable.

    The only reason I bought this DVD is because I'm such a fan of Varney's. I wouldn't have known about this movie much less get it if he wasn't in it. While lots of people rag on Hulk Hogan, he wasn't the worst actor. By far, the most wooden performance goes to Loni Anderson. If this is a family oriented movie, why in the world did they have her dress in that skanky leather outfit that was far too short? Terrible casting as far as Loni goes. She was supposed to be the evil Medusa but I didn't buy it. She just didn't have the quality of pulling off the 'bad guy' type of role. She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. I got a little tired of Tum Tum's 'Ay-yahs' after a while. They were too high pitched and over done. All 6 stars go to Jim Varney. I was actually rooting for Lothar to become successful in his mission for he was the only one of the bad guys with the brilliance to pull off the heist. He easily outshone all the stars, as usual. He always gives 100% to whatever role he played as you can see here. Jim and Victor were the two best actors in this movie. Maybe if Jim had cast and directed this, it would've been a bigger box office success. The man was a brilliant actor and a genius. If you're a fan of Varney's, then yes, get the movie just to watch him. Otherwise, don't bother.

    I have seen a lot of movies, old and new, good and bad. 3 Ninjas:High Noon at Mega Mountain is a really awful movie, not the all-time worst, but everything that makes a bad movie bad is in abundance in this wretched excuse of a movie. In fact, the only somewhat tolerable asset was the soundtrack, that was decent compared to how awful everything else was. What made the movie especially bad was the plot. It is incredibly lame and predictable, with one of the dumbest endings I have seen in recent memory. Production values-wise, the movie is not good either, the cinematography, sets and scenery are of shoddy quality and the editing is so slip-shod it hurts the eyes and makes the editing in a movie like The Medallion seem Oscar-worthy. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed with little or no drive or energy, while the script and direction are terrible. Same with the acting, the kids are all annoying, the villains are pathetic in both character and acting while Hulk Hogan has a poor character and is not given much to do. Overall, an awful film and not worth it. 1/10 Bethany Cox

    Hasn't anyone ever dreamed of being a ninja as a child? I watched this movie years ago and would have told you then that the 3 ninjas movies were the absolute best movies ever made. Looking at this movie from an adults perspective defeats the propose of this being a Children's MOVIE. From a child's perspective this movie is one of the best martial arts movies ever made. Think back to when you were a kid. Wouldn't you love to see a movie where kids your age can take on fully grown men and win? This movie was a favorite of mine growing up and I would still sit down and watch all of the 3 ninjas movies because they were so epic as a child.

    That math problem sums up this whole movie. It is "The Karate Kid" divided into three smaller karate kids. Then you times that by zero effort and you get one big fat goose egg of a movie. It is the fourth installment in the 3 Ninjas saga, and it is by far the worst. The other films I will review in time, but this is the big one. This is the one that everyone hates. It has terrible acting, terrible fight scenes, and an awful story. When it comes to the acting the only person I liked was Jim Varney, but that is not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. As you would expect the child acting fails completely. The 3 ninjas are all annoying especially the little one. As for Hulk Hogan I didn't hate the performance, but it is exactly what you would expect. Then we have the action which is terrible. It goes for fighting that is practically slapstick instead of actual fighting. That is something I hate about a lot of kung fu/karate movies. So many of them just go for laughs from kiddies instead of actual honor for the fighting. It insults it, and if I was a karate teacher I would spit on pieces of trash like this everyday. In my opinion martial arts should stay in the more adult categories. The only true exception I have seen for these largely kid friendly martial arts movies is "The Karate Kid" that's it. I can't wait for a day when another film like that comes around and shows kids what the art of combat is about instead of constant shots to the balls. Until then we get this. Also another thing terrible about the fighting that is unbearable is how they have weapons with knives, but they never use them. I know it's for kids, but if there is a terrorist in front of you and you have a knife that guy is getting stabbed. Have stabbing or lose the knives in my opinion. Also the fighting suffers from those clich&eacute; noises that are made when you make a punch. It gets really annoying quickly. Now we move on to the plot. It really all seems like an excuse to have Hulk Hogan. They might as well call it "Hulk and 3 Ninjas". He was what sold the film in the first place, but I am going to try and explain the plot. The ninjas go to an amusement park, and it gets taken over by terrorists. The only hope is the 3 ninjas, a smart girl with glasses, and Hulk Hogan......(3 hours of laughing later) Yeah that is one of the lamest excuses for a plot I have ever seen. Then we have dialogue which just like the fighting suffers from way to much childish humor. The jokes are very repetitive. The movie just isn't funny. I'm not going to give this film a 0 star rating. It's bad, but at least it isn't "Pocket Ninjas". Just saying the title of that movie makes me shiver. 1/2 of a star out of 4

    Uggh! This is a terrible film and this was obvious by the first scene. The film begins with three very white-bread kids being taught by their grandfather how to be ninjas in some sort of Mario Brothers-like training facility. Considering how similar all this looks to "Pocket Ninjas" (the #4 lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), I knew I was in for a painful time! Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!! And, oh God say it isn't so, it's up to the thee kids AND Hulk Hogan to save the day. Can it get any worse?!?! Well, with tons of lame stunts, tons of special effects and minimal acting, the answer is YES! To show the FBI that they mean business, once the baddies take over the park, they make certain rides go SLIGHTLY faster!!! What beasts!! In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents. Because of this and the constantly insipid writing, the film is a total bore to anyone older than about 6. So should this movie be on the infamous Bottom 100 list? I think probably not for two reasons. First, very, very young kids will enjoy this insipid crap--and to me, a film should not be on the list if it is in any way enjoyable. Second, the production values are not that terrible and the film makes no attempt to be anything more than it is--a dopey little film that would most likely make a parent kill themselves or the kids if they are forced to watch it!!

    Another wonderful addition into the 3 Ninjas series. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. Some audiences did like this addition, but it was amazing film like the other 3 Ninjas movies. 3 Ninjas are awesome totally. Great selection on bring the legend Hulk Hogan into the picture he was cool. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was also a classic and really good kids family film. A kick-butt action-comedy-family film. The boys, Mathew Botuchis, Michael J. O'Laskey II, and J.P. Roeske II were so awesome in this addition. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was so funny and full of true Martial Arts. Victor Wong who starred as Grandpa he did great and connected very well with the boys in this addition. Sean McNamara who directed film. Great work! Sean McNamara and Jeff Phillips thanks for writing such a amazing kick-butt story. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain rocks! We all remember watching the 3 Ninjas films as a kid and watching them via Television whenever they showed. 3 Ninjas was always a joy to watch because they kick-butt. There's nothing negative about the films itself. I recommend them for everyone and you should check them out if you haven't today. If you love them you'll love this one too. 3 Ninjas will forever rock your world. These boys are cool.

    Sometimes, I'm my own worst enemy. The paradox of being a movie critic is that when you encounter a movie that you know from others is gonna suck like no other, you find your interest growing and you make yourself watch it. But no more. After this, I've learnt my lesson - this was so bad that I've decided never to indulge my masochistic side ever again. All the signs were there - none of the returning cast (this is apparently the fourth movie in this franchise), Hulk Hogan topping the bill and a resolute grip on a place on IMDb's bottom 100. I should have seen this coming and to some extent, I did. But like "Batman & Robin" and "GI Joe: The Rise Of Cobra", I was quite unprepared for just how mind-numbingly boring and poorly made this family movie actually is. In case any of the others have passed you by, three young boys by the name of Rocky (Mathew Botuchis), Colt (Michael O'Laskey II) and Tum Tum (James Paul Roeske II) spend their summers training to become ninja with their grandpa (Victor Wong) with the apparent blessing of their parents (Alan McRae and Margarita Franco). When Tum Tum's favourite TV show is cancelled, they head off to nearby Mega Mountain theme park when Dave Dragon (Hogan) makes a living in a live stage-show version of his show. But terrorists led by the glamorous Medusa (Loni Anderson) take over the park in an attempt to raise some ill-gotten funds from the park's owner (Denis Berkfeldt). Only the 3 Ninjas, together with their new neighbour's daughter Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine), can save the day! I understand that most family films have a lesser quality to their bigger-budgeted brethren but even so, "3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain" is a shocking waste of time, celluloid and talent. Not Hogan, obviously - he speaks most lines with the same level of interest as a train tannoy announcer - but Botuchis actually looks the part and even convinces in the fight scenes. The other two are hopeless but at least they match the same level as their adult co-stars. Anderson comes across as a cut-price version of her namesake Pamela while Jim Varney is wasted as her unfortunate right-hand man Lothar. The rest of the supporting cast are blighted by tragic lookalikes - the cop looked suspiciously like OJ Simpson while I was sure one of the goofy henchmen was actually Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones! Still, this film maintains the laws of kids battling adults laid out in films like "Home Alone" which clearly state that any adult can be incapacitated by violence so long as it is comic. So minor falls onto soft landings, mishaps at various fairground attractions and Jackie Chan-style prop use are all that's really required at any stage. I could go into greater detail about stuff I didn't like by listing things like a barely coherent plot that feels optional at times or a horrible sense when watching it that you're wasting your life perhaps. But I rise above such petty statements and besides, I reckon you get the picture by now. Even with the youngest of boys who believe everything they see in WWE programming, "3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain" won't do the trick. It's too dumb for younger viewers to enjoy and way too stupid for the rest of us. There are worse films out there - another Hogan family film from '98 by the name of "McCinsey's Island" has the dubious distinction of being one of the lowest scoring films I've ever seen - but why does Hollywood produce such poor movies that are meant for kids? Pixar can produce movies suitable for both adults and kids seemingly at will while the likes of Wallace & Gromit provide endlessly entertaining outings and have done for years. This, by contrast, feels as much fun as a detention. But at least I've not wasted my time completely by seeing this - learn from my experience, trust your instincts and keep the hell away from this turgid, unintelligent and frankly forgettable swansong for the 3 Ninjas.

    3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain starts as a young girl named Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine) & her family move into their new home in Hidden Shores, they are welcomed to the neighbourhood by brother's Colt (Michael O' Laskey II), TumTum (James Paul Roeske II) & Rocky (Mathew Botuchis) who are all going to an amusement park named Mega Mountain that afternoon & invite Amanda to join them. While at the theme park the three ninja brother's & Amanda become aware that it has been taken over by a group of thieves, armed with guns & in complete control of Mega Mountain they hold the owner to ransom. The three ninja brother's decide to fight back & with the help of ageing television action hero Dave Dragon (Hulk Hogan) take on the criminals, can they save the day or will the bad guy's win? Co-written & directed by Sean McNamara this rather violent & childish slapstick action comedy that isn't particularly great & pretty silly at times but I found it passed the time if nothing else. The script is a sort of childish Die Hard (1989) but instead of ruthless criminals there are bumbling bad guy's, instead of the high rise building they take over an amusement park, instead of a tough cop hero there are three bratty child ninjas & their geek female friend & instead of a wisecracking Bruce Willis we get a tired looking Hulk Hogan as a washed-up television star (art imitating life maybe?). Here in the UK this film was quite heavily cut by around four minutes for scenes of nunchukas, head butts, ear claps & a kid wetting himself & having just seen the uncut version I am not sure what to make of it, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is definitely aimed at a young audience with it's silly slapstick action & childish humour so the high levels of violence did sit a little uneasily with me. From the head butts to kicks & punches to sword fights & even a scene in which a young boy throw's darts at a man. Just think about how incredibly dangerous that is for a minute, seriously if someone threw a dart at you & it hit you in the face you would be in big trouble & another worrying aspect of 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is that none of this violence ever has any consequence. The guy who gets a dart thrown at him just catches it in his mouth, punches, kicks & being pushed off rooftops seem to cause no sort of injury to anyone & maybe it would have been better if the makers did emphasise how dangerous these techniques are. As an action comedy it moves along at a decent pace, it's silly & not particularly coherent (where did Amanda get that remote control helicopter from at the end? Why is everyone at the park enjoying themselves it being run by armed criminals?) & it's pretty predictable & safe in that the good guy's win & the bad guy's lose. The fights are played mostly for laughs with bumbling bad guy's being beaten up by kids, there's an exploding boat at the end & not much else in the way of action. One also has to say that Mega Mountain amusement park has some really lack security, I mean Amaanda manages to take explosives, razor sharp throwing cards, a razor bladed yo-yo & a remote control helicopter inside her backpack. Mega Mountain also seems to have many brilliantly placed CCTV cameras that track exactly what armed criminals want & from perfect angles. Filmed at Elitch Gardens amusement park in Denver in Colorado, rather sloppily made with poor continuity & lacklustre production values. The acting isn't great, the three ninja kids are terrible while Hulk Hogan seems bored & Loni Anderson is the main highlight as the whip cracking leather clad Medusa but what is someone dressed like that doing in a kids film? 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is a silly & childish action comedy that is probably a bit too violent for a film aimed at children & implies that violence has no consequence. I suppose it passes the time & as a silly Die Hard style kids comedy I thought it was watchable.

    The only reason I bought this DVD is because I'm such a fan of Varney's. I wouldn't have known about this movie much less get it if he wasn't in it. While lots of people rag on Hulk Hogan, he wasn't the worst actor. By far, the most wooden performance goes to Loni Anderson. If this is a family oriented movie, why in the world did they have her dress in that skanky leather outfit that was far too short? Terrible casting as far as Loni goes. She was supposed to be the evil Medusa but I didn't buy it. She just didn't have the quality of pulling off the 'bad guy' type of role. She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. I got a little tired of Tum Tum's 'Ay-yahs' after a while. They were too high pitched and over done. All 6 stars go to Jim Varney. I was actually rooting for Lothar to become successful in his mission for he was the only one of the bad guys with the brilliance to pull off the heist. He easily outshone all the stars, as usual. He always gives 100% to whatever role he played as you can see here. Jim and Victor were the two best actors in this movie. Maybe if Jim had cast and directed this, it would've been a bigger box office success. The man was a brilliant actor and a genius. If you're a fan of Varney's, then yes, get the movie just to watch him. Otherwise, don't bother.

    I have seen a lot of movies, old and new, good and bad. 3 Ninjas:High Noon at Mega Mountain is a really awful movie, not the all-time worst, but everything that makes a bad movie bad is in abundance in this wretched excuse of a movie. In fact, the only somewhat tolerable asset was the soundtrack, that was decent compared to how awful everything else was. What made the movie especially bad was the plot. It is incredibly lame and predictable, with one of the dumbest endings I have seen in recent memory. Production values-wise, the movie is not good either, the cinematography, sets and scenery are of shoddy quality and the editing is so slip-shod it hurts the eyes and makes the editing in a movie like The Medallion seem Oscar-worthy. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed with little or no drive or energy, while the script and direction are terrible. Same with the acting, the kids are all annoying, the villains are pathetic in both character and acting while Hulk Hogan has a poor character and is not given much to do. Overall, an awful film and not worth it. 1/10 Bethany Cox

    Hasn't anyone ever dreamed of being a ninja as a child? I watched this movie years ago and would have told you then that the 3 ninjas movies were the absolute best movies ever made. Looking at this movie from an adults perspective defeats the propose of this being a Children's MOVIE. From a child's perspective this movie is one of the best martial arts movies ever made. Think back to when you were a kid. Wouldn't you love to see a movie where kids your age can take on fully grown men and win? This movie was a favorite of mine growing up and I would still sit down and watch all of the 3 ninjas movies because they were so epic as a child.

    That math problem sums up this whole movie. It is "The Karate Kid" divided into three smaller karate kids. Then you times that by zero effort and you get one big fat goose egg of a movie. It is the fourth installment in the 3 Ninjas saga, and it is by far the worst. The other films I will review in time, but this is the big one. This is the one that everyone hates. It has terrible acting, terrible fight scenes, and an awful story. When it comes to the acting the only person I liked was Jim Varney, but that is not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. As you would expect the child acting fails completely. The 3 ninjas are all annoying especially the little one. As for Hulk Hogan I didn't hate the performance, but it is exactly what you would expect. Then we have the action which is terrible. It goes for fighting that is practically slapstick instead of actual fighting. That is something I hate about a lot of kung fu/karate movies. So many of them just go for laughs from kiddies instead of actual honor for the fighting. It insults it, and if I was a karate teacher I would spit on pieces of trash like this everyday. In my opinion martial arts should stay in the more adult categories. The only true exception I have seen for these largely kid friendly martial arts movies is "The Karate Kid" that's it. I can't wait for a day when another film like that comes around and shows kids what the art of combat is about instead of constant shots to the balls. Until then we get this. Also another thing terrible about the fighting that is unbearable is how they have weapons with knives, but they never use them. I know it's for kids, but if there is a terrorist in front of you and you have a knife that guy is getting stabbed. Have stabbing or lose the knives in my opinion. Also the fighting suffers from those clich&eacute; noises that are made when you make a punch. It gets really annoying quickly. Now we move on to the plot. It really all seems like an excuse to have Hulk Hogan. They might as well call it "Hulk and 3 Ninjas". He was what sold the film in the first place, but I am going to try and explain the plot. The ninjas go to an amusement park, and it gets taken over by terrorists. The only hope is the 3 ninjas, a smart girl with glasses, and Hulk Hogan......(3 hours of laughing later) Yeah that is one of the lamest excuses for a plot I have ever seen. Then we have dialogue which just like the fighting suffers from way to much childish humor. The jokes are very repetitive. The movie just isn't funny. I'm not going to give this film a 0 star rating. It's bad, but at least it isn't "Pocket Ninjas". Just saying the title of that movie makes me shiver. 1/2 of a star out of 4

    Uggh! This is a terrible film and this was obvious by the first scene. The film begins with three very white-bread kids being taught by their grandfather how to be ninjas in some sort of Mario Brothers-like training facility. Considering how similar all this looks to "Pocket Ninjas" (the #4 lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), I knew I was in for a painful time! Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!! And, oh God say it isn't so, it's up to the thee kids AND Hulk Hogan to save the day. Can it get any worse?!?! Well, with tons of lame stunts, tons of special effects and minimal acting, the answer is YES! To show the FBI that they mean business, once the baddies take over the park, they make certain rides go SLIGHTLY faster!!! What beasts!! In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents. Because of this and the constantly insipid writing, the film is a total bore to anyone older than about 6. So should this movie be on the infamous Bottom 100 list? I think probably not for two reasons. First, very, very young kids will enjoy this insipid crap--and to me, a film should not be on the list if it is in any way enjoyable. Second, the production values are not that terrible and the film makes no attempt to be anything more than it is--a dopey little film that would most likely make a parent kill themselves or the kids if they are forced to watch it!!

    Another wonderful addition into the 3 Ninjas series. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. Some audiences did like this addition, but it was amazing film like the other 3 Ninjas movies. 3 Ninjas are awesome totally. Great selection on bring the legend Hulk Hogan into the picture he was cool. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was also a classic and really good kids family film. A kick-butt action-comedy-family film. The boys, Mathew Botuchis, Michael J. O'Laskey II, and J.P. Roeske II were so awesome in this addition. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was so funny and full of true Martial Arts. Victor Wong who starred as Grandpa he did great and connected very well with the boys in this addition. Sean McNamara who directed film. Great work! Sean McNamara and Jeff Phillips thanks for writing such a amazing kick-butt story. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain rocks! We all remember watching the 3 Ninjas films as a kid and watching them via Television whenever they showed. 3 Ninjas was always a joy to watch because they kick-butt. There's nothing negative about the films itself. I recommend them for everyone and you should check them out if you haven't today. If you love them you'll love this one too. 3 Ninjas will forever rock your world. These boys are cool.

    Sometimes, I'm my own worst enemy. The paradox of being a movie critic is that when you encounter a movie that you know from others is gonna suck like no other, you find your interest growing and you make yourself watch it. But no more. After this, I've learnt my lesson - this was so bad that I've decided never to indulge my masochistic side ever again. All the signs were there - none of the returning cast (this is apparently the fourth movie in this franchise), Hulk Hogan topping the bill and a resolute grip on a place on IMDb's bottom 100. I should have seen this coming and to some extent, I did. But like "Batman & Robin" and "GI Joe: The Rise Of Cobra", I was quite unprepared for just how mind-numbingly boring and poorly made this family movie actually is. In case any of the others have passed you by, three young boys by the name of Rocky (Mathew Botuchis), Colt (Michael O'Laskey II) and Tum Tum (James Paul Roeske II) spend their summers training to become ninja with their grandpa (Victor Wong) with the apparent blessing of their parents (Alan McRae and Margarita Franco). When Tum Tum's favourite TV show is cancelled, they head off to nearby Mega Mountain theme park when Dave Dragon (Hogan) makes a living in a live stage-show version of his show. But terrorists led by the glamorous Medusa (Loni Anderson) take over the park in an attempt to raise some ill-gotten funds from the park's owner (Denis Berkfeldt). Only the 3 Ninjas, together with their new neighbour's daughter Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine), can save the day! I understand that most family films have a lesser quality to their bigger-budgeted brethren but even so, "3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain" is a shocking waste of time, celluloid and talent. Not Hogan, obviously - he speaks most lines with the same level of interest as a train tannoy announcer - but Botuchis actually looks the part and even convinces in the fight scenes. The other two are hopeless but at least they match the same level as their adult co-stars. Anderson comes across as a cut-price version of her namesake Pamela while Jim Varney is wasted as her unfortunate right-hand man Lothar. The rest of the supporting cast are blighted by tragic lookalikes - the cop looked suspiciously like OJ Simpson while I was sure one of the goofy henchmen was actually Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones! Still, this film maintains the laws of kids battling adults laid out in films like "Home Alone" which clearly state that any adult can be incapacitated by violence so long as it is comic. So minor falls onto soft landings, mishaps at various fairground attractions and Jackie Chan-style prop use are all that's really required at any stage. I could go into greater detail about stuff I didn't like by listing things like a barely coherent plot that feels optional at times or a horrible sense when watching it that you're wasting your life perhaps. But I rise above such petty statements and besides, I reckon you get the picture by now. Even with the youngest of boys who believe everything they see in WWE programming, "3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain" won't do the trick. It's too dumb for younger viewers to enjoy and way too stupid for the rest of us. There are worse films out there - another Hogan family film from '98 by the name of "McCinsey's Island" has the dubious distinction of being one of the lowest scoring films I've ever seen - but why does Hollywood produce such poor movies that are meant for kids? Pixar can produce movies suitable for both adults and kids seemingly at will while the likes of Wallace & Gromit provide endlessly entertaining outings and have done for years. This, by contrast, feels as much fun as a detention. But at least I've not wasted my time completely by seeing this - learn from my experience, trust your instincts and keep the hell away from this turgid, unintelligent and frankly forgettable swansong for the 3 Ninjas.

    I reviewed this title back in November 2008, about 4 years ago, and while I still come to the conclusion that this movie still gets a rating of 1 because of how ridiculously bad it is, upon seeing it a few more times, I have to dig deeper into this movie and provide some more thoughts and ideas about it. First off, if you've seen the movie, Skip the next paragraph. In the recent years of the 3 Ninjas, They've grown older and more mature, and because of this, their interest in being ninjas has taken a backseat to more older things. While Tum-tum is still a young boy, Rocky has moved onto girlfriends, and Colt is merely stuck in the middle. Not only that, Tum-tum's Favorite Saturday morning hero, Dave Dragon, is about to cancel his 15-year long superhero show, due to low ratings and loss of interest. His final appearance will be at the Mega mountain theme park on tum-tum's birthday. So Tum-tum wants to go, and his older brothers tag along with their new friend, Amanda, who seems to be an expert on Computer Programming, hacking, and complex electronics. while at the theme park, a group of mercenary Ninjas, led by escaped convict, Mary Ann rogers, AKA Medusa, take over the theme park and threaten to harm it's people, but will let them go in exchange for a large sum of money. Will they succeed in their evildoing, or will the 3 ninjas save the day? OK, Upon seeing this movie a few more times and reading other comments left by users, There's lots to say now. First and foremost, i see 2 obvious references to mid-90s Role Playing games - First, look at Colt's hair. not only does it look ridiculous, it's a bad rip-off of Hero-class Bowie from shining force II, A sega Genesis RPG from 1994. Also, look at Amanda. Doesn't her character seem familiar to another girl from a 1995 SNES RPG? she does have thick glasses, knows her way around complex electronics and computers - Kinda like Lucca from Chrono Trigger maybe? Secondly, kids movies of the 90's can be totally remembered for kids outsmarting adults and leaving a trail of laughter in their wake. It started with Home alone, from 1990. Then it carried throughout the 90s, but around the mid-to-late 90s, the clich&eacute; got really old. this movie feeds off that clich&eacute; like Michael Moore feeds off of McDonalds. Thirdly, The aged stars of our show. First there's Hulk Hogan. Now i love wrestling, to me, it's entertainment and should not be looked at as a legitimate sport, cause it's not. Hulkamania was still running wild for the hulk at the time, he was in his 40s (if this was filmed in 1997, released in 1998, and hulk was born in 1953, he would've been 44 years old. For the most part, his acting isn't really believable, but his larger than life character in the ring more than makes up for it. then we have our other aged star, Loni Anderson. this was a few years after her divorce with Burt Reynolds, and i gotta admit, with all the leather, the make-up, lipstick, and sexy cougar voice, I was still turned on to her. How old was she around the time of filming? Well, she was born in 1945, making her 52 around the time of filming. Hot damn! But her acting skills in this film are as follows... Fourth, Loni Anderson might as well have starred in a porno, cause her acting skills, are totally unbelievable. And adding onto another user's comment, The Dialogue between Loni and Chelsey (Amanda) feels like watching a lesbian porno, about an aged beauty queen wanting to have her way with a young woman. So the bottom line, 3 Ninjas; High Noon at Mega Mountain isn't what you'd call a memorable film, i'd prefer the term "Boring Saturday afternoon fare." it's totally forgettable, the only reason i'll ever remember it is because Loni Anderson was a total cougar in it. I'd rather remember hulk hogan for his Wrestling matches. 1/10

    If I were to describe this film in one word, it would be "clich&eacute;". Since one word reviews are not allowed, I will have to elaborate. It seems the film makers were unable to think of anything original and just threw in every kids film gimmick they could find, except for cute animals that is. We have the classic conflict between older siblings wanting to be cool and the younger ones acting like kids. We have the three bumbling bad guys who get beaten up by little kids. We have the phony TV superhero becoming an actual hero. We have bad guys with guns who seem to never use them, nd if they do they never hit anyone. The list goes on and on, however there are other kids movies that do all of these things so much better, in 3 Ninjas it just becomes corny. The only original thing (not counting the other 3 Ninja films) is the fighting but that ends up being nothing but several minutes of three kids repeatedly shouting "Ai-ya". This clearly suffers being a sequel produced solely to cash in on the franchise. I say, go see the first one and skip this.

Looking at this movie from an adults perspective defeats the propose of this being a Children's MOVIE. From a child's perspective this movie is one of the best martial arts movies ever made. Think back to when you were a kid. Wouldn't you love to see a movie where kids your age can take on fully grown men and win? This movie was a favorite of mine growing up and I would still sit down and watch all of the 3 ninjas movies because they were so epic as a child.

    That math problem sums up this whole movie. It is "The Karate Kid" divided into three smaller karate kids. Then you times that by zero effort and you get one big fat goose egg of a movie. It is the fourth installment in the 3 Ninjas saga, and it is by far the worst. The other films I will review in time, but this is the big one. This is the one that everyone hates. It has terrible acting, terrible fight scenes, and an awful story. When it comes to the acting the only person I liked was Jim Varney, but that is not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. As you would expect the child acting fails completely. The 3 ninjas are all annoying especially the little one. As for Hulk Hogan I didn't hate the performance, but it is exactly what you would expect. Then we have the action which is terrible. It goes for fighting that is practically slapstick instead of actual fighting. That is something I hate about a lot of kung fu/karate movies. So many of them just go for laughs from kiddies instead of actual honor for the fighting. It insults it, and if I was a karate teacher I would spit on pieces of trash like this everyday. In my opinion martial arts should stay in the more adult categories. The only true exception I have seen for these largely kid friendly martial arts movies is "The Karate Kid" that's it. I can't wait for a day when another film like that comes around and shows kids what the art of combat is about instead of constant shots to the balls. Until then we get this. Also another thing terrible about the fighting that is unbearable is how they have weapons with knives, but they never use them. I know it's for kids, but if there is a terrorist in front of you and you have a knife that guy is getting stabbed. Have stabbing or lose the knives in my opinion. Also the fighting suffers from those clich&eacute; noises that are made when you make a punch. It gets really annoying quickly. Now we move on to the plot. It really all seems like an excuse to have Hulk Hogan. They might as well call it "Hulk and 3 Ninjas". He was what sold the film in the first place, but I am going to try and explain the plot. The ninjas go to an amusement park, and it gets taken over by terrorists. The only hope is the 3 ninjas, a smart girl with glasses, and Hulk Hogan......(3 hours of laughing later) Yeah that is one of the lamest excuses for a plot I have ever seen. Then we have dialogue which just like the fighting suffers from way to much childish humor. The jokes are very repetitive. The movie just isn't funny. I'm not going to give this film a 0 star rating. It's bad, but at least it isn't "Pocket Ninjas". Just saying the title of that movie makes me shiver. 1/2 of a star out of 4

    Uggh! This is a terrible film and this was obvious by the first scene. The film begins with three very white-bread kids being taught by their grandfather how to be ninjas in some sort of Mario Brothers-like training facility. Considering how similar all this looks to "Pocket Ninjas" (the #4 lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), I knew I was in for a painful time! Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!! And, oh God say it isn't so, it's up to the thee kids AND Hulk Hogan to save the day. Can it get any worse?!?! Well, with tons of lame stunts, tons of special effects and minimal acting, the answer is YES! To show the FBI that they mean business, once the baddies take over the park, they make certain rides go SLIGHTLY faster!!! What beasts!! In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents. Because of this and the constantly insipid writing, the film is a total bore to anyone older than about 6. So should this movie be on the infamous Bottom 100 list? I think probably not for two reasons. First, very, very young kids will enjoy this insipid crap--and to me, a film should not be on the list if it is in any way enjoyable. Second, the production values are not that terrible and the film makes no attempt to be anything more than it is--a dopey little film that would most likely make a parent kill themselves or the kids if they are forced to watch it!!

    Another wonderful addition into the 3 Ninjas series. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. Some audiences did like this addition, but it was amazing film like the other 3 Ninjas movies. 3 Ninjas are awesome totally. Great selection on bring the legend Hulk Hogan into the picture he was cool. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was also a classic and really good kids family film. A kick-butt action-comedy-family film. The boys, Mathew Botuchis, Michael J. O'Laskey II, and J.P. Roeske II were so awesome in this addition. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was so funny and full of true Martial Arts. Victor Wong who starred as Grandpa he did great and connected very well with the boys in this addition. Sean McNamara who directed film. Great work! Sean McNamara and Jeff Phillips thanks for writing such a amazing kick-butt story. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain rocks! We all remember watching the 3 Ninjas films as a kid and watching them via Television whenever they showed. 3 Ninjas was always a joy to watch because they kick-butt. There's nothing negative about the films itself. I recommend them for everyone and you should check them out if you haven't today. If you love them you'll love this one too. 3 Ninjas will forever rock your world. These boys are cool.

    Sometimes, I'm my own worst enemy. The paradox of being a movie critic is that when you encounter a movie that you know from others is gonna suck like no other, you find your interest growing and you make yourself watch it. But no more. After this, I've learnt my lesson - this was so bad that I've decided never to indulge my masochistic side ever again. All the signs were there - none of the returning cast (this is apparently the fourth movie in this franchise), Hulk Hogan topping the bill and a resolute grip on a place on IMDb's bottom 100. I should have seen this coming and to some extent, I did. But like "Batman & Robin" and "GI Joe: The Rise Of Cobra", I was quite unprepared for just how mind-numbingly boring and poorly made this family movie actually is. In case any of the others have passed you by, three young boys by the name of Rocky (Mathew Botuchis), Colt (Michael O'Laskey II) and Tum Tum (James Paul Roeske II) spend their summers training to become ninja with their grandpa (Victor Wong) with the apparent blessing of their parents (Alan McRae and Margarita Franco). When Tum Tum's favourite TV show is cancelled, they head off to nearby Mega Mountain theme park when Dave Dragon (Hogan) makes a living in a live stage-show version of his show. But terrorists led by the glamorous Medusa (Loni Anderson) take over the park in an attempt to raise some ill-gotten funds from the park's owner (Denis Berkfeldt). Only the 3 Ninjas, together with their new neighbour's daughter Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine), can save the day! I understand that most family films have a lesser quality to their bigger-budgeted brethren but even so, "3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain" is a shocking waste of time, celluloid and talent. Not Hogan, obviously - he speaks most lines with the same level of interest as a train tannoy announcer - but Botuchis actually looks the part and even convinces in the fight scenes. The other two are hopeless but at least they match the same level as their adult co-stars. Anderson comes across as a cut-price version of her namesake Pamela while Jim Varney is wasted as her unfortunate right-hand man Lothar. The rest of the supporting cast are blighted by tragic lookalikes - the cop looked suspiciously like OJ Simpson while I was sure one of the goofy henchmen was actually Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones! Still, this film maintains the laws of kids battling adults laid out in films like "Home Alone" which clearly state that any adult can be incapacitated by violence so long as it is comic. So minor falls onto soft landings, mishaps at various fairground attractions and Jackie Chan-style prop use are all that's really required at any stage. I could go into greater detail about stuff I didn't like by listing things like a barely coherent plot that feels optional at times or a horrible sense when watching it that you're wasting your life perhaps. But I rise above such petty statements and besides, I reckon you get the picture by now. Even with the youngest of boys who believe everything they see in WWE programming, "3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain" won't do the trick. It's too dumb for younger viewers to enjoy and way too stupid for the rest of us. There are worse films out there - another Hogan family film from '98 by the name of "McCinsey's Island" has the dubious distinction of being one of the lowest scoring films I've ever seen - but why does Hollywood produce such poor movies that are meant for kids? Pixar can produce movies suitable for both adults and kids seemingly at will while the likes of Wallace & Gromit provide endlessly entertaining outings and have done for years. This, by contrast, feels as much fun as a detention. But at least I've not wasted my time completely by seeing this - learn from my experience, trust your instincts and keep the hell away from this turgid, unintelligent and frankly forgettable swansong for the 3 Ninjas.

    I reviewed this title back in November 2008, about 4 years ago, and while I still come to the conclusion that this movie still gets a rating of 1 because of how ridiculously bad it is, upon seeing it a few more times, I have to dig deeper into this movie and provide some more thoughts and ideas about it. First off, if you've seen the movie, Skip the next paragraph. In the recent years of the 3 Ninjas, They've grown older and more mature, and because of this, their interest in being ninjas has taken a backseat to more older things. While Tum-tum is still a young boy, Rocky has moved onto girlfriends, and Colt is merely stuck in the middle. Not only that, Tum-tum's Favorite Saturday morning hero, Dave Dragon, is about to cancel his 15-year long superhero show, due to low ratings and loss of interest. His final appearance will be at the Mega mountain theme park on tum-tum's birthday. So Tum-tum wants to go, and his older brothers tag along with their new friend, Amanda, who seems to be an expert on Computer Programming, hacking, and complex electronics. while at the theme park, a group of mercenary Ninjas, led by escaped convict, Mary Ann rogers, AKA Medusa, take over the theme park and threaten to harm it's people, but will let them go in exchange for a large sum of money. Will they succeed in their evildoing, or will the 3 ninjas save the day? OK, Upon seeing this movie a few more times and reading other comments left by users, There's lots to say now. First and foremost, i see 2 obvious references to mid-90s Role Playing games - First, look at Colt's hair. not only does it look ridiculous, it's a bad rip-off of Hero-class Bowie from shining force II, A sega Genesis RPG from 1994. Also, look at Amanda. Doesn't her character seem familiar to another girl from a 1995 SNES RPG? she does have thick glasses, knows her way around complex electronics and computers - Kinda like Lucca from Chrono Trigger maybe? Secondly, kids movies of the 90's can be totally remembered for kids outsmarting adults and leaving a trail of laughter in their wake. It started with Home alone, from 1990. Then it carried throughout the 90s, but around the mid-to-late 90s, the clich&eacute; got really old. this movie feeds off that clich&eacute; like Michael Moore feeds off of McDonalds. Thirdly, The aged stars of our show. First there's Hulk Hogan. Now i love wrestling, to me, it's entertainment and should not be looked at as a legitimate sport, cause it's not. Hulkamania was still running wild for the hulk at the time, he was in his 40s (if this was filmed in 1997, released in 1998, and hulk was born in 1953, he would've been 44 years old. For the most part, his acting isn't really believable, but his larger than life character in the ring more than makes up for it. then we have our other aged star, Loni Anderson. this was a few years after her divorce with Burt Reynolds, and i gotta admit, with all the leather, the make-up, lipstick, and sexy cougar voice, I was still turned on to her. How old was she around the time of filming? Well, she was born in 1945, making her 52 around the time of filming. Hot damn! But her acting skills in this film are as follows... Fourth, Loni Anderson might as well have starred in a porno, cause her acting skills, are totally unbelievable. And adding onto another user's comment, The Dialogue between Loni and Chelsey (Amanda) feels like watching a lesbian porno, about an aged beauty queen wanting to have her way with a young woman. So the bottom line, 3 Ninjas; High Noon at Mega Mountain isn't what you'd call a memorable film, i'd prefer the term "Boring Saturday afternoon fare." it's totally forgettable, the only reason i'll ever remember it is because Loni Anderson was a total cougar in it. I'd rather remember hulk hogan for his Wrestling matches. 1/10

    If I were to describe this film in one word, it would be "clich&eacute;". Since one word reviews are not allowed, I will have to elaborate. It seems the film makers were unable to think of anything original and just threw in every kids film gimmick they could find, except for cute animals that is. We have the classic conflict between older siblings wanting to be cool and the younger ones acting like kids. We have the three bumbling bad guys who get beaten up by little kids. We have the phony TV superhero becoming an actual hero. We have bad guys with guns who seem to never use them, nd if they do they never hit anyone. The list goes on and on, however there are other kids movies that do all of these things so much better, in 3 Ninjas it just becomes corny. The only original thing (not counting the other 3 Ninja films) is the fighting but that ends up being nothing but several minutes of three kids repeatedly shouting "Ai-ya". This clearly suffers being a sequel produced solely to cash in on the franchise. I say, go see the first one and skip this.

    3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain starts as a young girl named Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine) & her family move into their new home in Hidden Shores, they are welcomed to the neighbourhood by brother's Colt (Michael O' Laskey II), TumTum (James Paul Roeske II) & Rocky (Mathew Botuchis) who are all going to an amusement park named Mega Mountain that afternoon & invite Amanda to join them. While at the theme park the three ninja brother's & Amanda become aware that it has been taken over by a group of thieves, armed with guns & in complete control of Mega Mountain they hold the owner to ransom. The three ninja brother's decide to fight back & with the help of ageing television action hero Dave Dragon (Hulk Hogan) take on the criminals, can they save the day or will the bad guy's win? Co-written & directed by Sean McNamara this rather violent & childish slapstick action comedy that isn't particularly great & pretty silly at times but I found it passed the time if nothing else. The script is a sort of childish Die Hard (1989) but instead of ruthless criminals there are bumbling bad guy's, instead of the high rise building they take over an amusement park, instead of a tough cop hero there are three bratty child ninjas & their geek female friend & instead of a wisecracking Bruce Willis we get a tired looking Hulk Hogan as a washed-up television star (art imitating life maybe?). Here in the UK this film was quite heavily cut by around four minutes for scenes of nunchukas, head butts, ear claps & a kid wetting himself & having just seen the uncut version I am not sure what to make of it, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is definitely aimed at a young audience with it's silly slapstick action & childish humour so the high levels of violence did sit a little uneasily with me. From the head butts to kicks & punches to sword fights & even a scene in which a young boy throw's darts at a man. Just think about how incredibly dangerous that is for a minute, seriously if someone threw a dart at you & it hit you in the face you would be in big trouble & another worrying aspect of 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is that none of this violence ever has any consequence. The guy who gets a dart thrown at him just catches it in his mouth, punches, kicks & being pushed off rooftops seem to cause no sort of injury to anyone & maybe it would have been better if the makers did emphasise how dangerous these techniques are. As an action comedy it moves along at a decent pace, it's silly & not particularly coherent (where did Amanda get that remote control helicopter from at the end? Why is everyone at the park enjoying themselves it being run by armed criminals?) & it's pretty predictable & safe in that the good guy's win & the bad guy's lose. The fights are played mostly for laughs with bumbling bad guy's being beaten up by kids, there's an exploding boat at the end & not much else in the way of action. One also has to say that Mega Mountain amusement park has some really lack security, I mean Amaanda manages to take explosives, razor sharp throwing cards, a razor bladed yo-yo & a remote control helicopter inside her backpack. Mega Mountain also seems to have many brilliantly placed CCTV cameras that track exactly what armed criminals want & from perfect angles. Filmed at Elitch Gardens amusement park in Denver in Colorado, rather sloppily made with poor continuity & lacklustre production values. The acting isn't great, the three ninja kids are terrible while Hulk Hogan seems bored & Loni Anderson is the main highlight as the whip cracking leather clad Medusa but what is someone dressed like that doing in a kids film? 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is a silly & childish action comedy that is probably a bit too violent for a film aimed at children & implies that violence has no consequence. I suppose it passes the time & as a silly Die Hard style kids comedy I thought it was watchable.

    The only reason I bought this DVD is because I'm such a fan of Varney's. I wouldn't have known about this movie much less get it if he wasn't in it. While lots of people rag on Hulk Hogan, he wasn't the worst actor. By far, the most wooden performance goes to Loni Anderson. If this is a family oriented movie, why in the world did they have her dress in that skanky leather outfit that was far too short? Terrible casting as far as Loni goes. She was supposed to be the evil Medusa but I didn't buy it. She just didn't have the quality of pulling off the 'bad guy' type of role. She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. I got a little tired of Tum Tum's 'Ay-yahs' after a while. They were too high pitched and over done. All 6 stars go to Jim Varney. I was actually rooting for Lothar to become successful in his mission for he was the only one of the bad guys with the brilliance to pull off the heist. He easily outshone all the stars, as usual. He always gives 100% to whatever role he played as you can see here. Jim and Victor were the two best actors in this movie. Maybe if Jim had cast and directed this, it would've been a bigger box office success. The man was a brilliant actor and a genius. If you're a fan of Varney's, then yes, get the movie just to watch him. Otherwise, don't bother.

    I have seen a lot of movies, old and new, good and bad. 3 Ninjas:High Noon at Mega Mountain is a really awful movie, not the all-time worst, but everything that makes a bad movie bad is in abundance in this wretched excuse of a movie. In fact, the only somewhat tolerable asset was the soundtrack, that was decent compared to how awful everything else was. What made the movie especially bad was the plot. It is incredibly lame and predictable, with one of the dumbest endings I have seen in recent memory. Production values-wise, the movie is not good either, the cinematography, sets and scenery are of shoddy quality and the editing is so slip-shod it hurts the eyes and makes the editing in a movie like The Medallion seem Oscar-worthy. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed with little or no drive or energy, while the script and direction are terrible. Same with the acting, the kids are all annoying, the villains are pathetic in both character and acting while Hulk Hogan has a poor character and is not given much to do. Overall, an awful film and not worth it. 1/10 Bethany Cox

If you love them you'll love this one too. 3 Ninjas will forever rock your world. These boys are cool.

    Sometimes, I'm my own worst enemy. The paradox of being a movie critic is that when you encounter a movie that you know from others is gonna suck like no other, you find your interest growing and you make yourself watch it. But no more. After this, I've learnt my lesson - this was so bad that I've decided never to indulge my masochistic side ever again. All the signs were there - none of the returning cast (this is apparently the fourth movie in this franchise), Hulk Hogan topping the bill and a resolute grip on a place on IMDb's bottom 100. I should have seen this coming and to some extent, I did. But like "Batman & Robin" and "GI Joe: The Rise Of Cobra", I was quite unprepared for just how mind-numbingly boring and poorly made this family movie actually is. In case any of the others have passed you by, three young boys by the name of Rocky (Mathew Botuchis), Colt (Michael O'Laskey II) and Tum Tum (James Paul Roeske II) spend their summers training to become ninja with their grandpa (Victor Wong) with the apparent blessing of their parents (Alan McRae and Margarita Franco). When Tum Tum's favourite TV show is cancelled, they head off to nearby Mega Mountain theme park when Dave Dragon (Hogan) makes a living in a live stage-show version of his show. But terrorists led by the glamorous Medusa (Loni Anderson) take over the park in an attempt to raise some ill-gotten funds from the park's owner (Denis Berkfeldt). Only the 3 Ninjas, together with their new neighbour's daughter Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine), can save the day! I understand that most family films have a lesser quality to their bigger-budgeted brethren but even so, "3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain" is a shocking waste of time, celluloid and talent. Not Hogan, obviously - he speaks most lines with the same level of interest as a train tannoy announcer - but Botuchis actually looks the part and even convinces in the fight scenes. The other two are hopeless but at least they match the same level as their adult co-stars. Anderson comes across as a cut-price version of her namesake Pamela while Jim Varney is wasted as her unfortunate right-hand man Lothar. The rest of the supporting cast are blighted by tragic lookalikes - the cop looked suspiciously like OJ Simpson while I was sure one of the goofy henchmen was actually Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones! Still, this film maintains the laws of kids battling adults laid out in films like "Home Alone" which clearly state that any adult can be incapacitated by violence so long as it is comic. So minor falls onto soft landings, mishaps at various fairground attractions and Jackie Chan-style prop use are all that's really required at any stage. I could go into greater detail about stuff I didn't like by listing things like a barely coherent plot that feels optional at times or a horrible sense when watching it that you're wasting your life perhaps. But I rise above such petty statements and besides, I reckon you get the picture by now. Even with the youngest of boys who believe everything they see in WWE programming, "3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain" won't do the trick. It's too dumb for younger viewers to enjoy and way too stupid for the rest of us. There are worse films out there - another Hogan family film from '98 by the name of "McCinsey's Island" has the dubious distinction of being one of the lowest scoring films I've ever seen - but why does Hollywood produce such poor movies that are meant for kids? Pixar can produce movies suitable for both adults and kids seemingly at will while the likes of Wallace & Gromit provide endlessly entertaining outings and have done for years. This, by contrast, feels as much fun as a detention. But at least I've not wasted my time completely by seeing this - learn from my experience, trust your instincts and keep the hell away from this turgid, unintelligent and frankly forgettable swansong for the 3 Ninjas.

    I reviewed this title back in November 2008, about 4 years ago, and while I still come to the conclusion that this movie still gets a rating of 1 because of how ridiculously bad it is, upon seeing it a few more times, I have to dig deeper into this movie and provide some more thoughts and ideas about it. First off, if you've seen the movie, Skip the next paragraph. In the recent years of the 3 Ninjas, They've grown older and more mature, and because of this, their interest in being ninjas has taken a backseat to more older things. While Tum-tum is still a young boy, Rocky has moved onto girlfriends, and Colt is merely stuck in the middle. Not only that, Tum-tum's Favorite Saturday morning hero, Dave Dragon, is about to cancel his 15-year long superhero show, due to low ratings and loss of interest. His final appearance will be at the Mega mountain theme park on tum-tum's birthday. So Tum-tum wants to go, and his older brothers tag along with their new friend, Amanda, who seems to be an expert on Computer Programming, hacking, and complex electronics. while at the theme park, a group of mercenary Ninjas, led by escaped convict, Mary Ann rogers, AKA Medusa, take over the theme park and threaten to harm it's people, but will let them go in exchange for a large sum of money. Will they succeed in their evildoing, or will the 3 ninjas save the day? OK, Upon seeing this movie a few more times and reading other comments left by users, There's lots to say now. First and foremost, i see 2 obvious references to mid-90s Role Playing games - First, look at Colt's hair. not only does it look ridiculous, it's a bad rip-off of Hero-class Bowie from shining force II, A sega Genesis RPG from 1994. Also, look at Amanda. Doesn't her character seem familiar to another girl from a 1995 SNES RPG? she does have thick glasses, knows her way around complex electronics and computers - Kinda like Lucca from Chrono Trigger maybe? Secondly, kids movies of the 90's can be totally remembered for kids outsmarting adults and leaving a trail of laughter in their wake. It started with Home alone, from 1990. Then it carried throughout the 90s, but around the mid-to-late 90s, the clich&eacute; got really old. this movie feeds off that clich&eacute; like Michael Moore feeds off of McDonalds. Thirdly, The aged stars of our show. First there's Hulk Hogan. Now i love wrestling, to me, it's entertainment and should not be looked at as a legitimate sport, cause it's not. Hulkamania was still running wild for the hulk at the time, he was in his 40s (if this was filmed in 1997, released in 1998, and hulk was born in 1953, he would've been 44 years old. For the most part, his acting isn't really believable, but his larger than life character in the ring more than makes up for it. then we have our other aged star, Loni Anderson. this was a few years after her divorce with Burt Reynolds, and i gotta admit, with all the leather, the make-up, lipstick, and sexy cougar voice, I was still turned on to her. How old was she around the time of filming? Well, she was born in 1945, making her 52 around the time of filming. Hot damn! But her acting skills in this film are as follows... Fourth, Loni Anderson might as well have starred in a porno, cause her acting skills, are totally unbelievable. And adding onto another user's comment, The Dialogue between Loni and Chelsey (Amanda) feels like watching a lesbian porno, about an aged beauty queen wanting to have her way with a young woman. So the bottom line, 3 Ninjas; High Noon at Mega Mountain isn't what you'd call a memorable film, i'd prefer the term "Boring Saturday afternoon fare." it's totally forgettable, the only reason i'll ever remember it is because Loni Anderson was a total cougar in it. I'd rather remember hulk hogan for his Wrestling matches. 1/10

    If I were to describe this film in one word, it would be "clich&eacute;". Since one word reviews are not allowed, I will have to elaborate. It seems the film makers were unable to think of anything original and just threw in every kids film gimmick they could find, except for cute animals that is. We have the classic conflict between older siblings wanting to be cool and the younger ones acting like kids. We have the three bumbling bad guys who get beaten up by little kids. We have the phony TV superhero becoming an actual hero. We have bad guys with guns who seem to never use them, nd if they do they never hit anyone. The list goes on and on, however there are other kids movies that do all of these things so much better, in 3 Ninjas it just becomes corny. The only original thing (not counting the other 3 Ninja films) is the fighting but that ends up being nothing but several minutes of three kids repeatedly shouting "Ai-ya". This clearly suffers being a sequel produced solely to cash in on the franchise. I say, go see the first one and skip this.

    3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain starts as a young girl named Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine) & her family move into their new home in Hidden Shores, they are welcomed to the neighbourhood by brother's Colt (Michael O' Laskey II), TumTum (James Paul Roeske II) & Rocky (Mathew Botuchis) who are all going to an amusement park named Mega Mountain that afternoon & invite Amanda to join them. While at the theme park the three ninja brother's & Amanda become aware that it has been taken over by a group of thieves, armed with guns & in complete control of Mega Mountain they hold the owner to ransom. The three ninja brother's decide to fight back & with the help of ageing television action hero Dave Dragon (Hulk Hogan) take on the criminals, can they save the day or will the bad guy's win? Co-written & directed by Sean McNamara this rather violent & childish slapstick action comedy that isn't particularly great & pretty silly at times but I found it passed the time if nothing else. The script is a sort of childish Die Hard (1989) but instead of ruthless criminals there are bumbling bad guy's, instead of the high rise building they take over an amusement park, instead of a tough cop hero there are three bratty child ninjas & their geek female friend & instead of a wisecracking Bruce Willis we get a tired looking Hulk Hogan as a washed-up television star (art imitating life maybe?). Here in the UK this film was quite heavily cut by around four minutes for scenes of nunchukas, head butts, ear claps & a kid wetting himself & having just seen the uncut version I am not sure what to make of it, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is definitely aimed at a young audience with it's silly slapstick action & childish humour so the high levels of violence did sit a little uneasily with me. From the head butts to kicks & punches to sword fights & even a scene in which a young boy throw's darts at a man. Just think about how incredibly dangerous that is for a minute, seriously if someone threw a dart at you & it hit you in the face you would be in big trouble & another worrying aspect of 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is that none of this violence ever has any consequence. The guy who gets a dart thrown at him just catches it in his mouth, punches, kicks & being pushed off rooftops seem to cause no sort of injury to anyone & maybe it would have been better if the makers did emphasise how dangerous these techniques are. As an action comedy it moves along at a decent pace, it's silly & not particularly coherent (where did Amanda get that remote control helicopter from at the end? Why is everyone at the park enjoying themselves it being run by armed criminals?) & it's pretty predictable & safe in that the good guy's win & the bad guy's lose. The fights are played mostly for laughs with bumbling bad guy's being beaten up by kids, there's an exploding boat at the end & not much else in the way of action. One also has to say that Mega Mountain amusement park has some really lack security, I mean Amaanda manages to take explosives, razor sharp throwing cards, a razor bladed yo-yo & a remote control helicopter inside her backpack. Mega Mountain also seems to have many brilliantly placed CCTV cameras that track exactly what armed criminals want & from perfect angles. Filmed at Elitch Gardens amusement park in Denver in Colorado, rather sloppily made with poor continuity & lacklustre production values. The acting isn't great, the three ninja kids are terrible while Hulk Hogan seems bored & Loni Anderson is the main highlight as the whip cracking leather clad Medusa but what is someone dressed like that doing in a kids film? 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is a silly & childish action comedy that is probably a bit too violent for a film aimed at children & implies that violence has no consequence. I suppose it passes the time & as a silly Die Hard style kids comedy I thought it was watchable.

    The only reason I bought this DVD is because I'm such a fan of Varney's. I wouldn't have known about this movie much less get it if he wasn't in it. While lots of people rag on Hulk Hogan, he wasn't the worst actor. By far, the most wooden performance goes to Loni Anderson. If this is a family oriented movie, why in the world did they have her dress in that skanky leather outfit that was far too short? Terrible casting as far as Loni goes. She was supposed to be the evil Medusa but I didn't buy it. She just didn't have the quality of pulling off the 'bad guy' type of role. She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. I got a little tired of Tum Tum's 'Ay-yahs' after a while. They were too high pitched and over done. All 6 stars go to Jim Varney. I was actually rooting for Lothar to become successful in his mission for he was the only one of the bad guys with the brilliance to pull off the heist. He easily outshone all the stars, as usual. He always gives 100% to whatever role he played as you can see here. Jim and Victor were the two best actors in this movie. Maybe if Jim had cast and directed this, it would've been a bigger box office success. The man was a brilliant actor and a genius. If you're a fan of Varney's, then yes, get the movie just to watch him. Otherwise, don't bother.

    I have seen a lot of movies, old and new, good and bad. 3 Ninjas:High Noon at Mega Mountain is a really awful movie, not the all-time worst, but everything that makes a bad movie bad is in abundance in this wretched excuse of a movie. In fact, the only somewhat tolerable asset was the soundtrack, that was decent compared to how awful everything else was. What made the movie especially bad was the plot. It is incredibly lame and predictable, with one of the dumbest endings I have seen in recent memory. Production values-wise, the movie is not good either, the cinematography, sets and scenery are of shoddy quality and the editing is so slip-shod it hurts the eyes and makes the editing in a movie like The Medallion seem Oscar-worthy. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed with little or no drive or energy, while the script and direction are terrible. Same with the acting, the kids are all annoying, the villains are pathetic in both character and acting while Hulk Hogan has a poor character and is not given much to do. Overall, an awful film and not worth it. 1/10 Bethany Cox

    Hasn't anyone ever dreamed of being a ninja as a child? I watched this movie years ago and would have told you then that the 3 ninjas movies were the absolute best movies ever made. Looking at this movie from an adults perspective defeats the propose of this being a Children's MOVIE. From a child's perspective this movie is one of the best martial arts movies ever made. Think back to when you were a kid. Wouldn't you love to see a movie where kids your age can take on fully grown men and win? This movie was a favorite of mine growing up and I would still sit down and watch all of the 3 ninjas movies because they were so epic as a child.

    That math problem sums up this whole movie. It is "The Karate Kid" divided into three smaller karate kids. Then you times that by zero effort and you get one big fat goose egg of a movie. It is the fourth installment in the 3 Ninjas saga, and it is by far the worst. The other films I will review in time, but this is the big one. This is the one that everyone hates. It has terrible acting, terrible fight scenes, and an awful story. When it comes to the acting the only person I liked was Jim Varney, but that is not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. As you would expect the child acting fails completely. The 3 ninjas are all annoying especially the little one. As for Hulk Hogan I didn't hate the performance, but it is exactly what you would expect. Then we have the action which is terrible. It goes for fighting that is practically slapstick instead of actual fighting. That is something I hate about a lot of kung fu/karate movies. So many of them just go for laughs from kiddies instead of actual honor for the fighting. It insults it, and if I was a karate teacher I would spit on pieces of trash like this everyday. In my opinion martial arts should stay in the more adult categories. The only true exception I have seen for these largely kid friendly martial arts movies is "The Karate Kid" that's it. I can't wait for a day when another film like that comes around and shows kids what the art of combat is about instead of constant shots to the balls. Until then we get this. Also another thing terrible about the fighting that is unbearable is how they have weapons with knives, but they never use them. I know it's for kids, but if there is a terrorist in front of you and you have a knife that guy is getting stabbed. Have stabbing or lose the knives in my opinion. Also the fighting suffers from those clich&eacute; noises that are made when you make a punch. It gets really annoying quickly. Now we move on to the plot. It really all seems like an excuse to have Hulk Hogan. They might as well call it "Hulk and 3 Ninjas". He was what sold the film in the first place, but I am going to try and explain the plot. The ninjas go to an amusement park, and it gets taken over by terrorists. The only hope is the 3 ninjas, a smart girl with glasses, and Hulk Hogan......(3 hours of laughing later) Yeah that is one of the lamest excuses for a plot I have ever seen. Then we have dialogue which just like the fighting suffers from way to much childish humor. The jokes are very repetitive. The movie just isn't funny. I'm not going to give this film a 0 star rating. It's bad, but at least it isn't "Pocket Ninjas". Just saying the title of that movie makes me shiver. 1/2 of a star out of 4

    Uggh! This is a terrible film and this was obvious by the first scene. The film begins with three very white-bread kids being taught by their grandfather how to be ninjas in some sort of Mario Brothers-like training facility. Considering how similar all this looks to "Pocket Ninjas" (the #4 lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), I knew I was in for a painful time! Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!! And, oh God say it isn't so, it's up to the thee kids AND Hulk Hogan to save the day. Can it get any worse?!?! Well, with tons of lame stunts, tons of special effects and minimal acting, the answer is YES! To show the FBI that they mean business, once the baddies take over the park, they make certain rides go SLIGHTLY faster!!! What beasts!! In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents. Because of this and the constantly insipid writing, the film is a total bore to anyone older than about 6. So should this movie be on the infamous Bottom 100 list? I think probably not for two reasons. First, very, very young kids will enjoy this insipid crap--and to me, a film should not be on the list if it is in any way enjoyable. Second, the production values are not that terrible and the film makes no attempt to be anything more than it is--a dopey little film that would most likely make a parent kill themselves or the kids if they are forced to watch it!!

    Another wonderful addition into the 3 Ninjas series. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. Some audiences did like this addition, but it was amazing film like the other 3 Ninjas movies. 3 Ninjas are awesome totally. Great selection on bring the legend Hulk Hogan into the picture he was cool. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was also a classic and really good kids family film. A kick-butt action-comedy-family film. The boys, Mathew Botuchis, Michael J. O'Laskey II, and J.P. Roeske II were so awesome in this addition. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain was so funny and full of true Martial Arts. Victor Wong who starred as Grandpa he did great and connected very well with the boys in this addition. Sean McNamara who directed film. Great work! Sean McNamara and Jeff Phillips thanks for writing such a amazing kick-butt story. 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain rocks! We all remember watching the 3 Ninjas films as a kid and watching them via Television whenever they showed. 3 Ninjas was always a joy to watch because they kick-butt. There's nothing negative about the films itself. I recommend them for everyone and you should check them out if you haven't today.

Thirdly, The aged stars of our show. First there's Hulk Hogan. Now i love wrestling, to me, it's entertainment and should not be looked at as a legitimate sport, cause it's not. Hulkamania was still running wild for the hulk at the time, he was in his 40s (if this was filmed in 1997, released in 1998, and hulk was born in 1953, he would've been 44 years old. For the most part, his acting isn't really believable, but his larger than life character in the ring more than makes up for it. then we have our other aged star, Loni Anderson. this was a few years after her divorce with Burt Reynolds, and i gotta admit, with all the leather, the make-up, lipstick, and sexy cougar voice, I was still turned on to her. How old was she around the time of filming? Well, she was born in 1945, making her 52 around the time of filming. Hot damn! But her acting skills in this film are as follows... Fourth, Loni Anderson might as well have starred in a porno, cause her acting skills, are totally unbelievable. And adding onto another user's comment, The Dialogue between Loni and Chelsey (Amanda) feels like watching a lesbian porno, about an aged beauty queen wanting to have her way with a young woman. So the bottom line, 3 Ninjas; High Noon at Mega Mountain isn't what you'd call a memorable film, i'd prefer the term "Boring Saturday afternoon fare." it's totally forgettable, the only reason i'll ever remember it is because Loni Anderson was a total cougar in it. I'd rather remember hulk hogan for his Wrestling matches. 1/10

    If I were to describe this film in one word, it would be "clich&eacute;". Since one word reviews are not allowed, I will have to elaborate. It seems the film makers were unable to think of anything original and just threw in every kids film gimmick they could find, except for cute animals that is. We have the classic conflict between older siblings wanting to be cool and the younger ones acting like kids. We have the three bumbling bad guys who get beaten up by little kids. We have the phony TV superhero becoming an actual hero. We have bad guys with guns who seem to never use them, nd if they do they never hit anyone. The list goes on and on, however there are other kids movies that do all of these things so much better, in 3 Ninjas it just becomes corny. The only original thing (not counting the other 3 Ninja films) is the fighting but that ends up being nothing but several minutes of three kids repeatedly shouting "Ai-ya". This clearly suffers being a sequel produced solely to cash in on the franchise. I say, go see the first one and skip this.

    3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain starts as a young girl named Amanda (Chelsey Earlywine) & her family move into their new home in Hidden Shores, they are welcomed to the neighbourhood by brother's Colt (Michael O' Laskey II), TumTum (James Paul Roeske II) & Rocky (Mathew Botuchis) who are all going to an amusement park named Mega Mountain that afternoon & invite Amanda to join them. While at the theme park the three ninja brother's & Amanda become aware that it has been taken over by a group of thieves, armed with guns & in complete control of Mega Mountain they hold the owner to ransom. The three ninja brother's decide to fight back & with the help of ageing television action hero Dave Dragon (Hulk Hogan) take on the criminals, can they save the day or will the bad guy's win? Co-written & directed by Sean McNamara this rather violent & childish slapstick action comedy that isn't particularly great & pretty silly at times but I found it passed the time if nothing else. The script is a sort of childish Die Hard (1989) but instead of ruthless criminals there are bumbling bad guy's, instead of the high rise building they take over an amusement park, instead of a tough cop hero there are three bratty child ninjas & their geek female friend & instead of a wisecracking Bruce Willis we get a tired looking Hulk Hogan as a washed-up television star (art imitating life maybe?). Here in the UK this film was quite heavily cut by around four minutes for scenes of nunchukas, head butts, ear claps & a kid wetting himself & having just seen the uncut version I am not sure what to make of it, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is definitely aimed at a young audience with it's silly slapstick action & childish humour so the high levels of violence did sit a little uneasily with me. From the head butts to kicks & punches to sword fights & even a scene in which a young boy throw's darts at a man. Just think about how incredibly dangerous that is for a minute, seriously if someone threw a dart at you & it hit you in the face you would be in big trouble & another worrying aspect of 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is that none of this violence ever has any consequence. The guy who gets a dart thrown at him just catches it in his mouth, punches, kicks & being pushed off rooftops seem to cause no sort of injury to anyone & maybe it would have been better if the makers did emphasise how dangerous these techniques are. As an action comedy it moves along at a decent pace, it's silly & not particularly coherent (where did Amanda get that remote control helicopter from at the end? Why is everyone at the park enjoying themselves it being run by armed criminals?) & it's pretty predictable & safe in that the good guy's win & the bad guy's lose. The fights are played mostly for laughs with bumbling bad guy's being beaten up by kids, there's an exploding boat at the end & not much else in the way of action. One also has to say that Mega Mountain amusement park has some really lack security, I mean Amaanda manages to take explosives, razor sharp throwing cards, a razor bladed yo-yo & a remote control helicopter inside her backpack. Mega Mountain also seems to have many brilliantly placed CCTV cameras that track exactly what armed criminals want & from perfect angles. Filmed at Elitch Gardens amusement park in Denver in Colorado, rather sloppily made with poor continuity & lacklustre production values. The acting isn't great, the three ninja kids are terrible while Hulk Hogan seems bored & Loni Anderson is the main highlight as the whip cracking leather clad Medusa but what is someone dressed like that doing in a kids film? 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain is a silly & childish action comedy that is probably a bit too violent for a film aimed at children & implies that violence has no consequence. I suppose it passes the time & as a silly Die Hard style kids comedy I thought it was watchable.

    The only reason I bought this DVD is because I'm such a fan of Varney's. I wouldn't have known about this movie much less get it if he wasn't in it. While lots of people rag on Hulk Hogan, he wasn't the worst actor. By far, the most wooden performance goes to Loni Anderson. If this is a family oriented movie, why in the world did they have her dress in that skanky leather outfit that was far too short? Terrible casting as far as Loni goes. She was supposed to be the evil Medusa but I didn't buy it. She just didn't have the quality of pulling off the 'bad guy' type of role. She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. I got a little tired of Tum Tum's 'Ay-yahs' after a while. They were too high pitched and over done. All 6 stars go to Jim Varney. I was actually rooting for Lothar to become successful in his mission for he was the only one of the bad guys with the brilliance to pull off the heist. He easily outshone all the stars, as usual. He always gives 100% to whatever role he played as you can see here. Jim and Victor were the two best actors in this movie. Maybe if Jim had cast and directed this, it would've been a bigger box office success. The man was a brilliant actor and a genius. If you're a fan of Varney's, then yes, get the movie just to watch him. Otherwise, don't bother.

    I have seen a lot of movies, old and new, good and bad. 3 Ninjas:High Noon at Mega Mountain is a really awful movie, not the all-time worst, but everything that makes a bad movie bad is in abundance in this wretched excuse of a movie. In fact, the only somewhat tolerable asset was the soundtrack, that was decent compared to how awful everything else was. What made the movie especially bad was the plot. It is incredibly lame and predictable, with one of the dumbest endings I have seen in recent memory. Production values-wise, the movie is not good either, the cinematography, sets and scenery are of shoddy quality and the editing is so slip-shod it hurts the eyes and makes the editing in a movie like The Medallion seem Oscar-worthy. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed with little or no drive or energy, while the script and direction are terrible. Same with the acting, the kids are all annoying, the villains are pathetic in both character and acting while Hulk Hogan has a poor character and is not given much to do. Overall, an awful film and not worth it. 1/10 Bethany Cox

    Hasn't anyone ever dreamed of being a ninja as a child? I watched this movie years ago and would have told you then that the 3 ninjas movies were the absolute best movies ever made. Looking at this movie from an adults perspective defeats the propose of this being a Children's MOVIE. From a child's perspective this movie is one of the best martial arts movies ever made. Think back to when you were a kid. Wouldn't you love to see a movie where kids your age can take on fully grown men and win? This movie was a favorite of mine growing up and I would still sit down and watch all of the 3 ninjas movies because they were so epic as a child.

    That math problem sums up this whole movie. It is "The Karate Kid" divided into three smaller karate kids. Then you times that by zero effort and you get one big fat goose egg of a movie. It is the fourth installment in the 3 Ninjas saga, and it is by far the worst. The other films I will review in time, but this is the big one. This is the one that everyone hates. It has terrible acting, terrible fight scenes, and an awful story. When it comes to the acting the only person I liked was Jim Varney, but that is not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. As you would expect the child acting fails completely. The 3 ninjas are all annoying especially the little one. As for Hulk Hogan I didn't hate the performance, but it is exactly what you would expect. Then we have the action which is terrible. It goes for fighting that is practically slapstick instead of actual fighting. That is something I hate about a lot of kung fu/karate movies. So many of them just go for laughs from kiddies instead of actual honor for the fighting. It insults it, and if I was a karate teacher I would spit on pieces of trash like this everyday. In my opinion martial arts should stay in the more adult categories. The only true exception I have seen for these largely kid friendly martial arts movies is "The Karate Kid" that's it. I can't wait for a day when another film like that comes around and shows kids what the art of combat is about instead of constant shots to the balls. Until then we get this. Also another thing terrible about the fighting that is unbearable is how they have weapons with knives, but they never use them. I know it's for kids, but if there is a terrorist in front of you and you have a knife that guy is getting stabbed. Have stabbing or lose the knives in my opinion. Also the fighting suffers from those clich&eacute; noises that are made when you make a punch. It gets really annoying quickly. Now we move on to the plot. It really all seems like an excuse to have Hulk Hogan. They might as well call it "Hulk and 3 Ninjas". He was what sold the film in the first place, but I am going to try and explain the plot. The ninjas go to an amusement park, and it gets taken over by terrorists. The only hope is the 3 ninjas, a smart girl with glasses, and Hulk Hogan......(3 hours of laughing later) Yeah that is one of the lamest excuses for a plot I have ever seen. Then we have dialogue which just like the fighting suffers from way to much childish humor. The jokes are very repetitive. The movie just isn't funny. I'm not going to give this film a 0 star rating. It's bad, but at least it isn't "Pocket Ninjas". Just saying the title of that movie makes me shiver. 1/2 of a star out of 4

    Uggh! This is a terrible film and this was obvious by the first scene. The film begins with three very white-bread kids being taught by their grandfather how to be ninjas in some sort of Mario Brothers-like training facility. Considering how similar all this looks to "Pocket Ninjas" (the #4 lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), I knew I was in for a painful time! Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!! And, oh God say it isn't so, it's up to the thee kids AND Hulk Hogan to save the day. Can it get any worse?!?! Well, with tons of lame stunts, tons of special effects and minimal acting, the answer is YES! To show the FBI that they mean business, once the baddies take over the park, they make certain rides go SLIGHTLY faster!!! What beasts!! In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents. Because of this and the constantly insipid writing, the film is a total bore to anyone older than about 6. So should this movie be on the infamous Bottom 100 list? I think probably not for two reasons. First, very, very young kids will enjoy this insipid crap--and to me, a film should not be on the list if it is in any way enjoyable. Second, the production values are not that terrible and the film makes no attempt to be anything more than it is--a dopey little film that would most likely make a parent kill themselves or the kids if they are forced to watch it!!
